# Master Project 

The purpose of this project is to extract information from the book “Andy Warhol Diaries” by using state-of-art methods. Natural Language Processing(NLP) deals with how machines can derive meaning from text or speech. This project focuses on NLP tasks, specifically Named Entity Recognition(NER) and Sentiment Analysis(SA) for gathering the necessary information. NER aims to get person, location, organization related information and SA detects the conveyed sentiment of passages which may be positive or negative. These NLP tasks are handled by the transformer-based machine learning technique, BERT, and its more lightweight version, DistilBERT.
