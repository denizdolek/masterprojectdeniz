"Friday, April 1, 1977","[Aly Kaiser, Joe Eula]",0.05592592592592592,"Went to Halston's birthday dinner for Victor at Pearl's he did not want to do a big thing at the house. Joe Eula was there. And Aly Kaiser. She has two bodyguards now because of her Greek husband that she is divorcing-she has one bodyguard driving her and one at home. She had as a present for Victor a bag of Hawaiian marijuana that a couple of fag friends who have a ranch there mailed to her in a box of perfumed shirts so you would not smell the marijuana. She said she gave some to one of her bodyguards and he was passed out at home. She says she will let me take pictures of her as soon as she gets her divorce. Before it was ""as soon as I get the plastic in my face from Dr. Orentreich."" I talked to Dr. Giller he seems so sensible. He said that only fish and chicken and fresh vegetables were good for you even though he himself liked Chinese food. He told Mrs. Kaiser where she could get fresh chickens kosher on the Lower East Side and she said she would send one of her bodyguards down for some she is been sending him out to do her shopping. She was wearing twenty carats on each ear and a diamond bracelet too. she is really nice. She had a car out front too with her dog who wears the chauffeur's cap."
"Friday, April 1, 1983","[Joe MacDonald, Miguel Bose, Muhammad Ali, Ronnie Levin]",0.31666666666666665,I had to meet Miguel Bose (cab $6). He came to be photographed and to work on the video thing. His mother's a famous actress in Spain and his father's a bullfighter. He told me that his good friend was Joe MacDonald so I guess maybe he was trying to tell me something. But when I told him that Joe had AIDS I think I really told him something because he looked nervous and scared. I see that Veronica and Muhammad Ali have split up and I bet it is because of the big spending habits she learned from her best friend Ronnie Levin because she went shopping all the time with him in Beverly Hills for antiques and Muhammad would get all the bills.
"Friday, April 11, 1980","[Ellsworth Kelly, Henry Geldzahler, Jackie Curtis, Mayor Koch, Ron Feldman]",-0.0076699770817417945,"Henry Geldzahler came by to talk about me doing a poster for New York City and Fred thought it was a good idea. Then Henry wanted to go right out and photograph a tree for the poster. He needs it in two weeks. But I am just beginning to think Henry may be crazy. He said Ellsworth Kelly wanted to paint on top of my portrait of him and I said sure but then he admitted that he wanted me to print another one so he was just trying to get a free painting out of me for Ellsworth Kelly to paint on. He still wears his badge that Mayor Koch gave him under his lapel. Rupert came in and we were numbering portfolios. The Ten Jewish Geniuses portfolio really sold so now Ron Feldman wants to do Ten Rock Stars but that is corny is not it? Or Ten Phantoms like Santa Claus. But I think the Jewish Geniuses only sold because they were Jewish so we should do Ten Jewish something else. Like Ten Jewish Rock Stars. I called Harcourt Brace and screamed at them for not delivering the eighty books that I paid for. Jackie Curtis came up to get one and heard me screaming on the phone at them and got the message and backed right out. And I screamed at a few people and finally the girl said ""Well you paid with a personal check and we had to wait to see if it cleared."" Can you believe it! I think Jovanovich must be so petty himself because he runs the worst company they are small-time they have got a name Harcourt Brace but that is all. So that screaming took all afternoon."
"Friday, April 13, 1979","[Lucie Arnaz, Margaret Trudeau, Robin Williams]",0.06944444444444445,I was reading the Margaret Trudeau book. She writes like Viva. If Viva had met interesting people in her life she would have written a book like this. Went to the Copa for the Mork show. Robin Williams. He was terrific. Jed's sister Susan was our waitress (tip $10). Then Mork's wife invited us to the Sherry so we went over there and Lucie Arnaz was there too and everybody was sitting around a big table of bagels. Mork has a hairy chest and arms but pretty blue eyes.
"Friday, April 13, 1984",[],-0.02391975308641975,We photographed the street people in front of the Public Library and it was fun. One man with chains and I gave him change ($2) and then people were interviewing me. And I am going to do that more. I did not get photo releases but I think I will start carrying some with me every day. Worked till 7:00. Then had to meet Jon dinner at Woods ($80). Then ran up to see Friday the 13th on 86th Street (cab $3) and it was the most peculiar mix of a crowd-rich preppie kids and black kids and the whole theater was a constant screaming riot everybody jumping up and down. It was the weirdest experience ever. And the murders were so gruesome. I want to do a movie called Stalk the City where there is a murder a minute. This movie opened in 1500 theaters. it is (laughs) a Paramount picture.
"Friday, April 14, 1978","[Averil Meyer, Elsa Peretti, Howard Cosell, Margaret Trudeau, Mickey Mantle, Reggie Jackson, Richard Weisman, Suzy Chapstick, Tom Sullivan, Yogi Berra]",0.01439102564102564,"Went with Richard Weisman to the Hotel Americana for a banquet for the Yankees. The master of ceremonies was Howard Cosell and they marched the whole team in. Everyone was trying to get Reggie Jackson's autograph. And it was funny because Averil Meyer's grandmother Mrs. Payson owns the Mets and Averil kept saying ""I own the Mets"" and everybody thought she was crazy. She wrote Yogi Berra a note and passed it on toward him but someone did not pass it along and so she got up and went and took it back. He used to be with the Mets. The note said something like: ""Remember when you bounced me on your knee then gave me a hot dog in the dugout?"" And Mickey Mantle got his award-that is what it was for. And Howard Cosell was introducing people from the dais and he introduced me he called me a Pop artist-I guess Richard is pushing to get the paintings sold. I talked to Suzy Chapstick and she said that she is noticed that most girls who get famous are tomboys when they are little and I said that I would been a tomboy. And then at the office there was the big problem with Halston. He called Fred to say that Victor's been going around saying that if Halston did not pay us the money he owes for the paintings he bought from us that he Victor would repossess them and sell them to Elsa Peretti. Halston asked Fred if we would put Victor up to it. Fred said no. And Halston's fired everyone at the house -Lorenzo and the maid too. All since last weekend. And he is having trouble with his line he can not work he is been so upset. The other night in the basement at 54 there was a huge fight that Elsa started-she was attacking Stevie and calling everybody faggots and it was really bad I guess. I was not there. Bob finally got her to leave with him. it is enough to make you want to stay home for the rest of your life. She was smashing glasses and everything. So between Victor and Elsa Halston's really a wreck. The other big event at the office in the afternoon was when Ronnie opened the door to the bathroom in the conference room-that lock does not really work-and there was Margaret Trudeau sitting on the toilet with her pants down and a coke spoon up her nose. He said ""Excuse me"" and backed out. she would come down with Tom Sullivan."
"Friday, April 15, 1977","[Carole Rogers, Diana Vreeland, Tony Ingrassia]",0.084508547008547,"We had our first nut at 860 yesterday-Diane Coffman came up. we have had nuts before but not one that we knew. She was in our play Pork in '70 or '71. The director Tony Ingrassia must have discovered her. She kept saying ""You know how to spell Coffman? C-O-F-F-M-A-N."" Had to give her money ($10). Lunch was for Diana Vreeland and an Argentinian woman and Bob had invited Michael and Pat York. Carole Rogers and Sally from Interview had invited a hi-fi girl to try to sell her ads. The girl was impressed with Diana and the Yorks she thought she was just going to have lunch with Carole and Sally. Diana was saying that she would discovered the museum had turned the lights up and the music down on her Russian costume show-they said it was because some people had complained they could not see anything and the music was too loud. Diana said that you do not go change something because somebody asks you to that that is the trouble with this country they want to ""give the public what it wants."" ""Well"" she said ""the public wants what it can not get and it is up to museums to teach them what to want."" And she said that is the trouble with Vogue magazine and all the other magazines today-except for Interview she said."
"Friday, April 15, 1983",[],0.3375,-St. Martin The most beautiful day in the world. Photographed all day.
"Friday, April 17, 1981","[Chris Makos, Dominique Sanda]",0.012500000000000004,I was depressed I decided to pass out Interviews. After I did that I went to the office and I ran into the Moynihan girl Maura who was arriving two days late for lunch (cab $5). And now that the Soho News had Dominique Sanda on its cover this week it would be too tacky to have her as our cover girl so maybe we will use this Moynihan girl as our cover because she is cute and smart-she went to Harvard-and she has a rock band. Chris Makos called me from Palm Beach where it was so sunny and he was with his boyfriend Peter and that depressed me they would just gotten there. Worked till 6:30. Rupert invited me to an all-boy party on Bleecker Street but I was too depressed. Ate at the Brasserie ($40). Went home lonely and despondent because nobody loves me and it is Easter and I cried.
"Friday, April 19, 1985",[],0.05625841750841751,"It was an all-day crystal day. The big cheese Dr. Reese was in town and my appointment was for 12:0 at Bernsohn's-he was taking me to lunch with Reese and they were going to do my cranium. I asked Reese how he started in crystals and he said that when he was little ""Mr. Morning"" came to see him. When he was a baby. He saw ""Mr. Morning"" but nobody else did. And then in the army he got interested in electricity and the body and all this stuff. Reese was talking about his trip where he went around sticking crystals all over the pyramids and the Wailing Wall. And he eats things like coffee and doughnuts. But he cures the coffee by passing the crystal over it ten times. And he says he knows somebody in South Africa who went to the Wailing Wall who now wants to get his money out of South Africa and do movies. Reese is Episcopalian so I feel better with him than with the Jewish crystal people somehow because knowing he believes in Christ I do not have to worry that crystals might be somehow against Christ. And his assistant -this girl-kept asking him ""Should we tell him? Should we tell him what we want him to do?"" And finally Reese said ""Yes."" So the girl said ""Your forces are with us. you have got to come to Tibet with us. You have the ability to do great things."" And then they do talk about needing people to support their studies. So do you think they are going to ask me for money? That that is it? Bernsohn is so materialistic-the new laser-beam record players and the new apartment. Then they tell me I was Chinese in my other life and that I have to go to Tibet with them.... Look I know the people are ridiculous but it is the crystals I believe in. They do work. When you think that these crystals were in the center of the earth and have all this energy... Oh and I got a letter from my niece Eva in Denver that said ""God Bless You and by the way I stole your drawings ten years ago do you want them back?"" In like 1970 when she was living here and taking care of my mother. She told me she rolled up some of my Flower prints and took them and they have been in her basement. But her letter is so full of God Bless Yous and Our Blessed Home and Our Blessed everythings that she sounds like one of the Moral Majority. And my nephew Paul is still in Denver-the ex-priest who is married to the ex-nun and they have two children."
"Friday, April 20, 1979",[],0.16666666666666666,Talked on the phone to Henry Post. he is getting better. They restructured his nose.
"Friday, April 21, 1978","[Joe Eula, Margaret Trudeau, Marilyn Monroe, Matt Collins, Milton Greene]",0.08683346065699006,"Milton Greene was at lunch at the office and he said that I would given him the idea to do a Marilyn Monroe portfolio so he is selling ten photographs of her for $3800. Fred told him he thought that was high but he said he is already sold a few to museums. But I do not know the photographs are not even that good. And it seems like they were all taken in the same sitting. He and Marilyn had that company together they did The Prince and the Showgirl. I know Milton because he and Joe Eula were the nicest to me on the first day I came to New York-he and Joe were close for years but then later Milton married Amy. Somebody had given me their names to look them up and I did and they told me I could use their phone and everything but I never took them up on it because (laughs) they were so nice it scared me. And Matt Collins the big male model came by. he is so good-looking and Brigid got a kiss out of him. And Margaret Trudeau was there and said she will do the Rums of Puerto Rico ad for me. I wanted to go home but Carole of Toni and Carole wanted us to see her new apartment so we went over to I think 79th and the Hudson River. And it was a nice apartment. It was really neat and it looked rich and she and her girlfriend said their most treasured possession was a Warhol over their bed and we went to look at it and it was so sad because it was a fake. And I knew it and Brigid knew it and Victor knew it. She said it was part of her ""divorce settlement"" from Toni. Should I tell her? It was so sick."
"Friday, April 24, 1981","[Donald Trump, Marc Balet]",0.047129629629629625,Passed out Interviews this morning. Had to meet Donald Trump at the office (cab $5.50). Marc Balet had set up this meeting. I keep forgetting that Marc gave up architecture to become an art director but he still builds models at home he told me. he is designing a catalogue for all the stores in the atrium at the Trump Tower and he told Donald Trump that I should do a portrait of the building that would hang over the entrance to the residential part. So they came down to talk about that. Donald Trump is really good-looking. A girl named Evans was with him and another lady. It was so strange these people are so rich. They talked about buying a building yesterday for $500 million or something. They raved about the Balducci's lunch but they just picked at it. I guess because they go around to so many things where there is food. And they did not have drinks they all just had Tabs. he is a butch guy. Nothing was settled but I am going to do some paintings anyway and show them to them.
"Friday, April 25, 1986","[Charlie Sheen, Dolly Fox, Grace Jones, Maria Shriver, Peter Wise]",0.09309523809523809,I talked to Dolly Fox and she said that Charlie Sheen sent her a ticket to go to the Philippines. So that is exciting. I read in the papers that Grace Jones was taking me up to the Shriver-Schwarzenegger wedding in her plane so I guess Grace called her press agent and put that in so I guess that means we are going. And I called her a few times during the day and she would answer the phone and say hello in this low slurred voice and then hang up. she would stayed up all night I guess and was answering the phone in her sleep. Peter Wise agreed to fly up with us-the wedding's right near his house on the Cape and then drive us back to the plane so that'll be good. Went over to Bernsohn's and it was sort of fun. He gave me a bear hug and asked if anybody'd ever given me one and I said no. But I did not tell him I did not want one. Worked on drawings of Maria Shriver to give for a wedding present.
"Friday, April 26, 1985","[Jean Michel Basquiat, Philip Niarchos, Victoria Guinness]",0.0984375,"Worked all afternoon and was going to work until 8:00 but my light burned out on the tracing machine so I had to stop. I called Jean Michel Basquiat to see if he was invited to Schnabel's because then I would pick him up and Shenge answers and I say I want to know if he is invited and Shenge says ""Oh he is invited? that is nice. I will go tell him."" And I am screaming ""No no no!"" It was a birthday dinner for Schnabel's wife Jacqueline. Glued. Cabbed to East 20th Street ($6). And it was great to be back in the old Union Square neighborhood. Philip Niarchos was there and he told me he had a baby. And I would forgotten that he would gotten married and could not really remember to who. But then I remembered it is Victoria Guinness. On the banking side I think. The birthday cake was Italian. Time went fast. Home at 12:15 fell asleep watching TV."
"Friday, April 29, 1983",[],-0.125,Went to Si Newhouse's on 70th off Lexington and everybody from the art past was there- Jasper and Roy and Leo-and it was so nutty I could not take it I got nervous and depressed and left before eating.
"Friday, April 3, 1981","[Patrice Calmette, Sao Schlumberger]",0.29021164021164025,"-Paris Woke up at 12:00 because we were having our lunch with Sao Schlumberger at Maxim's (cab $12). And Sao was sitting there alone she was afraid that we would forgotten about her. She gave us wonderful ties from India. she would just been there with Patrice Calmette. She talked about how she would been ""too open"" with her last friend Naguib so everyone said there was-that she should uh-that the best way is-well I guess I can not remember because nobody knew what the best way is. Then after lunch we decided to go see the Gainsborough show a lot of beautiful people and their dogs. And then we were so close to Givenchy that we all decided to go to Givenchy and Hubert came down in a white smock and showed us around and we had the best time."
"Friday, April 4, 1986","[Elizabeth Saltzman, Kate Harrington]",0.0481000481000481,"Rupert made some printing mistakes. He has a new boyfriend who goes to Princeton and this one looks exactly like him. Exactly. it is so odd. Elizabeth Saltzman invited us to a surprise birthday party for Wilfredo out in Coney Island. She had an All-City cab pick us up. It was kind of exciting out there at this place called Carolina's a Mafia-style place. Spaghetti. Coney Island was closed up and rainy. It was just Wilfredo and Benjamin in drag and Kate Harrington. The Italian owner found out who I was and got autographs. Then the lights went out totally and then they came in with a lighted birthday cake singing ""Happy Birthday"" and these big butch fifty-year-old waiters came in and Wilfredo groaned and resigned himself and braced for it and then we waited and-they went right by us to another table! (laughs) It was so shocking. It was like when you think you are getting an Academy Award and it goes to somebody else. It was worth the whole evening. It was just great. We could not believe it. And then later on they did come for Wilfredo."
"Friday, April 5, 1985","[Doug Cramer, Elizabeth Saltzman, Eric Goode, Jane Holzer, Mark Goodson, Milton Berle]",0.047610389610389596,-Los Angeles-New York So twelve days of bliss at the most beautiful hotel in the world were coming to an end and then they really came to an end when we got the $9500 hotel bill. We had to pay half of it. I think we were charged for service and for Fred's room. But we got lots of portraits. The Spelling wife and Doug Cramer and Lana. So the car came and took us to Regent Air. it is just $100 more than first class. it is $800. There were only fifteen people. And you really feel the turbulence on a small plane. On the 747s you do not feel anything. The only famous person was Mark Goodson. The rest were just grand types-a woman who looked like Milton Berle and a guy with gold chains so he must have been a Hollywood writer or something (tip $50). they would showed two movies in succession on the flight-Protocol and The Cotton Club-and both of them were not hits but you could see quality in them so it was sad. And the bathrooms on Regent are three times the size of a normal bathroom. And there was a girl with a portfolio either a model or a whore or something just bubbling and enthusiastic. And they come and scramble your eggs right in front of you. When we arrived in New York the airline had twenty limos waiting. Tipped the driver $20. So got in and it was 6:00 in the evening in New York and that really throws you off. I hate it. you are dead tired but you feel like you have to have your day. And you call people up but it is Easter weekend and everybody's out of town. But then the phone rang and it was Cornelia inviting me to dinner at Le Cirque with Jane Holzer. Cornelia is now going out with Eric Goode of Area she says he is trying to break up with Elizabeth Saltzman whose mother runs Saks.
"Friday, April 8, 1977",[Sissy Spacek],0.23174603174603173,Went with Jed to see Sissy Spacek in Carrie (cab $2.50 tickets $3). Loved it. Finally somebody did slow motion right.
"Friday, April 9, 1982","[John Reinhold, Lady Sharon]",-0.203125,It was my last exercise class at Lady Sharon's. I am so mad at her she got us all involved in this and then she just dumps us out on the street and she says it is the people downstairs complaining but I know it is not. If it did not bother them before it is not bothering them now. So I will be doing classes at John Reinhold's for a little while and by then the exercise equipment I ordered should be at the office.
"Friday, August 1, 1980","[Bud Cort, Clint Eastwood, Dennis Christopher, Klinton Spilsbury, Robert Hayes]",0.05211647727272728,"I had an appointment to meet the new Lone Ranger Klinton Spilsbury at the office. Robert Hayes and I were going to interview him. he is on TV tonight and I think I will take a look. He was really good-looking. Long hair 6'5"" and a face that is a cross between Warren Beatty and Clint Eastwood. He had a bottle of wine. He was an art student he said out in California and he was married and had a little baby but his wife-she was rich-she left him he said because he needed too much time (laughs) with his own thoughts. He was making movies directing and then he said he wanted to know how it felt to be an actor so he took acting lessons and then an agent saw him and he went out for a part and they gave him the first one the Lone Ranger. But he did not want to sign at first because it included all the extra things he would have to do like wear the costume and sing things but then they took that stuff out. He said he modeled once that he did not really want to but someone had just asked him to so he did. Then he was really drunk and gave me his belt. Then he started really talking he told me that he would been at Studio 54 and I would gone over and said ""You have to be careful you are dancing with a drag queen."" Klinton said he is a friend of Dennis Christopher's he fell in love with Dennis Christopher and then with that kid Bud Cort who was in Harold and Maude. Then he said he would been picked up by Halston and woke up in bed with Halston. And it was nutty he was telling me all this and blowing his whole image. My ""This Side Up"" dress went for $450 at the auction."
"Friday, August 12, 1983","[Bob Mackie, Jerry Hall]",0.19999999999999998,Jerry Hall came to lunch to interview Bob Mackie for us (cab $6 supplies $102). And I told her that Halston wanted to see her and she said she is always been so nice to him but he is always snubbed her so why is he trying to be nice now. (laughs) She has not figured it out yet.
"Friday, August 15, 1980",[],0.22041666666666665,Got up and passed out Interviews now I carry a lot more with me. I leave them in cabs. And it is so easy to get away from people in the street when they stop you if you give them an Interview. They think they are getting something a drawing or something. Vincent was saying the other day that I should start actually selling them instead of giving them away that it would be more fun for me.
"Friday, August 15, 1986",[],0.3181818181818182,Read the weekend section of The New York Times which had really interesting art stuff in it about a kid who draws dollar bills and pays for meals with it then gets change.
"Friday, August 16, 1985","[Diane Keaton, Emilio Estevez, Matthew Rolston, Steve Rubell, Tom Cruise]",0.1562767556517556,"-Los Angeles It was just the most exciting weekend of my life. Martin went down to the hairdresser earlier in the day to have his hair done. We rode in a limo out to Malibu and when we saw helicopters in the distance we knew we were at the wedding. Somebody had tipped the reporters off about where the wedding was and about ten helicopters were hovering it was like Apocalypse Now. And one helicopter had a girl hanging off with a camera and they were all trying to get in close. And the security people found camouflage-outfitted photographers in the bushes. And I looked really close at Madonna and she is beautiful. And she and Sean are just so in love. She wore white and a black bowler hat I do not know what that was supposed to mean. And someone said that Sean had shot at the helicopters the night before. The only boring celebrity there was Diane Keaton really. And it was the right mixture of nobodies and celebrities. Sean came over to say hello and the good-looking family of Madonna was there all the brothers. And you can see Madonna and Sean love each other so much. Really it was the most exciting thing ever. And at the wedding Steve Rubell was really out of it on I guess Quaaludes. And I think I saw Madonna kick him away from her and later he threw up in the car. She was dancing with the only little boy there. And you could see everybody who was there it was under a tent it was not too crowded. And those young actors seemed like they were in their fathers' suits like Emilio Estevez and Tom Cruise. All those movie-star boys with the strong legs who're 5'10"" or so. I guess that is the new Hollywood look. Like the actors in Matthew Rolston's big photo spread in the Stallone issue. Have I said how great that looked? Matthew is our best photographer now-he uses good locations and gives the kids ""a look."" He made these new kids look stunning-like stars-he gave them all class. Oh and as we were leaving I just could not believe my eyes because Tom Cruise jumped into our car to get away from photographers. His car was down the road. I took a picture of him. Fred and I thought Marisa's wedding was more glamorous but this one was spectacular because of the helicopters."
"Friday, August 17, 1979",[Gore Vidal],-0.056809523809523824,"Went to the Gulf + Western building for a meeting with Paramount Pictures to do the poster artwork for the movie The Serial. I did not realize it was such a big meeting I was fifteen minutes late and there were twenty people there. Fred was there with a hangover really sick so he was no help. The guy-his name was Cohen with a ""K""-Kohen he pointed out the window he had a corner view and said ""you have got to do a good job so I can keep the office."" He kept saying ""I will know it when I see it."" It was so old-fashioned. After we left the meeting Fred and I walked a lot because he felt so sick. We thought that it was not really a good thing to do so he will just tell them a really high price and if they say okay then I will do it. Read in the Post that Truman lost round one of the court battle with Gore Vidal the million-dollar lawsuit. The judge decided not to throw it out of court."
"Friday, August 2, 1985","[Glenn Frey, Mick Jagger, Ron Delsener, Tina Turner]",0.08671875,"The Tina Turner concert was great. I thought she was copying Mick Jagger but then somebody told me she taught him how to dance. And oh what is Ron Delsener's problem? He never got us backstage passes and he is complaining to me about Cornelia wanting free tickets and I felt like saying to him ""Look you want to get into society-well someday she might invite you to that big party you know?"" The wife of Glenn Frey of the Eagles came over to me and Cornelia screamed. ""Get away you groupie!""-so mean and rude. She picked all that up from hanging around with Boy George and Marilyn."
"Friday, August 20, 1982",[Paul Morrissey],0.0,Christopher found a boy named Christopher on Christopher Street who said that Paul Morrissey had also just found him on the street and asked him to be in a movie he was doing in Berlin.
"Friday, August 25, 1978","[Catherine Guinness, Jonathan Lieberson, Steve Aronson]",0.04497354497354497,The main event was Catherine Guinness crying telling me that she was leaving Interview that she got a job at Viva. And she is fat again so she will be leaving as fat as she came. But then I found out she cried for everyone so it was not special that she cried for me. I guess she is maybe scared because she is going to be senior editor over there. It turns out maybe it is the job they offered Bob last year. They came after her and then she went after it. Jonathan Lieberson and Steve Aronson helped her write a paper on how she would change their magazine. Everyone at Interview is so thrilled to see her go. I was surprised-I did not know they felt that way.
"Friday, August 26, 1983",[Jean Michel Basquiat],0.01944444444444443,Cab to meet Jean Michel Basquiat and we worked out ($6). he is going to rent the carriage house we own at 57 Great Jones Street. So Benjamin went over to get a lease and I hope it works out. Jean Michel Basquiat is trying to get on a regular daily painting schedule. If he does not and he can not pay his rent it will be hard to evict him. it is always hard to get people out.
"Friday, August 28, 1981","[Louis B. Mayer, Russell Todd]",0.0689464085297419,"I called Jon fat but I did not really mean it. Paramount was having a screening of Mommie Dearest (cab $6). Ara was there with Russell Todd. So we saw the movie and it was absolutely great. Faye was really good. Really. Oh this movie affected me so much. Movies are really affecting me lately. what is happening to me? And you do root for Joan. Like when Louis B. Mayer just dumps her tells her she is too old and to leave quietly. And then when Pepsi dumps her. Oh gee it was great. I think I identified with Joan is what it is. Okay so then there was a light supper. Then it was early so Jon and I walked up trendy Columbus Avenue and somebody yelled ""Gay boy"" at me and that was funny. Then went home watched TV and took a sleeping pill and woke up at 9:00 feeling so depressed and miserable. Oh God I feel like I did when I first came to New York. I am going through the same things being afraid to live alone and ... oh what should I do? I am down to 115 pounds but that is not the problem it really is not. I look better thin. I guess I should try not to think so much about looks but I am not thinking too much about looks. I never do. I do not. I like ugly people. I do. And anyway ugly people are just as hard to get as pretty people-they do not want you either."

It would be a good building for the magazine though. I walked around looking for other buildings in the neighborhood but they have all gotten eaten up by everybody in the last couple of years everyone's been buying. I called Donald Ambrose Curley's friend who lives in the Gramercy Park area and invited him out to dinner because we need someone to replace David at Interview who quit. Sassy. You never knew what would come out of his mouth. he would been painting the office and he had a friend from Wisconsin Jay Shriver helping him. Jay had just come to New York and was staying with him. So I noticed that Jay was really neat and a good organized worker and I thought that he would be a good person to have working at the office to be like a janitor but we would not call it a janitor and even help me with painting and stuff because Ronnie's gotten too elegant all he does is talk on the phone all day and he is going over to Europe for a show that Lucio's giving him. Anyway so I said to David that we would like to ask his friend Jay to work for us and he got so upset and said how could I even ask that. And then he quit. Cabbed to Trader Vic's ($2). Met Donald Ambrose at the bar (drinks $20). There were a couple of hookers next to us and as we were leaving to go into the dinner place one of them grabbed David. Then Ricky and Cathy Hilton were there and I asked them to sit down but they said no. They were with a girl who was just in from L.A. and she said she knew a friend of mine Ronnie Levin and I told her she should not even know him let alone admit it that it would be trouble and that made her nervous. She had all gold jewelry. She was a funny type like the daughter of some old Hollywood person (dinner $100 plus $5 to headwaiter). The food was just awful.

I was disappointed because it did not seem that thick. Only forty pages of ads the issue was only eighty-eight pages. And Vogue this month is so fat it looks like a telephone book. I had to meet my agent Joan Hyler at Elaine's so I could meet the guy who might get me a guest appearance on The Love Boat (cab $3). Elaine was there looking very slim. It was Joan Hyler Bob Feiden Steven Gaines and this guy Tim from The Love Boat. At the next table was Jerzy Kosinski and his girlfriend Kiki with a Polish kid an assistant cameraman who just defected and he was overwhelmed it was his first day in New York and he was meeting me. Because he would read the Philosophy book in Poland. He had not actually defected yet. You can not defect on a holiday so he had to wait until Tuesday. Then we went to Studio 54 and Mark let us in and I made Curley dance with Tim to show him a good time. We stayed until 5:00 and then I took the kids to a coffee shop and we had tea ($15) and then I got a cab. Steve Rubell was at Studio 54 sober and he said was not it great what Barry was doing and for a second I forgot Barry was doing it for Steve and so I started to say how horrible Barry was but I caught myself. it is Steve's deal with the government-if he gives them names he will get a better deal. So Barry's helping him give names.

He was saying about Bianca ""I will fix her wagon"" and that was scary. So awful.

Wandered around the neighborhood. Called John Reinhold for coffee but he had a lot to do because he was getting ready to go on a trip to Japan. Jon was going to New Hampshire. Ran into Robert Hayes and he said that Greg Gorman the Interview photographer had called and they wanted me over on 18th Street near Fifth to be in a publicity photo with Dustin Hoffman who was in drag filming Tootsie and I thought that sounded like fun. But when I got there they said ""All right we will be shooting your scene soon."" They actually were putting me in the movie. So Greg Gorman was really devious he must have known that for that I would want to get paid. They thought they could just get me in one second which they did. Dustin looked great. When I think of all the lady teachers I had that must have been really drag queens! But then they thought that Dustin should be in a sexier dress to be photographed with me so they wanted to change him and asked me to come back at 3:15. And Ruth Morley was the costume lady. I know her because I worked on a Thurber play that Kaye Ballard was in and I really did the costumes but Ruth got credit because of the union. In 1954 or '55.1 guess I was exploited. And it was a rich-bitch producer and you really do see people carry on and cry because the show is not going right. So went back to the office and there were little packages around and they kept calling me from the Tootsie set. Took Susan Pile over there with me she was in town from L.A. It was my birthday and I was trying to be in a good mood but I was a grouch. When we got back to the set Dustin was wearing something more gay. And it was going to be Dustin's birthday on the eighth and I told him that was mine too. (laughs) Met Dustin's new wife very pretty who looks like Debra Winger. So many of these girls now do. But the baby looks like one of those babies Barbra Streisand would have with Elliott Gould. Walked on Columbus and Central Park West and saw Ron Galella shooting on Central Park West and it turned out to be in front of Linda Stein's where she was having a party for Elton John after his Madison Square Garden first-night concert. Called her up ($.20) and she was not back yet so went over to Jon's and called again and she said to come just not to bring too many people. It turned out to be 100 Zoli models. that is what Elton had asked Linda to get and she did. Timothy Hutton was there with Jennifer Grey."

Victor's told him about my system how I drop everything people give me or that I get in the mail into a box at the office. Victor used to bring me some of Halston's notes like from Jackie O. but then Halston realized he should start saving them himself. These ladies really do write notes-when do they find time? And I am invited to Jackie O.'s Christmas party again. We must be on somebody else's list though not hers. Because we were not invited to the party Jackie gave last week. Robert Kennedy Jr. told Fred that they had a big question about whether to invite us and decided not to. Jackie really is awful I guess. She invited Jann Wenner and Clay Felker. Them she invited."

And she was making wreaths out of holly and I thought fine okay that she was doing it for her house but then she started putting them up on the wall and I started to scream to get them down because the office is not supposed to have Christmas spirit so she got it twice in one day.

Sharon's in England now but when I rode down in the elevator with her the other day she did not seem happy. Or maybe she wanted me to go out with her more. I do not know. she is putting on weight. Fred was invited to Mrs. Marcos's house on 66th between Madison and Fifth the one she bought five years ago. she is in town now giving lots of parties in it. it is on my street and we got there and it is a house twice the size of mine and she had a Christmas tree on every floor and a disco on the top floor but there was no central heat so they had to put heaters in every socket. And that is when I remembered that I would actually been getting the Marcoses' Con Ed bills at my house with a notice saying they were going to turn off the electricity if they did not pay the bill. it is something about the way the address was written it would always come to me at 57 East 66th and I opened them. The maid gave me a tour and it was funny security people and people in furs huddling around the heaters. Such rich people. Such grand people. All in New York. What does it mean? it is scary. it is really scary. Maybe they are here because it is Christmas but oh it is scary. The Cristina Ford lady was there so grand and Imelda was dancing with Van Cliburn.

It was ""Stevie has to eat he needs his nourishment."" Does that mean Dr. Giller whispered in Halston's ear ""Stevie needs nourishment?"" Who starts these things? So Halston was cooking short-order himself. Steak french fries and salad. It was the first time I have ever seen everybody at Halston's eat. he is had so many dinners where nobody eats anything but this time everybody was eating because (laughs) ""Stevie"" needed his nourishment. [NOTE: After the bust at Studio 54 Andy began referring to Rubell as Steve not Stevie.] This was about 9:30. And it was just family so Bianca was not allowed to invite her new Martha Graham dancer-boyfriend. Steve told us all about the bust. He told eighteen different stories. he is not going to have Roy Cohn be the lawyer because he is too conspicuous. They did not go there to arrest anybody just thirty-six IRS guys with guns to seize the books but when they found the coke on Ian they arrested him.

A beautiful Redcap girl carried our heavy bags (tip $10). Got to Jed's house at 7:40. The altitude really got to me I got terrible chest pains. I think it is because of when I was shot. It was not bad in Denver because Denver's lower and when I was in Mexico City once I felt it but not this bad. The whole house looks like a big sauna. This is the house Jed bought with Peter and Sandy Brant. it is by Venturi. it is all wood and simple and clean. The second floor is bedrooms. The kitchen is on the third floor the living room on the fourth. The furniture is all Stickley. We walked into town to the Left Bank restaurant (drinks $30 dinner $200). Fran and Ray Stark were there and Bob knows they are Republican so he told Kennedy jokes and he invited them over for cocktails Monday. Ray's high on Paul Morrissey Paul's writing a script for him.

And she said ""I want to hide."" It was peculiar. She kept saying that the evening was so ""morbid"" because all the Iranians were looking for new jobs. Bob dropped me home.

Halston gave me-maybe-two Elsa Peretti candlesticks from Tiffany but I had to sign a note saying that I would return them to Halston if it turned out that he could not get another pair for himself. So that is a new one. And I was a wreck trying to figure out what size paintings to give to who. It was harrowing. And Steve Rubell gave me five cassettes. And he kept saying it over and over: ""I gave you five cassettes. is not that just the greatest gift?"" I mean they were just tapes that you can buy like a Michael Jackson tape that cost $3 apiece.

Each card has part of the diamond and when you put the nine together it makes one diamond. it is artistic so if they do not like it ... What I always remember when I think of Tiffany's is how in the fifties I left my drawings there once and somebody stole them.

I walked into Bob's office and he was running around trying to find out if what was burning was one of his machines. Then the secretary came running in and said the building was on fire that we should leave. Bob wanted to take the elevator but I said no to take the stairs. The exit door was locked. Just like in Towering Inferno. But we found another exit that was not locked and went into the staircase. People said the fire was on the thirty-fifth floor. At the twenty-sixth floor more people got on the stairway and on the twenty-fifth more got on and the twenty-fourth and every floor was the same story. So it was getting slower and slower because there were so many people being added. But nobody panicked because we knew the fire was above us. A couple of people almost fainted though. When we reached the bottom there were hundreds of people on the street. Bob Denison and I went over to have our meeting at the Trattoria. And I just could not believe the way I would walked into the building and the elevator people just let me go up there when they already knew there was a fire! They must have known by then! And I could have walked onto the blazing floor. Those elevator people just stand around like morons. The man at the Trattoria came over and said that I always used to come there a lot and what happened to me. I was too nervous to really eat. I just had coffee.

Guest's. he is little. He looks like one of Paloma Picasso's little boyfriends. he is the tin king of Bolivia. I overheard Kitty describing me to somebody and I guess somebody must have talked to her about me because what she was saying was sounding like somebody had told it to her-""he is one of the furthest off-Broadway and a far (laughs) head of his time"" and things like that. Maybe it was Billy Baldwin or somebody like that she got that stuff from. I missed Kitty's regular butler the one that had the fight with Diana Vreeland's maid. He was fired for being too familiar but I really liked him-he is the one who told me to watch those A.E. Coppard stories on channel 13. And after dinner I sat underneath Goya's ""Red Boy."" Kitty has this most famous painting right there in her house it is unbelievable. Kitty's parties used to be the biggest thing in New York with every Hollywood star there and now it was down to just her friends. Aileen Mehle-""Suzy""-did not even RSVP this year. Diane de Beauvau took my hand and we ran into the next room right as midnight was coming on. I sort of wanted to stay and kiss the old bags like I did the year before because actually it was so much fun to do-to kiss ninety-year-old Elsie Woodward and say ""Happy New Year darling."" Then Minnie de Beauvau came in and got Diane and told her she had to go back in and say Happy New Year to their father and stepmother-because she knows where their bread's buttered. And the food at Kitty's-it was the canned frozen stuff again. At first you think that maybe these rich people do not know any better because they have been going to charity dinners all their lives but then they do go to La Grenouille too and that is really good food. So they must notice the difference. And there were six servants serving the canned food. Right after midnight it was everybody grabbing their coats they could not wait to go on to the next party. Fred was really drunk. We got out on the street and he thought he was the ""It Boy""-he gave Minnie his coat-the wind-chill factor was making it around twenty below-and he was just in his top hat kissing everyone on the street. We walked Diane to the Westbury to pick up her boyfriend who'd stayed home to write a script but when we got there he was in the nude waiting to fuck her so we left her there. Went home. Called Brigid. Called PH [see Introduction]. Nobody was home yet. At 6 A.M. Jay Johnson woke me up calling to speak to Jed.

It was all country-western. Five minutes before New Year's we decided Jon and I that we did not want to be in a crowd and so we went right outside not to hear them singing ""Auld Lang Syne.""

And Marina is just like a truck driver she pushes everybody around and if that is what love is I guess that is what love is.

Ran into him later he was with Katy Jones and he was talking about what was wrong with the dogs. they are just really getting old. I told Jed I would give him one of the Dog paintings. Life's so short and a dog's life is even shorter-they will both be going to heaven soon.

Worked till 8:30 then went to Schnabel's at 20th and Park. It was so glamorous the Christmas tree was up. Fred was there in an art mood. Dinner was catered by II Cantinori. The girls were absolutely all wearing the shortest shirts ever and then the Madonna stockings. Marisa Berenson was in a black miniskirt. She has the right body. Those boy asses. And Schnabel's wife too she had one twenty inches above her knee.

He made this point of calling a week in advance to make an appointment to come up and see me and he was supposed to bring one other person. Well it was like old times. Jackie arrived with fifteen people. Two were photographers and he had David Dalton who is writing a book on him and Jackie had no teeth and he is fat and he is on amphetamines again. But he is still so clever. Somebody clever has to do something with him figure out how to use his talent. I thought maybe now that we have Ivan Karp and Truman writing for Interview that we could serialize Jackie's book but I brought them in to see Bob and Bob was so cranky he would been up all night thinking about his liver and he said ""Give the book to one of my assistants."" So we gave it to Brigid and she read it later and called me and said it was sort of boring that it was just tapes and she had no suggestions she was just being negative."

I would invited Catherine and we were picking up Truman too. he is like a different person now he is very distant not friendly. He said he would have something for Interview's April issue. I tried to tape him but he did not have anything to say. it is strange he is like one of those people from outer space-the body snatchers-because it is the same person but it is not the same person. And he is looking older he either gained weight or lost it or something but he is not thinking about the way he looks. I can not figure it out. We got to Diane Von Furstenberg's. Diana Ross was there she looked great. Diana Vreeland was there too and Diana-she is getting too tough to talk to. Richard Gere was there and everyone was talking about the Vincent Canby putdown of American Gigolo in the Times. But he said he was cheered up because there were lines around the block so maybe it will be a hit. Paul Schrader was there and Catherine got a thing for him and stayed after I left but then it turned out she only stayed just a little bit so nothing happened with that. Berry and Tony Perkins were there. Mr. and Mrs. Helen Gurley Brown were there and she got Truman into a corner. He left the party early he said he was (laughs) tired of people telling him their personal lives.

He had a friend with him and Brigid said that he would been making martinis (laughs) the new way with gin scotch and vermouth. He told me he is staying with someone and there is five people in one room and I guess he is sleeping on the floor. I wanted to keep working late so I told him it would be easier if he left with Vincent when Vincent locked the door. I think he got mad at me because he left without finishing his martini."

But by 12:30 it would started (cabs $5 $3 phone $.50). Interview was having a screening of The Lords of Discipline at Paramount and I was afraid we would not be able to get around so I hired a limousine. And then I went into Interview and invited some of the kids to ride up with me and then Fred screamed at me that I had destroyed the office protocol. I keep forgetting that at Interview they have all these levels of who gets invited to what with who based on how important your title is. Like a regular office. And I did not invite Robert Hayes to ride up with me because he was with his sister and his boyfriend Cisco and Cisco has AIDS so I did not want to be that close to him. People in the streets were laughing and throwing snow. The movie was great I enjoyed it so much it is so decadent. There are no girls in it and all these boys fighting. Mitchell Lichtenstein looks great just like his father Roy twenty years ago and I do think David Keith is going to be the new John Wayne.

He was having Jon Gould over there. I worked until 8:00 with Rupert. He dropped me off at Chris's. We talked about different projects and then went to have dinner at the Coach House restaurant. One of the waiters it turns out was the kid who once brought me a drawing of mine he would bought from somebody who got it at auction at Parke Bernet. But when I saw it I knew it was not mine so I would not sign it but I told him that if he came by maybe we could think of something to give him instead. it is a backwards Soup Can and I just do not remember doing it although it really looks like I did it. But I do not remember that kind of paper. And it is backwards so I would have had to photograph it and then trace it and I do not remember doing it. I did not do that many drawings and they were all in such a short time. But I mean if I can not even really remember ... Dinner was good ($300). Then Jon Gould had this friend named Lady McCrady who lives on Park Avenue who is done about twenty children's books and we went to her apartment and she had a lot of friends there from like Boston schools and it was like being in the fifties it was that kind of apartment-all the kids were like ballet dancers and artists and witty like Jonathan Roberts the boy who thought of the idea for The Preppie Handbook. The apartment was painted sky. Jon knows most of these kids from some course in publishing that they give during the summer at Radcliffe. Jon had a job at Rolling Stone before he went to Paramount.

Then the birthday party at Raoul's for Barry Tubbs did not start until 11:00 and what are you supposed to do until then. Called John Reinhold and Wilfredo. John picked me up and we went to Castellano's for dinner ($170). Then we went to Raoul's and Barry had odd people there-like Larry ""Bud"" Melman and Judd Nelson and Lynn Redgrave and Tom Cruise's sister. she is sort of cute.

And Billy Boy came by the store and then Paige came and took us over to the Cafe Condotti for tea. And that was fun. When we sit underneath all my Grape prints it seems like it is our place or something. And meanwhile Jean Michel Basquiat is really unhappy-Shenge is having his one-man show. And I mean he is (laughs) just as good as Jean Michel Basquiat. And Jean Michel Basquiat kicked him out and changed the locks but then finally he let him in to get his paintings.

And one of them is going to marry Bruce Springsteen. And the other one is her blonde girlfriend Dana and she introduced her to Eric Roberts and now Eric Roberts left Sandy Dennis for her. And Gael is upset because one of the Interview editors is leaving for a better job. Jane Sarkin. she is going to Vanity Fair. But Interview has so many people now that I can not even figure out what each one does so to me they are all dispensable. Except for Paige. I really like Paige. And Marc Balet. I would miss Marc-he is talented and he does a lot although he would do even more if he were not so busy with all his freelance stuff the Armani ads and things.

I went up to the decorator's and he has like a private entrance in a big building. it is a beautiful office but it is decorated horribly. He had paintings like I have seen at other people's apartments they are just like scribbles and I do not think he paints them but it is somebody's paintings. I just could not face asking him whose they were. I am going to though. He wears Christopher Street clothes army boots and a leather jacket and chinos and he has a mustache and a beard. He looks like Victor like a Gay Bob doll. Then he took me upstairs to see his partner's apartment and she had a duplex with more scribble paintings. Then we went over to the Sedakas' apartment. The renovation job looks like it is costing $3 or $400000 and they are doing things like moving a door one inch. But they are putting in saunas and things. Cabbed to you.N. Plaza ($3). Truman looked like Dr. Frankenstein had just finished with him. He had scars up and down and across his face. He looked like he had the little screw missing. Then we cabbed over to Dr. Orentreich's office ($4) and we slipped in the back way. It was like sneaking in with Garbo. Okay let me describe Truman's costume: He had a scarf over his head then a funny little hat with folds in it and a babushka and a jacket and a scarf over his mouth and dark glasses and a leather jacket and a coat. I mean with these scarves and funny hats draped all over him he was so conspicuous. Otherwise nobody would have noticed him and he would have been just a strange person with blood leaking down his face. And he decided he wanted more done-he wanted more pain I guess-so he was going to have the fold on the bridge of his nose done too right then. it is an operation that Truman says he invented and that Dr. Orentreich has rehearsed on two women first and now he was ready to give it to Truman. There were eight really beautiful nurses. It was like watching Hugh Hefner and his Bunnies. And they said to Orentreich ""What a great sewer you are doctor."" When he was done tucking Truman's furrow-the furrow had been about a quarter-inch and the scar was about three inches-they glued him up. Truman was awake and he said it did not hurt but I do not see how it could not have. He made an appointment for Monday to take the stitches out. Then we cabbed back to you.N. Plaza and Truman was talking about ""our magazine."" He said that in addition to the big editorial meetings he wanted to have an opinion page and letters-to-the-editor column and now I am just bracing myself for some letter to arrive from his lawyers. He says his next improvement is hair transplants. He said his troubles were all because of John O'Shea and that now he really hates him. But then later Brigid told me that he had her send O'Shea a subscription to Interview."

And he was sweet. he would refused Catherine the autograph in the restaurant the other week but Paul McCartney's picture was in the paper the other day and when she asked him again he drew a mustache on Paul and signed it. Meanwhile Catherine had invited two boys she met in the men's room at Studio 54 to lunch brothers from Washington D.C. who have a rock band called Star they are staying at Bob Feiden of Arista Records' house. And they were whispering to each other saying ""Can you believe this? Liza Minnelli John Lennon-she calls this work?""

Ryan O'Neal was there and Sue Mengers. Ryan was leaning against the Morris Louis and put a big dent in it. He was sour. I had all the Guinness kids with me-Catherine Erskine and Miranda-and it turned out Miranda's twin sister Sabrina had been Tatum's nanny and Ryan's secretary when Ryan was filming Barry Lyndon in England and Ryan hated her so he was taking it out on Miranda and she went to the bathroom to cry. Sabrina is actually a groupie even though she is a Guinness. Sue looked terrible and so did Ryan. They left early because I think they thought ""nobody"" was there. Hollywood people are rotten. They all play these games with their A B and C groups and it is just too stupid. that is why when they come down they really come down.

She just went off to Europe to look for some more posters and things. The gallery had a wonderful exhibition of old movie posters like Garbos from the twenties the huge beautiful posters that were printed in German they are about 8' x 10'-things like the original King Kong and Charlie Chaplin. I always bought the smaller American movie posters and they are just not worth anything. The original Cassandre posters are selling for $35000. Can you believe it? And when I think of how I let them slip through my fingers. A print of one is about $5000 or $10000. Posters. Can you believe it? Had lunch at that place called Three Guys on Madison and 75th and it is a really good sandwich shop a lot of kids came in there must be a school right around there. And there was a girl behind us using ""shit"" and ""fuck"" to her mother and whatever the mother would say to her the kid said ""You are insulting me mother"" and you just wanted to slap her and kick her a few times -a little snot-nose. She was about fourteen and the mother was about thirty-five and her mother was crying. You know when you get your mother and you really put the screws in?

Oh and I forgot to say that Truman called. He said that he was hit by a fat skier when he was walking across a ski slope in Switzerland. He sounded more like his old self. I guess he is in a good mood because Lester gave him $450000 for his thing from Interview ""Hand-Carved Coffins."" We do not get anything out of it though. We went to where Stallone was shooting on First Avenue they had about 300 extras. The movie's called Hawks I think and Martin Poll is the producer he is the one who took Stallone to my Whitney portrait show. Martin and his wife were there. They had huge crowds there. The set decorator came over and said that he would been the set decorator on Bad. We went to a restaurant near there. I guess they sent one person out all morning to look for a quiet place for the director to have lunch. It was Richard and Martin Poll and his wife and Stallone and me. Stallone is so cute so adorable. I guess he is lost sixty pounds. he is sexy. All the stars usually think they should have their portraits done free though. he is intelligent he is taken over directorship of the movie and now he is in trouble because the union has a film of him saying ""Lights action!"" it is going before a board. Stallone was telling stories about how much trouble he is had with the union how there is this little Irish guy that he just wants to beat up so badly. He said he had this one shot all set up everybody was in costume and makeup with blood and everything for a fight scene and it was snowing just perfectly and they said ""Okay stop everybody break for dinner"" and he said he practically got down on his knees pleading ""Please just let us get this one shot please I am a fellow worker please I am Rocky!"" and they would not let him. They broke for dinner and then he had to start all over again. I said to him how could he go and tell the papers the truth-that he was not having an affair with Bianca. I told him he should have said he was that he should have gone for the glamour. He said he and Bianca were ""just breaking each other's balls."" I do not know what that means. He told us that he would gone over to pick her up and she was wheezing and had a cold and she looked so horrible that the romance fell apart right there. But he probably does not like Latin types I think he likes big blondes. His manager loved us because Interview had just done a story on his only other client Ray Sharkey. Then we left (cab $3).

There was a big birthday cake for Roy and Margaret thought it was a cushion and sat on it but she got up quickly and nobody seemed to notice. The cake was about 3' X 4'. With a face like a 1920 cheap pillow you know like they had then for the World's Fair.

During the movie the Exit door opened a few times. After it was over we left and when we got outside I realized that I had not taken my bag so Sam went back in to get it and it was gone. So then we looked everywhere in all the bathrooms and things and in all the trash baskets and we told the people at the theater but it was not anywhere and they do not care. It had bank statements and makeup and an ashtray from a restaurant and receipts. No keys. Three oranges telephone bills my Prudential health insurance cards some money. So we ran around the block checking every trash basket Sam felt terrible and a big truck almost ran into us but missed us and ran into a lamppost. So I went home and I felt violated. They stole the monkey off my back. But it is actually a relief. I have decided I will not replace it. And my brother told me that Victor Bockris has taken out an ad in the Pittsburgh paper about getting people who knew me to talk to him for the book he is writing about me.

When we got to the Lachman apartment I could see that Mrs. Lachman was this French lady who is really so bored with her husband. His daughter from another marriage told her father he should paint so now all he does is stay home and paint all day. He paints one painting each in the style of every artist. And he follows his wife around the house he literally bumps into her when she stops. While we were there one of her friends called her and said she was too tired to go fur-coat shopping.

He also told me that he would sent Bob over to see about the Page Six job at the Post but that they could not believe the expense account he was asking for. I knew these places do not pay much just from the days when I used to work for Harper's Bazaar. I guess you get perks but ten years ago The New York Times sent a letter to all the writers saying that they could accept absolutely nothing for a gift. I guess Diana Vreeland though used to get so much so many shoes and dresses. Went to Calvin's on Central Park West (cab $4). I asked Steve if he would invited Bob Colacello and he said no that since Bob was not working for anyplace why invite him. Calvin had fourteen boys and one girl-Sue Mengers. Barry Diller was there and Sandy Gallin the big agent. It was fun talking to Sue she is such a pig. Then we went in limos to Carnegie Hall. Steve gave us two seats way off separated from the center seats that he had. Joan Rivers came on with her boa and she is funny but I do not know how she can say the things she does and get away with it how she is not sued. Like she said that Richard Simmons is carrying Rex Reed's baby and she says that Christina Onassis looks like an ape and she did a thing about Nancy Reagan picking her nose with a breadstick. But then afterwards everybody was talking like her so I guess she is popular.

In front of us was like a family a mother and then I think a couple of daughters with their boyfriends and they were eating and kissing and feeling up and it was so strange so crude. Then Puerto Ricans came in back of us and their feet were up and they were smoking joints and there were all these big black bruisers lurking everywhere. Then when we left the theater I was nervous because we were on the street where somebody's been throwing rocks off buildings and killing people. We went to Studio 54 where Liz Smith and a Lumet girl were having a birthday party called I think ""15 & 50.""

Rupert offered to pay them off but they would not move. He sold it to Israelis and you can bet they will get them out. Worked all afternoon and then decided to try again to see Outrageous Fortune. Wilfredo came and Len and Sam and we went to Nippon first to discuss Interview articles that they are working on (dinner $175). We could not get into Outrageous Fortune the line was too long and so we went and saw a movie about the KGB an English movie and we all fell asleep it was absolutely boring (tickets $24 popcorn $5). Wilfredo dropped everybody off ($10). And then watched MTV and waited for commercials for our show on Sunday which I finally did see and the show looks like it might be interesting it is on Romance.

Went to the emergency room they were really nice there. One girl was really fun out of Pittsburgh or my grade school or something and then while we were there I got X-rayed and while we were waiting for the X-rays they put you in these little cubicles made of bedspreads and then they wheeled a man in who said ""Am I in heaven?"" and he said he could not feel anything below his neck and they all got scared and they wheeled him under the X-ray machine. And there were all these kids with bones coming out of their legs and it scared me so much. And then it was four of the clock and Jon had to meet someone named Dawn Steel from Paramount Pictures at the United City Bank. Went to Barbi Benton's for dinner and Zev Bufman the Little Foxes producer was there. And Mrs. Bufman who I could see would never let him have an affair with Elizabeth Taylor. Barbi gave us a tour of the house and it is sort of like the Watts Tower all built by hand-the architect would go to the stream and get the marble to build the steps. It was sort of nice but not with the things that Barbi put up."

Bianca was supposed to meet us there but she never came and Mary Richardson had called and I guess was hinting that she wanted me to invite John Samuels but I did not get the hint she should have just said something. It was confusing everyone was playing different games. Then Catherine arrived with our art dealer Heiner Bastion. she would taken him to the tennis matches for me and when they came in I just accidentally said something like she had not had the good seats for him and she was upset and actually cried a little saying ""I took your friend to the matches and now you are ruining his whole evening saying I did not have good seats.""

Afterwards Cal called and said that was the first thing Mr. Traub brought up in the car after they left so that might have blown it but they will give Interview something because they do think it reaches the right people.

Had orange and champagne to drink and a steak sandwich which was horrible ($55). Left for the Ritz Jed and I thought Ann would stay in Fred's room but she did not because he had a small bed.

I could not stand it. And I saw where my painting area will be-it is down there in the dark in the basement. I thought that was just going to be for storage. It looks like something we should not be doing. I mean when I go down to 860 Broadway it is sunny and so bright in the front that you feel good. I may just find another place to paint in. The Great Jones Street building might be good. Or I may move up to the ""Entertainment Area"" on the third floor which is the terrace covered with glass because it is light there. But I do not know what we are doing with all this space! Fred has this huge area and what is he going to do in it? Nobody will ever see anybody anymore. Brigid has this huge entranceway and Vincent has this big area for his TV things. it is fine for Interview to have a lot of space because it makes sense but I do not know why we do not just go into the real estate business and rent most of it out. And I thought we were going to have a huge great elevator but the elevator is 1"" X 1"". I did not want to think about it so I just began screaming at everybody. So I got home and I watched Rebel Without a because and gee it was so strange to see Sal Mineo looking like a baby just a real real baby and James Dean and Dennis Hopper look like grown men. You can not figure out what this young thing is doing with them and yet they are all supposed to be the same age. And James Dean looked so modern-the jeans and the Lacoste shirt and the red windbreaker and leaning over with no underwear showing. And Natalie Wood looked her best in this an American Teenager. And Dennis looked so good. And it was sad. The maid was left over from Imitation of Life and she had the St. Christopher medal and she said ""Why could not he have somebody?"" about poor little Sal Mineo. It was sad. Because James Dean had his head on Natalie's lap and then Sal Mineo came and put his head on James Dean's stomach and then he fell asleep and then James Dean and Natalie tiptoed away because they wanted to go kiss and be romantic and it was sad he did not have anybody."

But then his plane was really late and he did not make it. The movie One from the Heart was boring stinkeroo and Frederic Forrest is one of my favorite actors and he would gained about twenty pounds for the role. It was pretty but looks are not enough it is not going to make it. And I was putting the movie down afterward but then I saw the press coming at me People magazine and Time and so I changed my tune and told them how much I loved it.

Down at the office I looked out the window and for about an hour a black man was trying to get his car unstuck. He went down into the subway and came back with a shovel and he tried to dig himself out and whenever he would get back into the car to try it he would take the shovel inside with him-I guess so it would not get stolen. After an hour a bigger Negro guy with a bigger shovel walked by but he did not help him. McDonald's closed early. Chemical Bank closed at 1:00.

When I first saw her I did not know it was one but it is. And you think with all that money why can not they make it right? Why can not they fix what went wrong? she is pencil-thin and she does not like red lips because she says her jaw is big but she was not much of a problem. Worked all afternoon.

I brought Curley's cute cousin David Laughlin for Jill because I told her that every time we had a date I would bring her another boy that I thought she might like one young and rich and beautiful. Sharon Hammond was there and she was with a guy who lives in the Dakota and he has a bulldog and the bulldog was having puppies and he picked her up and was rushing her to the vet and one puppy dropped out right on the spot where John Lennon had fallen shot and that puppy died.

Then lolas called to say he was coming over and I would never really gotten a good night's sleep. Daniela went out with Chris and Fred and they brought me back drugstore medicines which turned out to be antihistamines which kept me up instead of putting me to sleep so it was a day of horror but it went by fast. Iolas looked all right. And Fred stayed on an extra day to do business with him. Chris came by and ordered soup taking my temperature every minute. It went up and down. He went out and had a good time discoing and I kept taking Valiums and not being able to sleep. My temperature went down. Watched TV and tried to sleep getting ready to get up at 6:00.

Glued myself together. Catherine said we could go to Halston's and go from there. He had a limo. Bianca got a call in the middle of getting ready from some friend of hers who said that on cable channel C they were doing my astrology chart so we turned it on and it was a like a maharajah doing my chart and saying funny things from newspaper clippings and it was so weird. He looked like Jerry Colonna. Or like Gene Shalit but Indian. I did not want to watch it it was too weird. There he was doing my chart with two girls discussing it it was really nutty. Then we went to the Erteguns' and it was great. Mick was there. Jerry's out of town. And it was like he and Bianca were courting. They were together flirting. Bianca was touching him it was exciting. Bianca had called Bob and made him get John Samuels invited for after dinner to get Mick jealous I guess but Mick was being so nice to her that when John Samuels called there she told him he could not come because Mick was there and it would get ""complicated."" Then we went back to Halston's house and Bob threw up in Halston's sink he would had too much to drink. Then Bianca said she would take him home and after an hour she still was not back. So we went out to see where the car was and we could not believe our eyes-the driver was getting out of the back of the limousine and about half a minute later Bianca got out. And she looked dazed. I mean she could have been asleep. But was she giving him a blow job? Was he going down on her? Was he trying to rob her? We did not know. Barbara had said that Bianca probably went to see Mick who'd left before her. But it was too weird. We were stunned. And the driver was not good-looking or anything so we just could not figure it out."

She was pretty. And Jon interviewed Shirley MacLaine for the cover of Interview's Health issue he is transcribing it himself so he can edit it I guess before he gives it in. It was a day of running up and down stairs. I was looking at Fred to see if he still had a hangover to see if he could still do the business. I do not know.

Paul Morrissey called from California and said that Carlo Ponti called him and offered him a script and Paul said-Paul said he said-that he would not do a movie for him until he straightened out the money he owes me over Frankenstein and Dracula. Ponti probably thought he could buy Paul off by offering him a movie. Which I am sure he can. Paul was calling about Bobby De Niro wanting to maybe rent Montauk and Paul was saying to give him a cheap price so he would be sure to take it because it would be great to have him there but I think we should raise the price-we are not making enough renting Montauk to run it.

Or to the lunch they had either. The paintings were wonderful and every one was like $600000. I think Jasper owns most of them just sells one when he has to. Then we left there and went to the South Street Seaport to take pictures there and that was strange because right where Jasper and Bob Rauschenberg and Bob Indiana used to live now there is this whole fake town with 100 million stores.

I followed him into the chic little brick colonial Bank of New York on Madison. At first the guard tried to kick me out but I made it over to Bob. This is Benjamin's bank too which is funny because he has to come up from the dumpy Lower East Side to go to it. So I said ""Oh hi Bob. I was with Diana Ross last night and she took me to see Frank Sinatra and gee I know you have been trying to interview him for so long and last night he said he would probably do it so do you still want to do it?"" I was just trying to bring everything back to a friendly level but Bob was so sour. I guess he does hate ... well so he said ""My agent Mort Janklow would never permit me to do that."" So I said ""Well uh gee okay Bob it is great to see you really great."" So I left the bank feeling so moody. And then to make it worse it was one of those times I tried to give people Interviews and they refused them (cab $4.50 phone $.50). I was then in the neighborhood of Doc Cox and so I stopped in to chit-chat. Rosemary is out for a couple of months he said because she got hepatitis. And did I ever mention that she once told me that a man came in with a vacuum cleaner attached to his cock? that is a good one. So I tried to get Doc Cox to confirm what I would been hearing about Henry Post that he has AIDS and now he is sinking fast. He picked up a virus from his cat. he is in New York Hospital."

Frank Perry was there a little fatter. Oh and John does not use the name Samuels. he is ""John Stockwell"" now-Stockwell's his middle name and that is what he is decided to use for his acting career. It was funny to hear him being introduced to people that way. And I did not recognize that it was John in the new Armani ad. They saw him in Interview and asked him to be in their ad. And Joan told me she had a part for me in The Fan-a walk-on in the party scene. she is a camp. She said she is a good agent because she knows what she wants and makes quick decisions. I guess people really act like what they are-agents act like agents and actors act like actors ... Oh but I guess artists act like artists. I went to Union Square (cab $3). I worked all afternoon with Rupert. Worked till 8:00. It was snowing and it was startling to see snow and it was pretty it was nice sticking."

I invited Curley and Justin and Pecker who got fired as a waiter at Studio 54 for serving drinks in the ladies' room. But since the ladies' room there is always full of men anyway I do not know why they cared. Bianca had tickets for the John Curry ice ballet show at the Minskoff Theater. After the show we went backstage to see John Curry. The dressing rooms at the Minskoff are new and beautiful air-conditioned and everything. Jade was with us. there is something so good-looking about John Curry he is so adorable and when I was leaving he kissed me on the mouth. they are thinking of closing the show because he really hurt himself but they are going to run it for another week.

Edwige was unhappy because she came to New York to see Patti Hansen who would not see her again so at the party Edwige put a four-inch cut in an X on the back of her wrist-later Victor found blood in his apartment.

So Victor invited lots of people for dinner with me. One of them was Peter Keating a top male model. His hair is receding but he did not start to get popular until it started to recede he thinks it is because this way he does not ""pose a threat"" to men. Victor made a chicken. The house was freezing and I was the only one cold because everyone else was taking coke. Halston has a freezer stacked full of vodka so it is like drinking liquid oil. I had about four small glasses. Also there were a couple of John Waters people from Baltimore. The one guy who looked like a heavier John Waters said that he was Divine's roommate. I asked if he and Divine were lovers and he said ""Well after all these years you really fall in love with the mind....""

I told her she and Jamie were dancing so beautifully that I got jealous. When I started to dance with Phyllis I did not know that she can not go backwards so I fell on her and then Jamie fell on her and we were all caught by somebody but it was just too nutty. So I apologized and we all got in the car and went out to Cap Ferrat to see Lynn Wyatt who now has Somerset Maugham's old house the Villa Mauresque that I just read about in the biography and it was just everything I really wanted to see and look at. It took us a while to get there the traffic was bad. Lynn was wearing a dress that was split up the sides and you could see all her breasts and she just had a little bikini on and she looked beautiful she has a great body. I think she was trying to get Jamie excited. And they have sort of the same last name. Everybody thinks it is her son who is having a show there. And then Sandra Hochman walked in and she was just so boring rattling on and on she told me she is had a boyfriend who is just bought an apartment in Monte Carlo. She said he discovered fast food-he owns Tad's Steak Houses-and she told me any time I wanted to give a chic party there she would fix it up for me. I asked Lynn to do an interview for Interview because David Niven and his wife came in and I told David that I would just been reading all about him in the papers because he is been suing David Merrick. He was great-looking he was so thin and his wife was pencil-thin. And Sandra was just yapping away about all her books and she was so pushy we could not understand how she knew Lynn and it turns out she went to Bennington with her. David Niven was so cute he told us good stories and Jamie fell in love with him.

We were supposed to kiss her hand but I refused to kiss her hand and so we shook hands and she did not really like me she just liked Jamie. And then when Grace found out that Phyllis was a big du Pont she was really social climbing so she was really nice. And then we had to go show her the pictures and I was trying to be funny but it just did not go over too well. And we chit-chatted about Cousteau and the fish museum that is up near her palace and Jamie said that his father knew her father they live in New Jersey now they do not live in Philadelphia. And we were talking about I do not know just really boring things she never let her hair down. And I told her that I heard she paints and she said she just does collages she had a big show in France that was a sell-out. And I asked her what else was she doing and finally she told me that she is on the lecture circuit in the United States reading poetry. She does a circuit tour like Truman for a couple of weeks so she brings home the bucks. And finally after forty-five minutes of chitchat she decided to go. And when she left she thought the security guard that has the revolver and watches the paintings for the Coe Kerr Gallery was Freddy Woolworth. So it was really funny she told him she loved the show. Fred and I had to go upstairs because I was doing a portrait. Mrs. Benedetti who thought she looked like Marilyn Monroe. And I made her take off her clothes and put on white makeup. She kept posing like Marilyn with her mouth open and stuff and she was old but she came out really easy I had my contacts in and I could not really see but everything was fine. Went off to a couple of cocktail parties down at the Loews which is a hotel that was decorated by Sharon Hammond's mother Mrs. Long but they have private apartments there too. Douglas Cooper was giving a party and this lady named Madame Plesch-Ettie Plesch-was giving one too and they are not talking to each other so you had to be careful and not say that you went to the other one. Then Regine invited us all down to Jimmy'z and John Larsen was there with his wife and he is that really great guy an old friend of Edie Sedgwick's and mine from years ago and now he is really Jamie's friend. He and Jamie are great dancers. And it was getting late and I was tired. And then Bo Polk arrived and he brought this beautiful girl along with him and then Phyllis saw Jamie dancing cheek-to-cheek with the girl and she went up to them on the dance floor and hit Jamie with her cane. And he got embarrassed because he was really dancing close. I got home and I did not have a key so I had to wake the chambermaid and so she put me in it was about 3:00.

Picked up Bob to go meet Truman and Bob MacBride at La Petite Marmite (cab $3.50). Truman brought another Sunday Times the one coming this week the second part of the article on him but this time it was not the cover-he would said it was going to be but it was not. I had him autograph it and give it to me. He says he is going to give another party for his 540 best friends and it would be in a loft and the women would wear veils. Truman picked up the tab. Cabbed to the office ($3). Susan Blond sent a limo for Truman and me to go to the Palladium to see Rick Derringer and another act. They took us upstairs to a dressing room where we found a bottle of Jack Daniel's and some milk and cookies and Truman fixed himself a Jack Daniel's with milk and this rock and roll manager-type came in the room and started screaming ""Clear the room. Clear the room we have to talk money."" So everybody left but us we did not know where to go and he said to Truman ""did not you hear me say to clear the room?"" And so I said ""But he is Truman Capote"" and Truman said ""But he is Andy Warhol."" And the manager said ""Oh sorry."""

We were nervous about our interview because we had a feeling it would be difficult. Maura had read Stanislavsky. And so we went through Dick Sylbert's sets for Cotton Club which was exciting. And Richard was back in this slum area watching old movies on TV. So what he does is he watches every old movie that has anything to do with what he is doing and copies details the way other actors do things. He actually told us his first movie was Days of Heaven which I know it was not but that is how uncooperative he was he would not give anything. The only interesting thing was telling us that he spent all of the time he was not working in the filthy trenches in Mexico in the hospital hooked up to an IV for dysentery-they would disconnect him so he could go to work and then he would be back. It was the movie with Michael Caine. The Honorary Consul And he liked Maura but she is a friend of Silvinha's so that complicated it.

After work Rupert drove me uptown. Called PH picked her up at 8:30 went over to Caffe Roma. And Paulina's mother did not come because she went out with the Indian road manager. Ric will not be in the same picture with Paulina because he is still married. Ric asked if we wanted to go down to Electric Lady the recording studio on 8th Street. And we walked down Fifth Avenue and it started to rain and everybody was first recognizing Ric- he is 6'4""-and then me so their minds were blown and we did autographs and this is when I realized that my camera was gone. Listened to Ric's album and now I finally understand how they just make your voice up. it is twenty-four tracks. He played the album and you could hear every little thing and you really hear what lots of studio time and work can do for a record although I do not know what it all means-you are not making it a better song just more commercial I guess or ... But every little thing is so clear. Ric said he is been renting the basement there for two years and you know how much it costs to rent studio time! He said he is spent millions. Called the Caffe Roma to see if my camera was there I was in that lost-something mood (phone $.50)."

Took British Airlines it was okay a really big plane jam-packed one of those DC-10s I think. Cabbed from airport to the Savoy ($30). At the airport while waiting for bags we heard the people talking about Martha Graham coming in that she is old and they should send a cart for her. We waited for her a little while but she never arrived. Checked in at the Savoy and Martha arrived with Ron Protas they were coming in from Denmark. Ron is Martha's right-hand lady. So Martha and I stood there talking it was fun she was very tired. Learned Dr. Giller had checked in tried to get him but he was out. Liza and Halston had not arrived yet they were coming in on the Concorde (tip to porter $5 room service $5). Read the Martha Mitchell book slept an hour. The rooms at the Savoy were small and dinky on the courtyard but not really a courtyard. Small. So expensive. Then Nick Scott the good-looking rich English kid who was the butler of Bianca during the period when he thought he would lost all his money invited us to have dinner with him and his wife at the Savoy Grill-he is in the bucks again. Sabrina Guinness was at dinner and she is been going out with Prince Charles a lot and we think she fucked him. Fred met Halston in the lobby so he told him I would call him as soon as I could. We had a really good dinner the Grill was great and Sabrina and I went up to Halston's room and I started taping Liza for her Interview interview. Steve Rubell was there with Randy and they had a bedroom and a sitting room and Halston had an adjoining bedroom with Victor Hugo and the next room was Dr. Giller. He had the prettiest room-it was purple and white overlooking the river and it was fun to see everybody in a new place. Steve wanted to go discoing he was carrying his portable radio around turning it up and down. Victor was changing his clothes putting on different outfits. Bianca was in another room with Peter Sparling the dancer with Martha Graham.

But then afterwards the kids started rioting and if it were not for the police the whole place would have gone crazy. It was 99 percent black. The guy who owns Cafe Central took us out of the park so we came out at the right spot uptown to go to Cafe Central. He had a cane. And when we got there Rob Lowe came and Andrew McCarthy who is also in the movie Class. He gets Jacqueline Bisset. And he is just regular a nice kid. At Cafe Central they are trying to treat people rotten to be like Elaine's. The waitress came to our table and said ""you have got to leave this table it is reserved for Lorna Luft."" And Cornelia just burst out laughing that anyone would ask her to move to make room for Lorna Luft. And it was so stupid because if they would just been nice and said ""Would you mind since there is not so many of you now moving to a smaller table?"" I mean they knew we were leaving anyway because we would said we were going to the 11:00 show of Class which Rob and Andrew had passes for. Maybe this kind of treatment makes some people want to go there but it sure does not make me want to go there (dinner $100 with tip). So then we went over to 66th and Second and Cornelia was chattering away she repeats everything over and over just like her mother she has to keep talking. And Andrew was rolling his eyes. The movie was so great and cute. Afterward I tried to sell Andrew and Rob's autographs in the lobby for a nickel but nobody bought any."

He hates being away from New York and he wanted to get back but it was a horror trip getting up. And the hotel was just so beautiful it had the geraniums in the window and red awnings. And Steve did not want to get up and go either but after a half-hour of coaxing he did get up. We had to sit and eat breakfast but it was torture. Victor had his own room upstairs that he would gotten after having an agitation and he was cranky. Halston really enjoys screaming. When he is paying he gets so grand and yells and tells everybody off about how rotten the service is for what he is paying and when he pays the bill he makes you feel-well he is like me only worse. He tells you how he has to go back to New York to slave so hard so he can make money so you can go on spending it all and oh God!-he makes you feel so funny about it. But then it is just incredible what hotels cost now. Finally Victor and everybody was in the car and we got to the Concorde on time and Steve was not tipping the driver who had not even slept he would been out with us all night so I gave him a fifty. As soon as we got on the plane everyone fell asleep. The stewardess woke Halston up and he screamed at her that she better not wake him up again. I wanted to get the Concorde silverware and I wanted to wake Victor up and ask him to ask for food so I could get more settings-I am working up to a twelve-piece setting-but I did not wake him up so I only got one set. It was an easy flight. Then we went through customs and the customs guy used to be a cabdriver who had me in his cab once so he sailed me right through. Got home and went to the office. Cab fares had gone up ($4). It was a hot day and when I got to the office nobody was doing a thing. Brigid was waiting for the cake lady from New Jersey to deliver a cake for her mother's birthday she was taking it out to the country for her later on.

When we got there Chris and Victor Bockris had their tapes on. Debbie has beautiful eyes. Debbie had worked all day trying to find an interesting place to have dinner and (laughs) she did. We went up to 119th Street and Morningside Drive to that restaurant with the big view. The food was as good as La Cote Basque. I do not know how people up there can afford it though because it is so expensive. Maybe doctors and professors. But first we had drinks at Debbie's. she is gotten really rich from the Vanderbilt jeans ad and they are going to buy a building. Chris wants to rent an apartment on the Lower East Side to give interviews in because they do not want to spoil their low-life image and Debbie will have to give interviews there too. I think he is really going to do it. But if you saw their apartment-and he is saying he does not want people to know how (laughs) well they live. it is so junky. It seems like one room made into eighteen rooms. Maybe it used to be a storage floor. There are at least 100 gold records on the wall I do not know why there is so many-oh maybe duplicates I guess. But there is a good doorman.

Vitas Gerulaitis was there and Janet Jones the actress from Flamingo Kid and American Anthem. No rock people except a Bananarama girl. Annie Leibovitz took pictures but only of the boats. Vincent and Shelly were there. I had to hit a gong and I was terrible. The food was horrible Dorito chips and undercooked hamburgers from the Hard Rock and pork and beans. The MTV boat was the only ugly one-balloons all over it. The other boats were all plain and elegant. We watched the president's speech on two TVs. At 7:30 Don Johnson came. A little boat brought him out to the MTV boat and he had fifteen bodyguards and he was in a big fat hat and he would not come on board unless they put steps down. He was with a girl who looked like Patti D'Arbanville-but it was not-holding his baby and then they came on board and went into a room and never came out to talk to anybody. And at 9:45 the fireworks started and we were pretty far away from it. Finally the boat docked and they whisked Don Johnson into a limousine and we looked around and found a couple of gypsy cabs. Oh and the best thing was that when we were getting off the Z Z Tops saw us and took us into the Z Z Top room and that was fun they want to visit us when they come back in August (cab $30).

We walked into the gym and people were looking at us we looked peculiar. Then we went into the room for Tony to massage him and Truman took off his clothes and I (laughs) took pictures. he is fat but he is losing weight. On the way over his pants were falling down like a loose diaper-you could see the crack in his ass. Then after lunch Truman took Bob MacBride who was with us by then and me to his psychiatrist. Truman had told him that I was going to be taping so there (laughs) was Truman on the couch and he was talking about his father and his mother and his stepfather and how his father took his money and all that crap and the psychiatrist was saying all the things that they say in the movies-""Now let us get back to that dream you had."" And Truman got up and looked out the window and then at us and he had tears in his eyes he was sort of crying and then when he was finished he bounced up and said ""was not that wonderful acting?"" Then they were going home for ""a little nap"" and I finally realized that ""a little nap"" must mean sex with Bob-they must do it every afternoon and I guess I have been interfering-but I think Bob likes it better that I am it gives him an excuse not to. So we went back to you.N. Plaza. I was outside the door trying to tape Truman in the bathroom pissing but he closed the door. Then Bob said it was time for dinner. It was just like a vacation like being in the country-right after lunch you have dinner. Truman does really eat only one meal a day though I have watched him. Before we left Truman had a stiff vodka. Then we went over to the restaurant across the street called Antolotti's. Bob fell asleep at the table and Truman told him to go home. Truman told me that his fantasy is to make it with the psychiatrist that that would get their relationship to a ""new level""-that then he would be ""in power."" I was going to ask him did not he think it was so old-fashioned to be thinking that way but I did not I will save that for (laughs) another session. He told me that he blew John Huston forty times and then he told me about Humphrey Bogart. He said that Bogart was ""reeeally scared"" of him and that one night he carried Bogart up to bed and tucked him in and said to him ""you have got to let me do it Humphrey."" And (laughs) he said Bogart was really nervous and said ""Okay but do not put it in your mouth."" So then Truman said to him ""Listen Humphrey we went to the same school Trinity and I know you must have done it there."" But I do not think they did both go to Trinity. Truman makes up so much. Then later Truman said they became best friends and he said once they were staying together at somebody like David Selznick's house and Bogart jumped into his bed with a hard-on. But Truman said he told him it was (laughs) just too early in the morning. Oh and he said that John O'Shea stole the whole Answered Prayers novel that that is why it was not done but I think he is making that up too. And he says he does not want to live in the present because his book ends in 1965 and he is trying to finish it. But when could he work? Oh. And what gets him really upset and nervous is anything anal. If I ask him about fist-fucking he gets so upset. He says he does not want to talk about it.

And so I went running back and had to pretend as if I would just been out of it.

And at 2:00 Phyllis Diller arrived. She said that they told her it was a New York Times interview and that they wanted her to wear a bright-colored dress because it would photograph better but she had not known why since the Times was black and white. Tommy Tune arrived and he is all Southern charm he said that he still reads the Philosophy book that it is made him what he is today that he picks it up and rereads it for inspiration and he feels good again. The press was there and they took photographs. And it was embarrassing because I would brought Phyllis a Cow print wrapped in an Interview and she thought the wrapping was the art and she was being so careful with it and she said [imitates] ""Faaabulous."""

He said he would call me and he did not which was mean. I have to pull myself together and go on. I have to get a whole new philosophy. I do not know what to do. I watched Urban Cowboy and John Travolta just dances so beautifully. It was a really good movie. A Paramount movie so that made me think more about Jon and I felt worse. I cried myself to sleep.

Went to 55th and Broadway with John Fairchild Jr. and Belle McIntyre. it is this brand-new roller skating place run by Negroes that nobody knows about yet and it was great. They let us in free and gave us skates which they do not usually do. It was great to skate so much fun. I am going to buy skates today.

And Paige by then was a new person completely recovered from the night before when she had to stand in front of the building for four hours telling people as they a rrived that the art show was cancelled and somebody who was there said that each time Paige would have to say it she would burst out crying all over again. I asked her how she was able to recover so quickly and she said it was part of her job. So that was good. I told her she should put her advertising commission money into a loft and have four or five art shows a year there. I decided to go to the Whitney Tower wedding which was at 5:00 at St. Bart's. Fred was an usher (cab $3.50). The bride looked beautiful. I was sitting next to Charles Evans. Nick Love from L.A. read a good paragraph from the Bible. he is got the style of the thirties which I think will come back sometime for actors. I was not invited to the reception. Had tennis shoes on and walked uptown with Joan Quinn. Called Jean Michel Basquiat but he has not called me back I guess he is slowly breaking away. He used to call me all the time from wherever he was.

So since he was drinking he was bossing me around giving me art ideas which was good. Nobody was around the office to go interview Diahnne Abbott except Catherine Guinness so I went over with her. It was not a good interview I felt bad about it. It degenerated into me interviewing her little girl of around nine from before she married De Niro and I take the blame for the bad interview because she is a friend of Nelson Lyon's so she must be intelligent and I just did not do a good interview. Dropped Catherine ($4). Gave Jed $20 for car expenses and he drove us to Montauk. we are now trying now to rent the place to Francois de Menil or Earl McGrath.

I could not believe it. And Halston's saying ""Listen darling these pilots do not want to die they know what they are doing."" And I said ""I have flown in a lot of planes and I have never seen anything like this."" And finally it got too ridiculous. They could not jump-start it and so we got off. And they (laughs) offered us pretzels and peanuts. They were embarrassed. So then we got another plane (food $5). Then we flew out and the ride was fast and beautiful-the moon was coming up full and we flew over all the big houses. Halston's brother who is the attache in Brussels was there with his wife and kids and stepkids. The kids were wearing Halston's new line from J.C. Penney. I think it is a hit."

Talked to Jon and he was going to stay home after going to the doctor's because he was rundown. I would gotten tickets to the Feld Ballet in the old Elgin Theater which they now call the Joyce Theater. Met Chris and Peter there. Fun costumes and cute kids. There was one all-girl number and one all-boy number sort of like Grease and then one boys and girls together. The West Side Story number with all the boys was done sort of as if they were making out. But dance is so disillusioning for me. If you are over twenty-five you are finished. Because after twenty you lose that sparkle you get too stylized. And there is always a sparkly fifteen-year-old coming along to wash you up. Then we went to Claire's on Seventh Avenue on the West Side it is like one of those new bright California places all latticework and jammed with fairies and Way Bandy came in and he looked like death and he just drank coffee and I told him I still want him to do my makeup when I go out on the town.

He said he was a record engineer and that he lived with a private investigator and that the private investigator makes him get dressed up in drag sometimes for entrapment but that he was sick of it. I got away from him. Then I got a call from Jon and we were supposed to go to a movie but he said he was on the verge of pneumonia so he could not go out so I said I would bring the transcripts of my tapes of Maura Moynihan over for him to work on while he was in bed. we are trying to see how all this dialogue can be turned into a play.

Lally Weymouth came over and she was Kirk's best friend and he was stroking her in the lobby. Bobby Zarem surprised us and forked up for the lunch. Kirk said he wanted to go to Studio 54 that night and asked if we would call and leave his name at the door.

Ronnie and Gigi and Clive Davis and Bob Feiden were there and they wanted to confiscate Catherine's tape recorder at the door but she only gave them the batteries. A girl was on before Lou and then he was late coming out but then he did and I was (laughs) proud of him. For once finally he is himself he is not copying anybody. Finally he is got his own style. Now everything he does works he dances better. Because when John Cale and Lou were the Velvets they really had a style but when Lou went solo he got bad and was copying people like Mick Jagger. But last night he did his song ""I Want to Be Black""-which never was good before but now it is."

We talked to Governor Carey and he liked Catherine. It was wall-to-wall celebrities. Truman was there. Steve Rubell was not so friendly to me he is being cool somehow I think because I am friendly with Henry Post. Walter Cronkite said hello he was cute and he introduced us to his daughter who is an actress. And I met the kids of Mahoney who're good-looking now.

Fred said I would have to go-just the kind of party I hate because they are all like me so similar and so peculiar but they are being so artistic and I am being so commercial that I feel funny. I guess if I thought I were really good I would not feel funny seeing them all. All the artists I have known for years are with their second wives or girlfriends-Claes Oldenburg had a new girlfriend so did Rosenquist. Roy was with Dorothy Ed Ruscha was with Diane Keaton Leo had his ex-wife Ileana Sonnabend there and his wife Toiny and Barbara Jakobson-all the girls fall in love with him for some reason. David Whitney was cute helping. I borrowed film from one of Leo's secretaries. The artists did a ""you sign mine and I will sign yours"" thing and I got a couple of signatures- Claes and then Keith Sonnier who I like. Nancy the checkpayer from Leo's was there. The place is on Jones Street and it reminded me of when I used to live there and my roommate Lila Davies picked up a Chinese guy and brought him home thinking he was nice and he pulled out a knife. Went home slept a little then crawled out of bed to go pick up Andrea Portago to go to the Iranian embassy. Andrea looked lovely she is back to wanting to be a movie star her mind lapses for a while and then she picks it up again. Paulette was there she sold the rights to the novel Remarque wrote about Andrea's father Heaven Has No Favorites-an awful title Paulette said. She got $100000 plus 10 percent of the movie from Paramount. it is called Bobby Deerfield now and stars Al Pacino as Andrea's father Fon de Portago the race-car driver. After dinner Andrea wanted to be taken to Baryshnikov's party at Lester Persky's but as we were leaving Bianca and Francois Catroux came in and said they would just been there and not to go that it was awful so we went back to Nureyev's party and then had to go through the ""you are backs"" for a while. But then Andrea decided Bianca was only telling us that Lester's was bad to stunt her career that it was probably a great party and that Milos Forman would be there so it would be good for her so we went after all. Cab to the Hampshire House ($3). Lester is high up and as we sat there talking the chandelier kept moving a big one. I was nervous about it. Baryshnikov was so sweet. Milos was cute telling me we had the same kind of shoes. Brooke Hayward was there and threw her arms around me and said ""I am so successful I do not know what to do."" I think she is nutty. Lester had works by Rosenquist and Rauschenberg but just one Cow I gave him and a Marilyn. He should have bought my stuff early on. I am trying to get some Dollars on his wall though.

I mean all these years her movies have been doing big business and her exercise video is number one- Vietnam veterans complained but nobody listened. But now with the clothes it is all these protests and they are effective because Saks cancelled. But why have not they been calling theaters all these years and saying ""we will bomb the theater if you show her movie""? So it makes me think it is like one person in the garment business that is gone after her. You know? Because it is all of a sudden and just focused on this one area. And I mean what category do we fall into having her on the Interview cover? Will that be an area that is just fine like her videotapes where she is the ""most respected woman in America""?

She looked so elegant like the Duchess of Windsor with her hair back and dark wraparound glasses and beautiful makeup and Fendi furs and jewelry-an emerald ring with a big ruby in it and Elsa Peretti diamond earrings.

Diana went over and told Barbra off about something. Candy Bergen and Roman Polanski were there. It was a party for Sidney Lumet. He hates me and his wife Gail does not know whether she does or not but she follows what her husband does so she is cold. Sidney runs around kissing everybody and then stops when he gets to me.

Marisa was there with her hubby the gossip was that they would had a big fight and broken up. But the big event of the evening was when the maid came in with extra food and fell completely across the room. Sue looked concerned but I think she was just worried about getting sued. It was just like watching a movie. The food was flying all over everybody. She must have really hurt herself but she got up and pretended nothing had happened. She was around fifty glasses. Then went to Alana Hamilton's party for Mick Flick and she had everybody there. Diana was getting drunker and drunker and Fred too. Valerie Perrine Tony Curtis and Nelson Lyon sober were there.

And Mark took me aside and said ""it is because it reminds her of the concentration camp. She does not want to think of herself as that brown-haired person."" Decided to see The Outsiders which was just opening and I loved it it was like watching Lonesome Cowboys. You can not believe it-young boys with dyed hair reading poetry in the sunset.

The same cute driver. I wish he was a fairy but he is not. he is trying to make all the girls. And they all have Barbie doll bodies! You can not believe them. No hips and big tits. he is just divorced and says he is a ""country boy"" he lives ""in the Valley"" or someplace like that. Jay is his name. The Captain of the Cars. And he sits there and does crossword puzzles all day when he is not driving. And I said ""do not you want to further your career? If you can do crossword puzzles you can direct."" I had to sign autographs for all the girl actresses and dancers. I was finished by 9:30. Marion Ross from Happy Days plays the ex-superstar and she is a little old to play an ex-sixties superstar but I really love her so much. she is a wonderful person and she helps me she has so much love. And when we do a scene together she does great facial things that help me do my lines. And actually though Ultra Violet's probably older than Marion. And then we went over to the Dynasty soundstage and tried to see Catherine Oxenberg but she said she was in an accident and was crying and did not want to see us I do not know. I bet she just had a fight with her boyfriend. Then they took me downtown to do the Diet Coke commercial. And there was a float and about eight ex-Miss Americas or Miss Universes and all the police were lusting after them and I was wearing my Stephen Sprouse jacket. And one of the girls in a bathing suit said that she had been in Walter Steding's group. And I went and waited in my own private mobile trailer and I used the bathroom and that was fun and then I guess the word the crew uses for the actors is ""talent"" and so one girl opened the trailer door and said ""where is the talent?"" and she looked around and did not see any I guess so she left. I do not know I guess she did not recognize me. And we were on a big float with pansies. The girls sat on the pansies and I had to say ""Diet Coke"" and I drank it for the first time. Later went to Wendy Stark's dinner for Sharon Hammond. Dennis Hopper was there very straight. I asked him to reshoot all the photos he took in the sixties and we would run them in Interview. Shoot Peter Fonda again and all those people. would not that be good? And Wendy made curry with her own hands. Nobody ate it except Fred. And they brought out banana-cream cake for Sharon's birthday. In the day we were shopping for a present for her and all I did was get things for myself so I gave her an I.O.you. it is so strange to see Sharon away from New York and Southampton. She was wearing a dress from North Beach Leather it looked like rubber. Oh and Ron Perelman is out here and he said ""I want to have a big talk with you. I want to buy your magazine for my wife. Who do I talk to?"" And I said ""Fred."" For Claudia he wants it."

And Adolfo said that he sees me in church every Sunday that he sits right next to me so I was embarrassed that I have never recognized him. Vic Ramos called and said he wanted to talk about something so he is bringing Matt Dillon over for lunch on Tuesday. So that is something to look forward to that'll be fun seeing Matt again. I am sure he wants us to produce a movie that is got to be it. Because it would not be (laughs)to direct. That would be too easy too good to be true. He asked if Paul was around and I said yes he is around and he said that we would just have this meeting this way and then we could talk to Paul later about this project.

Met Stuart Pivar and Barbara Guggenheim there and the place had sixty lamps it seemed like a lamp store. Stuart loved it though. Why is Stuart looking for other girls with Barbara so in love with him and she is pretty and intelligent and now is even making lots of money? Why? it is crazy. I mean why did he leave his family to just live alone the way he is doing and worry all the time about finding girls to have sex with? And actually I think he is only interested in twelve-year-old girls. I see him looking at them. it is sick. Creepy. I have a feeling he likes to do things like smell dirty underwear though. I just (laughs) have that feeling about him. Barbara likes him because she says it is like not being with anybody that he is just absorbed in his own things. he is really interesting though he knows so much about art and music and history and everything. The food was cold but it came with those covers on it like it was supposed to be hot.

Leo Castelli was there he said that the BMW people were coming out with a new car so they would not be using the design I did because it was done on the old car but that they want me to go to Paris on June twelfth to paint the new one. Peter Brant was there looking happy really happy now that he is gotten rid of all my paintings. And Leo told me that the de Menils had bought all the paintings at the auction-Francois bought the Soup Can for 95 Mrs. de Menil bought the Disaster for 100 and Philippa bought the Funeral for 75. So that was good. And Jed was there. The WASP women all looked so badly dressed. The rooms were so beautiful though beautiful old paintings in them. I sat with Philip and Dorothy Pearlstein and talked about the old days. The Gilmans were there. Left at 1:00.

I saw this big boat on the water that was half painted and it was so pretty and such a nutty boat and it looked like we could have a party on it. Then Peter and Christopher took us around to show us the town. Peter bought chowder at Mildred's Chowder House in Hyannis which they say is the best chowder place in really all of New England.

John Reinhold called him but Robert's mother would not let John talk to him. He still had a temperature. His family's been here for one and a half months. The hospital bill is going to be so big.

($100 cab to Regine's $4). Barbara and Philip were there Regine and her husband. Then Maria Niarchos arrived. Regine was all excited by the success of her punk party the night before said she served chocolate mousse in dog dishes. Got tired of waiting for Bianca so we sat down to dinner around 11:00. Dinner was crayfish goose fruit plates-very good. A beautiful English girl was putting down Maria as ""amoral"" because she was showing off her cleavage where I would signed it. Fred was very drunk and started defending Maria and saying ""What is morality anyway?"" and they fought for the rest of the night. It was so French. At 3 A.M. just when we decided to leave Bianca called and said to please wait for her. She arrived a minute later looking great and the party started all over again.

Then I would promised Jean Michel Basquiat this dinner at Le Cirque. So Benjamin dropped me and I glued and went over there. he would invited Eric Goode and his girlfriend and Clemente and his wife Alba and then when he ordered the most expensive wine they said they were out of it and then when he ordered the next most expensive they were out of it too. I do not think they wanted to give it to us see because it was a free dinner. Sirio's been telling me for years he wanted to give me one so here it was. And they gave all these excuses and apologies and then Jean Michel Basquiat ordered the cheapest wine and that they had. And it was actually good. And the next day when Paige and I went there with Interviews Sirio was still apologizing. But anyway it cost me in tips ($200). Oh and last time I was at Le Cirque there was this model there who said he was a friend of Tom Cashin's and seeing him there with this slightly older man at Le Cirque I mean it really made me decide that you can not go to straight restaurants with just boys it looks too funny. You wonder what they are doing there they are a sore thumb."

Bulgari was saying things like ""Hide the tape"" and ""They will not let you do that if they see that"" and he was acting like ""this is not that kind of a place it is too high-class.""

Christopher picked me up with the same limo service. Craig got out to the airport on his own. Got to the airport around 7:00. Fred's ex-secretary-Vera the richest girl from Portugal-was there with a group of rich Mexicans going to Acapulco. Got the tickets and newspapers for Chris ($7). And I looked at the Daily News and there in Liz Smith's column was the item on what happened to me and it was nice she did it in a nice way. And there was a news story about the hot dog man on 33rd and Park who got attacked by a roving band of kids and his money was stolen and his cart overturned. But the next day he was back on his corner because he had to earn a living even though he had second- and third-degree burns. Got on the plane and went to Detroit. There was a fat girl holding up the America book to show she was our driver. About 200 pounds. Sweet. And Detroit is all sprawled out. It looks like L.A. And everybody working everyplace is black. We went to the top floor of this hotel the dining room overlooking Detroit and had lunch. I had to go to the bathroom and there was a black guy there so friendly it seemed like a sex thing and I left quickly. And then Craig went to the bathroom and did not come back for twenty-five minutes. And then we went to the Detroit Museum and book-signed there. And the guy who gave that Detroit wedding we went to in the sixties came! And he had the advertisement for it and the old Velvet Underground cover signed by all the Velvets except I think Lou. And my signature's changed so much since those days. I would signed it with a ballpoint pen and ... the Mick Jaggers I signed with pencil and then after that I always signed with the felt-tips. Then we went to Bloomington. Sold 400 books and 190 Interviews. Sold everything. Had to leave at 7:30 to get the 8:30 plane. I think people get in line again and become repeaters. And so on the way to the airport after a whole day of nothing but signing the girl who'd been driving the car all day suddenly came up with a stack of books that she wanted autographed! It was like a movie scene really. Got on the plane. It was a clear beautiful night when we got into New York.

Gigi did the makeup so we now have someone making the faces white so the wrinkles do not show and they print up better and make up into better screens and also it seems to the people like you are doing something more special for them. The pictures really do come out better. The Swiss lady did not like her nose which actually was a nice one so it was hard to take a picture that she liked her nose in. Bob Markell from Grosset & Dunlap came to the office. He said the photo book Bob and I are doing should be out by May 31 and then he started talking about me going on TV and I just looked at him and ran out of the room. he would been saying how everyone in Europe loved all these ""intimate pictures"" of the people we know so then I got nervous-(laughs) what if they are intimate?"

Vincent and I went out in the vestibule and heard a little voice calling for help. The fifth floor had called the Tenth Precinct but they should have called the Thirteenth. The Tenth was over on the West Side. When the police arrived the first two were emergency-unit types with ski jackets and baseball hats like SWAT-looking. Then two uniformed cops came. They were doing everything by the emergency regulation rulebook. But one kidded and said ""Do you have any dynamite?"" in a loud voice. One was peeking down into the shaft and the other was holding onto his coattails. Finally from the third floor they lowered a rope ladder down to the car and brought Victor up through the hole in the top. Then afterwards they washed up in the bathroom and one took off his belt and holster and it was lying on the table the gun in the holster while he washed up. They were both 6'5""."

So Stuart picked us up and we went to Murjani's place at you.N. Plaza. And when I walked in I immediately saw this box with a microphone on top and recognized it right away because it was the kind Imelda Marcos took on the Forbes boat and sang with and then Mr. Murjani started playing it and he sang ""Feelings"" with it. it is the box that enhances your voice and you pick from a few songs and then it is a whole orchestra playing behind you. And he has a really good voice it was like that Indian teenage idol from the sixties Sajid Khan or something. and then Stuart did it and it was fun Stuart can make himself sound like any Broadway star. Then Mr. Murjani took us to this place that I guess he goes to regularly to meet girls. It was on 77th and Second I think. And at dinner there was this table of girls next to us and Mr. Murjani and Stuart went over and tried to pick them up. The girls were in their early twenties and they were going on to a party at the Union Club. And Mr. Murjani told Paige that the other night at the dinner that he would invited them to Gael thought it was one of Paige's dinners so she said to him ""Well since we are entertaining you so lavishly with all these dinners how about advertising?"" I do not know about Gael is she stupid or not? But then it was memorable he will always remember it so that is good. The food was just awful-spaghetti-it was uneatable. Katharine Hamnett was working with Vincent till really late on the video but then she came to dinner too and she was sweet. But the odd thing was there was this boy with her who just stood behind her chair and did not eat and there was an empty chair beside her and everything. Finally I said ""Well uh would not he like to sit down?"" And she said ""What? Oh yes sit down."" It was her assistant. He must have been starving. Then Murjani and Stuart dropped me and Paige off and then they went to the Union Club to try to get in and find those girls but then they did not get in because it was black tie and they could not remember what the girls looked like."

I have not swallowed any sperm."" And she knew she would made a mistake. And then I asked her if she was going to have collagen and she said oh no that she was allergic. It was like ""Me take collagen? Are you crazy?"" So she put her foot in it again. And then she said ""Oh and I will give you credit on the line of natural-foods cosmetics that I will be developing.""

It was a post-modern building the kind with the big columns and there was an old-fashioned lady with her hair up at an old-fashioned switchboard. Mr. Black had read Popism the night before he would done his homework and he reminded me of Peter Brant but nicer. He was about thirty-seven and sort of heavy very nice and a nice fortune-they have mines and supermarkets and newspapers. Then I dressed for a dinner Mr. Black and his wife Lisa were giving for me at the museum. And Gaetana Enders's husband Tom who is the Under-secretary of State for Latin American Affairs was going to be there with Gaetana-he used to be the ambassador to Canada and he is 6'6"" and Gaetana's 4'4"". I called the office in New York and I got mad because I was trying to get Jon invited to T.T. Wachtmeister's party for the king of Sweden and they said there was not any more room. We met Gaetana in the lobby at 7:00 and cabbed to the museum. They had a little TV crew there and we were putting down publicity until we found out that Mr. Black owns the TV station. And they had a cardinal there who is just had a stroke so half of him was there only and Mr. Black had him saying grace. Bob was having a good time at this finally. he is been so grouchy lately but the room full of billionaires perked him up. So we are at the dinner and they introduced me to the cardinal and he said ""I hear you have a nephew who is a priest"" and I said ""Oh yes but he just ran away with a Mexican nun."" And when I said that Fred yanked me away and was screaming at me how could I do that to the cardinal when he was half-gone and there were only twenty cardinals in the world and why could not I have just said ""Fine"" and let it go and the cardinal could hear Fred yelling at me and then they took him away and put him in a car and he rolled down the window and said ""Andy Warhol is such an honest person he could have lied to me and said his nephew was fine but instead he told me the truth and I love his art and I know he goes to church every Sunday."" And then I was given a tour of the Gauguin to Moore exhibition. Henry Moore gave this museum all these plastic things nobody knows why he gave them so much. Really impressive. Like forty figures gigantic. I mean my work looks like nothing compared to that stuff. Oh I am getting to hate my-I must be-all I do is tour everybody else works. I have to get back and do something. I might be well-known but I am sure not turning out good work. I am not turning out anything. I did not have that much to drink. Drinking does put on weight and I have got to stop it."

He said he thought he would ""joked with"" the doctor while he was under anesthesia and oh God I can just imagine what he said. Fred really could be bad under those circumstances. And I complained a lot to Fred about my personal life which I should not do. I should just always say everything's cool. He told me that I should not get involved with these kids' personal lives like Sam's and Len's because it is none of my business. And he is right. I was going to scream at Len for not telling me the truth about Sam spending the night a few weeks ago at Jill's boyfriend's apartment-but then it is none of my business. And then I guess Sam got involved with Victor the other night because Victor called and said ""I have someone you know very well here ..."" and I could not imagine and he said ""The blond boy who works for you ... Sam."" And that stunned me."

So everything was coming out right-I mean it was just what a drag queen would say so that was funny. And the guy really liked her and she did not have a clue it was because he thought she was a boy."

I think he became a member. it is $200 a year I think but it has not gone through yet. I am not going to join. I think it stinks joining. And I do not call Sam anymore everything is different now-my eyes are opened. I guess he was taking drugs when he used to lose things. I do not know when it started maybe he always was. Maybe he would always go out after he dropped me off. Looking back now I guess I was not seeing what I did not want to see. Again. Does it ever end? Do you ever get smart?

After telling Bob that he did not do jazz he was doing a jazz number and he was good at that. He could actually be a good song-and-dance man probably like that blond guy who was popular during the war you know Van Johnson. It was raining out. A girl from the Reagan committee came over to Bob and said she would been calling him all day that his interview with Patti Davis the Reagan daughter could happen tomorrow so Bob was thrilled. Patti's the one who lived with the Eagles. Then she came over herself and she was tall and sort of pretty I thought but she was wearing funny clothes a sweater and something. Vincent videotaped her.

So when I got home there was a message from Robert Hayes saying Paige was hysterical because Jean Michel Basquiat had never come in the car to pick her up. So that was mean. And I told her that that is the way life goes and I said we would go out for drinks and I called Sean McKeon to come with us so that I could handle it better. And Sean's had a crush on me for a few years and it is nice to be around someone who likes you. That was him in the sunglasses in People this week. So we went to the Mayfair and had two champagnes and a coffee ($40). And Paige was so upset-here she would just handed Jean Michel Basquiat a $20000 check for selling some of his paintings. She said she would never show or sell his stuff again. I told her I would let her do an exhibit of my work called ""The Worst of Warhol"" where I would just go into my closets and find all the really horrible stuff that had never worked out so then she cheered up a little.

Gael did a really great job pulling it all together and the party was so nice. I sat right where I did on the opening night-right by the front door-and I did not move once. The party took up the whole street-level floor and then they let the public in at 10:00 but they sent them downstairs. And it is the new look in restaurants-going for the sort of phony rich look.

The flesh color was a little off on the walls but it looked all right anyway. They all started to work. The Italian workers had already started hanging the paintings. Doug's assistant Hilary told me the workers were surprised when they saw that my paintings were closeups of naked bodies and I guess they did not think that was good art because they started to make jokes and compare the cocks with their own and they did not do much work. She said that she and Doug had to do most of the work themselves. If Italians laugh at you and lose respect you can not get work out of them-that was the trouble Paul Morrissey had in Rome when he was shooting Frankenstein and Dracula-I guess the crew decided he did not know what he was doing because they would just stand around and sort of snicker. We went back to the hotel to rest. Then went to the show at about 7:30. After an hour or so we went to Florian's for a drink and everyone took photos. Then went to Autillo's apartment on the second floor of a big palazzo on the Grand Canal. The big hall was all set with tables for 100 people. Autillo showed us his collection. He had my Flowers and Jackies and lots of good art. At dinner I was beginning to feel my chair slip out from under me and was holding on to the table when a waiter told me I should change chairs. But I guess he put the bad chair at another table because in a few minutes I heard a crash and saw a white-haired man getting up from the floor. After coffee we drifted around a little and looked at the collection some more. I was getting tired and was ready to go but it was by then pouring rain. Fred was drunk and he was very quiet. We waited downstairs for the boat taxis. They did not come right away so we decided to walk. We held our coats tight around us. Fred slipped once but we got him home all right. Right after I got in bed I felt the entire building move.

Chris sits there with a magnifying glass looking at the eyes of his new boyfriend in the photographs he took. On a contact sheet. Worked on the Andrew Carnegie portrait for Carnegie-Mellon. Jon was going off to Cincinnati to a Ragtime sneak and then to someplace like South Carolina for the same thing. The reopening party at Studio 54 got absolutely no publicity. The Entertainment Tonight people had come but had not seen any celebrities there. But actually there were low-key stars like the B-52s there and-oh did I say that Tony Curtis came up to me and said that his new career was doing collages?
"Friday, September 19, 1986",[],-0.09875,You know I do think I started this whole bluejeans-with-a-tuxedo-jacket thing because years ago after I wore that to a few big events and was photographed all the kids began doing it and they are still doing it. Sam and I had a fight he was mad and not speaking to me. He wants to be a big shot so he gives anybody who wants to show me portfolios appointments with me and then I get stuck looking at them and wasting all this time so Sam can act like he is very important. And the MTV deal-Vincent says it is happening they are sending us contracts this week we will be doing half-hour weekly shows.

They were supposed to be only for Europe-nobody here cares about royalty and it will just be another bad review. And I told Jean Michel Basquiat not to come to this. I asked him if he was mad at me for that review where he got called my mascot and he said no.

I went to Manolo Blahnik's new shoe store on 65th and Madison next to Kron's really beautiful one-of-a-kind shoes. Went to Kron's ($58.68). It was raining so it was just impossible to get a taxi everybody was waiting. But Gene Shalit came along in a car and said he would drop me and I said that it was way way too out of his way and he said that anything I wanted was not too much. His line is that he does not smoke or drink or take drugs-all he does is work. He said he got Meryl Streep for an interview and I asked him what his secret was that we would been trying to get her for our magazine and he said he just got her by working hard. He said he picks up the phone himself that he never has an assistant do it. He dropped me all the way downtown and I worked all afternoon then dropped Rupert off (cab $4). Then I got myself together I was Sharon Hammond's date for a party for Alexis Smith at a restaurant called Dukes before they took The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas on the road. Sat between Mrs. Long and Twyla Tharp and Twyla was saying that she was a has-been that her movie career was over that Lester and Hair ruined it because they did not use enough of her dancing but I do not see how they could have used more. She had her good-looking younger boyfriend who she is been living with for years with her. She tried to pretend that she did not have anything to do with the Judson dancers-the dancers in Judson Church in the Village in the sixties-and when I would mention one of their names she would not really say she knew them she said she was just down in the basement or something but then after she would had a few drinks she began telling things about the dancers that she would pretended she did not know. And her boyfriend had even said to her ""Why are you pretending you had nothing to do with the Judson?"" I guess she was just a dumb dancer who must have picked up what they were doing and just made it somehow. I do not know how. She acts like she feels she is more important than them now. It was fun to talk to her. Geoffrey Holder was there and Geraldine Stutz all the old-timers. It was a nice party. And then we went to New York/New York. Lester Persky was there and he was fun and Jack Martin I always have a great time with Jack Martin he is so much fun. He said that the Marilyn portfolio that I gave Joyce Haber was getting mildewed in her basement and that once he was able to get Rona Barrett to give him the Marilyn poster I would given her by saying ""Oh Rona what do you have that stupid thing for?"" and so she gave it to him. Jack knows about art he has a few things. I gave Joyce the Marilyn portfolio after she wrote that big article on us in the L.A. Times in the late sixties and she would just broken up with her husband Doug Cramer so I thought the portfolio would cheer her up and it was before I knew how much they would be worth. they are so expensive now."
"Friday, September 22, 1978",[Levar Burton],0.0,-Los Angeles Back to Fiorucci. This time it really was opening. There were 3000 kids on the street dressed in every form of punk possible but it is clean-cut Los Angeles punk. And we were pushed through the crowd just like going to Studio 54 on a big night. I went behind a counter where they had 300 copies of Interview and I autographed them all. A star of Roots Levar Burton asked for one. He was covered in sweat from dancing. They turned the whole thing into a discotheque.

I asked her what she was doing in town and she said she would come ""for a funeral"" and I asked who died and she said her stepfather Robert Lowell. he would just come in from Ireland and got a cab at the airport and had a heart attack. He was sixty-one. I guess he was the number-one poet since W.H. Auden died."

It was at their townhouse on Riverview Terrace off Sutton Place outside in the back and she had the whole waterfront lit up. There were crowds of people. About fifty tables with ten people at each table and they were all in costumes of 1890I was the only one in black tie. Ahmet Ertegun was in a fez. Jerry Zipkin had a mustache. I ran into Mrs. Heinz when I got there and told her my date Cornelia had cancelled and she said ""Well in that case you will be sitting next to no one."" And I asked her where Malcolm Forbes was because I had something for him and she said ""Oh just throw it over the wall."" I did not know what to think about that she was just being glib. So I was supposed to be at table 2 which was a good table but when I got there my name was not on any of the cards. I ran into Jeane Kirkpatrick who I have been watching on TV because of the Korean flight 007 Soviet thing and that was exciting. So I would been moved to Table 18 and there was no other person at this huge table except for some artist who was doing work for the Heinzes. It was so strange-there we were alone and all the really important people were up another level. Tom Wolfe was next to a man too. But I mean this artist and I we were down there alone. He was actually cute and fun. I thought he was gay because he was alone but he said they would told him he could not bring a date so his girl did not come. His name was Ned. And so we gave each other the presents we would brought for Mr. Heinz. His is still wrapped-it is a drawing and I have not unwrapped it because it looks so nice wrapped. They had fireworks. And I got drunk. The food was good not the canned stuff. They had 100 waiters great-looking fairies and they could not figure out why we were down there alone at this table. People came and asked us to go up but I did not. Henry Geldzahler was there and he asked but I did not. Then Ned said he had to go to the bathroom and I said if he did I was leaving and he said ""Tough""-he was drunk too. But I did not leave. It was so cold I just lose my thinking when it gets cold. You just sit there like a bump. If all this had happened inside somebody's house I would have gotten up and left right away but I just felt stuck. I just sat there in the cold. And then the artist came back and then I left. Before dessert. It was the strangest thing and my last party at the Heinzes'."

I am the publisher Fred's the president. Oh God. I do not want to think about it. What was Larry Flynt when they arrested him? The publisher? Why do not they arrest the president-or the editor? Bob could just write his ""Out"" column from jail. It would be a new scene for him to cover. And speaking of scenes Steve Aronson read PH's first draft of Popism and said he will edit it for us after all-that it needs work but that it is fascinating because it is a scene that has not been shown yet. Paul Jenkins came to the office. he is a painter who puts paint on canvas and let us it roll and his work is like somebody else's but he does it well. I think he is interested in a portrait. he is with the rich du Pont girl Joanne."

Florida's really changed it is so different down there it is a new world (magazines and newspapers $12). We were picked up by a limousine and taken to Turnberry Isle and traffic was so bad it took us an hour and a half and I had to glue myself for a cocktail party downstairs and I had three portraits to take photos for during cocktail time. They had a big buffet with all the great food and I could not eat anything because I had to talk to all these people who wanted me to sign autographs and I talked to this lady and she wanted her portrait done right then and there so we had to leave and go upstairs and oh she had pearls on that were a knockout really like down to her belly and so beautiful. I just do not remember her name but she is a good friend of Liza's. She asked me if I wanted a blow and I said no she was one of those crazy ladies. So I did her portrait and then the lady who owned the hotel was giving a dinner downstairs very classy. I sat between the hostess and another portrait and had a really great time. After dinner I had to go to the room and do the two other ladies and we had Rupert as a makeup man. The first girl was all pale because she was too elegant to go into the sun and get wrinkles and the other girls were dark and suntanned so it was very hard we had to really redo them without a real makeup person. And so we used a lot of white makeup. And so finally we got them all over by 2:00 A.M. and we all went to bed and I was so exhausted I could not sleep.

Dropped my packages off and got a cab down to the Palladium. They had it all roped off and you needed a ticket (laughs) to get on the sidewalk (cab $8). Our seats were in the balcony. Grace Jones was at my table but of course she was not there yet. Her manager asked me would I accept her award for her if she was not there on time and I said ""No!"" Grace finally appeared just seconds before she had to go up she had a five-foot hat on it hit people two feet in either direction.

As we were walking together someone said ""Look! Living Legends!"" And at the bank Truman was getting $5000 in cash in fifty-dollar bills and the bank guy asked him was he sure he wanted it like that since he would taken out $25000 eight months ago in hundreds and lost it. Truman's checking account had $16000 in it and his savings $11000 and he took $10000 out of the savings to transfer so that made $36000 in his checking. So he does have money the money does come in. And then we walked and it was starting to rain and this girl from Radcliffe came up to us she said she was working on the Brian DePalma movie and that she would be so honored if she could let us use her umbrella so we walked with her for a little while."

And there he was with lipstick on and everything and in the original script it had called the role a drag queen. Then went back on the set and did the scene where I had to walk up to the reception desk with Raymond St. Jacques and my ""entourage"" and then as we are walking off the Love Boat girl asks Raymond St. Jacques ""How does an artist know when a painting is really successful?""

At Xenon Cornelia's brother Alexander came by and so I sat with him and he is really dumb I think. he is in the jewelry department at Sotheby's. I guess he got the job because they thought with his name he could bring in good estates. I asked him about what I was talking to Jed about the other day-how stones can get switched when people take them over in a corner to look at them and he said that now they have a machine they put them under after you are done looking and before you take them to make sure they are the same stone. I hated the awards Meryl Streep was so cornball and I could not stand Gandhi getting everything. I wish I had not put my name as a host on this party though-you just make enemies of people you forget to invite. I got away upstairs and sat with a kid from Germany I would met.

And he goes off to sex parties and comes back satisfied with his pipes cleaned and he is so in love with his lover Peter he is really considerate and when he goes places he can not wait to leave-just like me-and he gets me to go running all over and even though he is now got me carrying his knapsack I do not mind because it is all exciting and he makes me feel young. I have offered Chris a reward-this wristwatch he wants-if he can get Jon Gould to fall for me. it is confusing because Jon tries to keep a straight image he tells me he is not gay that he can not ... but I mean ... Took the Concorde got home at 9 A.M. on the dot. I called Jon Gould and he said he could not talk his tub was overflowing. Cabbed ($4) downtown. Talked to Marc Balet he was at the office he designed the Zoli agency book that I am in-the catalogue of their models. I already got some job offers I am officially a male model now.

And Doria knew where everything was she said ""there is three Secret Service in the front and four in the back."" They walked up the stairs because the elevator was broken. And then I wanted to see Barbara Stanwyck that night at Lincoln Center she was getting the Film Society annual award and so I called Sue Salter the publicist and she was just rotten. She said ""Oh my dear they are all sold out"" and I told her you know ""we have really done so much for you"" and she said she would try to find one ticket but that I would have to pay and that she could get me two tickets but that they would cost $250 so I said ""That'll be just fine."" At least now they can not ask me for any more favors. Maybe the best thing to do is always pay and then they can not ask you for a thing. But last year they gave me free tickets. Jon Gould asked me to pick him up so Chris Makos and I did. We walked over to Alice Tully Hall and there were a lot of empty seats so I was really hating Sue Salter down to my toes.

I am just going to tip a small amount from now on and not even worry about it. I guess I will have to walk to work. Halfway to work. Eventually got to Union Square. We were having lunch for Henry Geldzahler. The eighty Popisms finally arrived from Harcourt Brace in the morning and I gave them out to everybody but I am going to be more stingy with them now with inflation. Henry wanted to take me out to photograph the tree for the city poster but just as we were having lunch it started to rain. Oh and I forgot to say that during lunch Fred came in and told me there was a roommate of Steve Rubell's from prison there who wanted to see me and I said no! I mean why would Fred even come and tell me that? Why would I want to talk to somebody like that? And Fred said that he thought I should see him so I went out there and this absolute creep is saying things like ""Steve says he can not talk on the phone because it is bugged""-like I talk to him anyway right? And he said ""Steve wants an Italian dinner."" So Bob finally said ""Well what are you here for?"" and the guy said he wanted money to buy the Italian food for Steve. So Bob gave him $20 and he said ""that is not enough."" So Henry gave him another $20 and I had to pay them both back later ($40). But he was just shaking us down. And after he left I screamed at Fred for being so stupid he should have just gotten rid of him. I mean Fred must have stayed out all night and not had his brains right or something. Then we went up to Polly Bergen's apartment on Park Avenue (cab $3.50). This was the Academy Awards party. We were just in one TV room and we did not see all the others. Ex-Mayor Wagner and his wife Phyllis who used to be married to Bennett Cerf were there and the Helen Gurley Browns. And Dustin won.

They had a silver room and people passing out LSD and an Edie running around. And Robert Hayes is now in the hospital with pneumonia. But I do not think he has what he is afraid he has. I think he is just run-down and scared because that is what Cisco has. I mean I do not think you can catch it that easily. I did a Dog painting in five minutes at five of 6:00. I had a picture and I used the tracing machine that projects the image onto the wall and I put the paper where the image is and I trace. I drew it first and then I painted it like Jean Michel Basquiat. I think those paintings we are doing together are better when you can not tell who did which parts.

Then I stuck on a black tie with my bluejeans and rushed over to Lee Thaw's. It turned out I was early and then a little later when Bob and Fred came they were making excuses for me that I would be late before they realized that I was already there. This was a dinner for the Van der Kemps from Versailles and the Herrings from Houston were there and Mary McFadden and Tammy Grimes. I made a faux pas and said to Tammy ""you are wearing one of Mary's dresses"" and she said ""No a Fortuny."" I said Mary's name first because the last time I said to someone ""Oh you are wearing a Fortuny"" the person said ""No it was a Mary McFadden."" Then Mary showed me the difference-hers had a machine-stitched hem and the Fortuny's hem was hand-stitched. And then there was a party at Hurrah's for Tom's play so we were going to go there but we stopped at Studio 54 for a minute (cab $3). And when we were there Halston tapped me and said that Liza and Baryshnikov were there and wanted to go right then to see the portrait of Liza. So we went to the Olympic Tower and they loved the paintings. They did look great. Baryshnikov talked about them for hours. And Baryshnikov told me that his mother when he was eight was getting him interested in art and music and makeup and dress designing and he had Harper's Bazaar around and knew about the art director Brodovich.... I do not know what city in Russia it must have been a big one. And I brought up Chrissy Berlin who was the one who actually helped him defect and he said that she was just someone he liked for a minute that he only likes every girl for a minute.

He was the best man she married some rich guy."

Vincent talked to our landlord at 860 and he said the fifth floor that is vacant rents for $7500 a month! We pay about $2300 for our floor so I mean I really should buy a building. We need more room for Interview and rents are ridiculous. And when our lease is up ours'll really go up too. Janet Villella called and said she would pick me up in her limo to go to the ABT opening at Lincoln Center. Suzie Frankfurt called and said that they foreclosed on John Samuels's father's 79th Street house. It was sold on the courthouse steps to the Brazilians. Tried to find my black tie. Janet picked me up at 7:00. The most jolting thing that happened at the ballet was this woman came over and said ""Hi do you know who I am?"" and I said no and she said ""Lila Davies."" I went to school with her at Carnegie Tech and she was one of the people who we all lived together with on 103rd Street in the fifties. She had her eighteen-year-old son with her. They live in Cleveland. And then I felt old because her son looked like she did when I knew her. I felt old and grey and tired and out of it. And I invited her to lunch at the office. And now I have been thinking that all my problems are because I am feeling old. And I am seeing all these young kids just budding. So I have pinpointed the problem. Godunov sprained his back so he was out and Gelsey Kirkland was really good. Then Misha did ""Push Comes to Shove"" and everybody loved that because he is a star. Afterward they were having a free dinner across the way. Sondra and Chris Gilman were there. Anna Sosenko who wrote songs for Hildegarde was there. she is in the autograph business now and when I told her how many Interviews I signed a day she said to stop immediately that my signature will be worthless."

A resume. Iolas was coming to lunch with a couple of clients and we needed a couple of boys to entertain. And I called Curley and he brought his cousin David Laughlin who works at the Coe Kerr Gallery. Iolas arrived and his contact that he never takes out of his eyes got lost in his eye and he had me look for it but I could not see it. Jackie Curtis came in in full drag and pink slippers and kept interrupting me to ask if he was interrupting anything. I told him no because actually he was not. He did not eat anything because he said he was on a diet and had already had a half a pound of ham and three eggs that morning for breakfast. He wanted some Popisms so I gave them to him. He was on his way to a fashion show so he left. But then later he came back again. This time he was interrupting and he was drunk. But Kimiko and John Powers had come by and Kimiko loved Jackie and if you can believe it she did not even realize it was a man. Jackie looked good he is lost weight. He said he wanted to take Brigid's job her typing job and he said he would be very good that he would just type in a corner. But oh he talks right into your face. Jackie had a sequined shirt on and was wearing a bracelet he said I gave him but I do not remember. Then he gave bracelets to Brigid and Kimiko to try to buy their affections.

Paige did not call. Cabbed to 33rd and Fifth ($6) and then the party problems started. I was planning to have a surprise birthday party for Sam but then Paige had already organized one but Paige was not talking to me. I called her at Interview and she said ""I am working I can not talk."" I said ""Paige it is me."" And she said ""Yes well I am very busy."" And so she was mad at me but I knew she was mad at me before we went to Europe because she gave me the camera and now Paige without a camera just is not herself there is no more darting around and being hysterical. And this went on all afternoon and then Jean Michel Basquiat called and came over and Paige came in while we were sitting together and that was tense and then she said that she would set up the dinner for Sam's birthday at Odeon but that she would not be going to it and she left work early. And then somebody at the office talked to Paige and told me what was wrong and we straightened everything out-she was mad that I did not call all the time I was over in Europe since she always calls me when she is on vacation and also because she said I led her on right up until the last minute letting her think I would make it okay with Fred that she could go on the Paris trip and then instead we took Chris. Fred just did not want the extra work-it is so easy to dump Chris at a hotel and with Paige it would have meant finding her a nice hotel and then picking her up and having dinner and seeing advertisers and all that. And Fred was so grouchy on this trip and I told him he was and he said ""I am old enough to be rotten if I want."" And so at the office I talked to the girl from the Schwarzenegger wedding and they will not let me bring somebody so I told them I just could not go alone and so she started giving me my choice of people to go with and she said ""You can go with Grace Jones."" I said ""Grace is not reliable. And if she did go she would bring her own people anyway."" And then they said ""Well Abe Schmuck is coming you can go with him"" and I said ""I do not know Abe Schmuck."" And then they said ""Joanne Schmuck is going"" and I said ""I do not know Joanne Schmuck."" And then they said ""Lady Schmuck is going you can go with her"" and I said ""I do not know Lady Schmuck."" And I mean who are these nobodies? I said ""I guess I can not go."" So I guess I am not going. And Fred said not to try to get him invited since he had not been invited on his own. And Maura Moynihan called and said she had not been invited to the thing but that she was going up anyway to Boston because Kerry Kennedy and Mary Richardson were going to be there. So anyway Paige and I sort of made up and so it was over it was interesting. it is weird that Paige would get so emotional about me. And then I had to be creative to think of birthday presents for Sam during the fight with Paige. I stuck money in that grandmother-type birthday card and I did a canvas that had dollars pasted onto it and then I remembered they even make those sheets of money but this you can just rip money off when you need it like for tips. Went home and Geraldo Rivera was starting to open Al Capone's secret rooms on live TV in Chicago but it was going to go on for two hours. Sam picked me up (cab $10) and we went to the Odeon. And Paige had some advertisers there to do some business and I told her to invite Keith and his new Juan and then Billy Boy had just arrived in town from Dallas and Paige invited him so it was actually fun and not strained. And Keith gave Sam a radio from the Pop Shop which he just opened and Paige gave him a book on the White House and Wilfredo gave him boxer shorts from Armani."

Went over to Sotheby's it is jewelry auctions all week and the place is eight-deep in this category now. It seems like everybody is buying at auction just instead of in the stores. So I guess the stores will be suffering or they already are. But I am sure they send people to buy and bid their category up. And ran into Ivana Trump in the basement looking at the cheap stuff there. Oh! And who should I run into at this jewelry auction but my worker who I can never find Rupert Smith! I said ""So this is where you spend your days."" He was shocked to see me. Oh and gee I saw Lee Radziwill on an old cover of Life and she really was pretty and I could see why Truman wanted her to be an actress."

And we had one last year too. it is really scary. I thought Manhattan was built on the stuff that would not have it. So my face broke out in pimples I was being paid back for not going to church on Easter. And I was supposed to go on Monday but then I went to Seaman Schepps instead. To look at a bracelet. Benjamin and I wandered around in the rain and the Interviews always look so awful when they get wet. I still have a pain in my side and so I have changed my appointments with Dr. Linda Li to Tuesday so I will not have that and shiatsu on the same day and I have not gone to Doc Cox yet about the pain because I am hoping it is a muscle spasm or something but if it is not I am a goner. Cabbed downtown ($7). Called Jean Michel Basquiat and he came up and ordered Chinese food from a place on Sixth Avenue. And then Keith Haring wanted me to go and see his paintings before they got shipped out because he said I influenced him-he is painting on canvas now. So we ate Chinese food and things from Pie in the Sky. Victor called and invited me to a small birthday party for Halston's niece and it is Halston's birthday too. And Robert Hayes is a little better his temperature went down. Dropped Benjamin ($7) went home got dressed then (laughs) crashed a dinner. It was for Shirley MacLaine and I thought I was invited but it turns out I was not. I mean I would had Brigid call and she said ""Cocktails at 7:30 and dinner at 8:30."" So when I got to the Limelight at 9:00 (cab $6) the doorman said ""Oh my you are awfully early are not you?"" And I said ""But I am invited to dinner"" and he said ""Oh oh sorry."" And then we went in and dinner was just starting. The guy said ""Excuse me Mr. Warhol let me just go check something"" and then he came back and said ""Sorry Mr. Warhol yes it will be all right."" So I still did not know I was crashing. But I mean finally I was getting the idea because it was really intimate. Only like thirty people. Bella Abzug was there and later on Iris Love and Liz Smith came in. The theme of the party was ""white"" and Liz was in a white tuxedo and Iris talked to me about the dogs because that is all we have in common and I just had a white turtleneck on but everybody else was in white tuxedos. And the food was really good. Exotic. A vegetable that I never saw before that looked like crinkled-up green beans. And some perfumed lamb that was interesting. And everybody gave speeches. I was the only one who did not give a speech. And her daughter was sort of pretty Shirley's she looks like Penelope Tree sort of and she gave Shirley a kiss on the lips. And Bella got up and made a feminist speech and her husband got up and then a three-tier wedding cake came out and Shirley gave her dramatic speech. And then there was coconut ice cream. And Shirley came around and she patted me on the shoulder like a dog and said ""Hello there Andy."" Then finally it was time for me to leave and go to Halston's. Cabbed up to 63rd Street ($8). Halston's niece is really pretty now. And Halston handed me a piece of paper in the shape of a boat and I was so thrilled I knew it was the rent check for $40000. So that made my evening. And since it was so rainy I did not have any gifts with me so I wrote an I.O.you. to Halston and Victor and the niece. ""I.O.you. One Art."" Liza said that Mark's only doing his artwork now that he is stopped producing plays and now he is just working at his studio on Prince Street. So I guess he must be having an affair down there. She said he is almost ready to have a show. So anyway I went home and I opened up the paper boat and instead of a check it was just nothing-like ""Happy Birthday"" or something. It was not a check and it should have been a check. All done up like a boat. It should have been a check."

Fred ranted and raved at me when I walked in with his teeth showing and everything saying that he could not entertain these people that it was me they were waiting to see. And I said ""Well I was at my doctor's."" Some lady was getting made up for a portrait. she is one of those people plastic surgery could not help because it would not be much different. But she has a nice pretty smile and an open and loving personality. It was a lunch from Cafe Condotti and there was so much of it. I screamed the other day at Valerie from Interview who was dumping into the garbage all these beautiful fresh tomatoes and basil and she said she was doing it because it was 3:00 and nobody had eaten it yet. These kids are so spoiled. Then a TV crew with fifty people came to film me for a one-second thing for Chemical Bank and they set up for so long and I did it. Suren Ermoyan called and asked me to do the cover of Madison Avenue magazine of Ted Turner and I said yes because he gave me one of my first jobs he was the art director at Hearst in the fifties and then Fred screamed at me. I feel bad because I also turned down doing an American flag for them once."

Cornelia and also Jay have told me that they have seen my Diet Coke commercial on TV and that I am in it a lot. Went to the Tuileries and got the big table in the back and then this homely woman came in and a girl came over and said ""You have to be nice to Roxanne"" and it dawned on me that it was Roxanne Pulitzer and that this is really the eighties. I mean after seeing von Bulow having him come over and talk to me the other night and then seeing him on TV crying about going back to the house at the trial and now this one it is too abstract you know-all these courtroom celebrities.

I am never going to let my name be put on a party again because all it does is get you in trouble with the people you forget to invite or who do not get in for some reason. The invitations got all screwed up. I mean a hand-delivered invitation from me to myself arrived at the office in the afternoon. We went upstairs and found Truman sitting on the landing on the couch and we went to see Mick and Jerry and Diana Vreeland with George Trow and Margaret and Tom. Danny Fields was next to me and he had a great idea for a movie like Saturday Night Fever about a boy who is straight but wants to be the best faggot in town because he sees all the fags having such a good time and he thinks it would be more fun. it is the Ronnie Cutrone story. I hated the Awards I hated the whole thing. I hated every nominee and I hated everything that won. I must be really out of it. But nobody good like John Travolta won. I mean Richard Dreyfuss? I mean if he is a sex symbol I do not know what the world is coming to. And there was Vanessa Redgrave doing her same stupid Communist routine up on stage that she did for us at 860 once. And I can not stand Woody Allen movies. I guess that says something. I ran into Jim Andrews of Polaroid. Yul Brynner was there and Eric Clapton and I kept looking for Doc Cox but I did not see him. Bob came and told us that all the people who counted were down in the basement-Halston and Apollonia and Tom Sullivan and Margaret and Barbara Allen with Ryan O'Neal who is in town shooting Oliver's Story with Candice Bergen. I introduced Ryan and Margaret and she seemed interested. I told her that Paris Match wanted her to do photos for them to work for them but she said she did not like Paris Match that it was (laughs) too gossipy. Bob thinks that Stevie threw away the list of old people we gave him to invite because Aileen Mehle-""Suzy""-and Ahmet and Mica had been cold to him and he found out they had not gotten their invitations.

His show at Mary Boone is coming up this weekend and I guess he is nervous. Sent out for lunch ($44.25). And the gossip is that Julian Schnabel left Mary Boone for Pace because they gave him a million up front. And Jay's still in a good mood so he is working hard and looking around for a mover to help us move completely out of 860 and up to the new place. Oh and in Ned Rorem's diary he talks about some girl named Jean Stein being so terribly in love with him. Something like that.

I remembered I had tickets that Susan Blond gave me to the rock kid who ate the heads off bats Ozzy Osbourne but then Thomas Ammann called and invited me to dinner at Mr. Chow's and I gave the tickets away to Agosto. Cabbed to Mr. Chow's ($7). We talked art. Thomas told the story of the Picasso he bought from Paulette Goddard it cost $60000 and he brought it to one of the Picasso kids and they said it was a fake and he said Paulette gave him a hard time that she was ""difficult"" but she did give him his money back. But when you think about it thirty years ago would somebody really be doing a forgery of Picasso? He started to get really really big in 1950. I came to New York in 1949 and Sidney Janis and those galleries were around and the Museum of Modern Art and art became really big and Picasso became the number-one artist. But it is very early to have somebody be doing a forgery so I do not know. Then Thomas had invited Jerry Zipkin and he came by. He puts people down when he is ""on"" though he thinks he has to entertain. I was saying that Holly Solomon and her husband owned the building that Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller lived in and Jerry was putting her down the way she looks the way she dresses. And Jerry said that what a lot of wives do is they tell their boyfriends they want a $150000 pin and the boyfriend gives them the money and then they tell the husband the same thing and he gives the money and then they buy the pin and they pocket the other $150000 and each one thinks they bought it. And also he said that a lot of husbands buy their wives jewelry in the company name so that when they break up the jewelry belongs back to the company. But a lot of wives have copies made and sell the real ones before that."

Had a restless night because I thought I heard Fred slip out. I heard the door shut and the things click that would all mean he had slipped out. But then when I asked him in the morning he said that he had not so I do not know. All I would have had to do was look but I did not. And I get so scared when I am alone someplace and I do not keep people's phone numbers-I should but I do not. But I will from now on. We got to the airport Charles DeGaulle really really fast so we had an hour and a half before the plane. Then there was a black guy in the waiting room and I wondered (laughs) how he could afford to be getting on the Concorde. And then he said to me ""You have not photographed me yet."" But I still did not know who he was. And then suddenly I figured out he was Dizzy Gillespie! he would just been in Africa and he said things were great down there. He was adorable so cute. He said he loved Africa that there was a lot of dirt on the ground that he liked that. He said he would been photographed by a famous photographer once and at first he did not remember who but then I think he said Carl Van Vechten and that made sense because he was in the Somerset Maugham biography I just read and he was jazzy he always had these jazz people. Dizzy said he had a new book out and we said we wanted to interview him so we took his number in New Jersey. Andrew Crispo was also on the plane. he is bought all of somebody's Art Deco collection. He had a Dunand vase with him and he was with a cute boy. did not see Dizzy get off the plane (tips $10). We went through customs easy because the customs guy was really impressed with the picture of us with the pope on the top of the bags. We got out and our car was not there so we jumped in a cab ($.75 toll). All the way in even though it was the middle of the transit strike there was no traffic! The driver kept saying he did not believe it. We sailed right in. But at 89th Street when Fred got out a lady jumped in our cab who did not speak English because there is a rule on that you have to have at least two people in a car during the strike. I saw a cop making a girl with a car give some kid a lift. So everybody's meeting people. It was really a beautiful beautiful day. There were so many people out walking because of the transit strike. Wandered to the office. Brigid and Robyn were there. I worked all afternoon waited for Rupert who did not arrive till 6:30 because he walked. Brigid and I went out passing Interviews. A bag man started screaming that if I would only stand still he could get a picture of me. He was really screaming looking through his bags for his camera. And then I asked him if I could take a picture of him and he said no but I did anyway. He really had a camera with a flash that worked. Maybe he was a playwright or somebody doing an article on what it is like to be a bag man. He was about forty."

Left twenty-five copies of Interview there. I could not have him included in our Health issue because treating with crystals is not legit. Jean Michel Basquiat's still away on his vacation with Eric-from-Area's-sister Jennifer. They went to Hong Kong maybe. I wonder when they are coming back? I mean how long can you suck dick? ...

Iolas was coming. Then it was too light on the top floor to trace then it got dark and rained and then it got light again. Ran into Crazy Matty on 74th Street and he gave me $.25 and he went crazy because (laughs) I took it. Cabbed home ($6) and got off at the corner because I like to walk in from the block but I am not going to do it anymore because out of the shadows jumped Matty he was waiting in a doorway and I could not get in fast enough he caught me. He went away easily but I am not going to risk it anymore. It means that anybody could come after me like that. He said he needs a job. So I went it and I had four Reese's peanut butter cups and a garlic sandwich and I left the TV on and woke up to Sunrise News.

David Whitney had called and said he and Philip Johnson wanted to pick me up but I said I was running late and David said they always went on time. Cabbed there in the rain ($2). The show was great. Marilyn and Ivan Karp were there and Marilyn told me that the psychic she would recommended to Truman who Brigid went to who was in Interview called Marilyn up and asked what about this Fred Hughes who wanted to see him and was he ""Fred Hughes the actor."" She told him that she did not know about any Fred Hughes the actor-that this Fred Hughes worked for Andy Warhol. I guess that is how they find out all about the person in advance so that when the person gets there for the reading they know all about him already. Lily Auchincloss said she would sent Mr. Hoveyda flowers because of what happened to his brother and she asked me if I did anything and I said no because Bob was away and I did not know what to do."

Then Vincent picked me up (cab $6) in black tie and we went over to the New York State Theater for the North American Watch banquet. Mr. Grinberg pushed me into General Haig and he was sweet we talked about his interview in Interview. I was not at ex-President Ford's table but I sat right behind him. I ate because I was down to 121 and I got scared because when I get below 120 I lose my appetite and you are more susceptible to things when you are that thin. Haig made a speech about war and missiles and he is for all that and after just hearing Gordon Liddy last week well I guess you do need that stuff but I do not know what I believe in because fighting's wrong but then if you do not fight ... And Ford made a speech about how he is happy being retired and how he is going to be working for Reagan's reelection and how the economy is better and so people could buy more watches -he just about said that.

He was on the phone with Liz Taylor and she called him an asshole so he called her an asshole and he said that her asshole was bigger than his and that I should take pictures to prove it. It was funny hearing them talk like this that is how they talk to each other. Went to the Olympic Tower to the party. Hope Lange was there with John Springer. And Christopher had just told me that on Live at Five that afternoon Hope Lange was on with Jack Cafferty and she said ""was not it Andy Warhol who once said that everyone would be a celebrity for four minutes?"" And so John Springer brought that up and said that it was actually ten minutes and then Hope laughed and said that TV was making life go by faster anyway. She was kind of great. Sort of matronly-looking now. Lauren Bacall and Harry Guardino were there. Marty Scorsese was there with his wife Isabella Rossellini who is modeling now. I wonder what Julia's doing. How can a Catholic keep getting married? Bobby De Niro came in and I sent Pat Cleveland over because I know he likes black girls but she was drunk and scared him away. At 2:30 I left. I would had champagne and now I have a champagne headache I really hate to drink."
"Monday, August 11, 1980","[Art Garfunkel, David Bailey, Lil Piccard, Nick Roeg, Princess Holstein]",0.013910626410626422,"It was a busy day around the office. Mr. Stern called and said the Flower paintings were dented when they got to Hartz Mountain in New Jersey. Robyn called to find out about it. Worked on paintings and paying bills up front where it is air-conditioned because it was too hot to work in the back. The Princess Holstein hovers around me when I work. I gave her to Ronnie so he could show her how to trace. Robyn decided to ask around about the Holsteins and found out that they have got lots of titles but no money. We put on a TV to watch the convention. I dropped the princess (cab $4.50). She wants to help me with painting instead of work at Interview but I can do it faster without her. All the real American people from the convention are around town and it is sort of exciting. I saw a lot wearing cowboy hats. Went home and glued myself together. Victor said he would meet us at Halston's. I got there and Bianca was asleep under the covers in a white evening dress that I thought was a nightgown. Halston was working late he had to finish the collection for China he is going to China and Japan. I read the papers and ate potato chips. We decided to go to Elaine's. I wanted to get the Blair boy for Bianca but I could not remember his first name or his phone number. Had a table in the back. Elaine's a little heavier now. Bianca waved and Nick Roeg thought she was waving at him and came over. He was drunk and obnoxious-one of those people who scares me because they change in a second. He directed Mick in Performance. He just finished Bad Timing with Art Garfunkel. He was telling Bianca that he would loved her for years and I said ""Why do not you use her in a movie you can get her."" And he screamed ""How dare you how disgraceful of you to say that what bad taste!"" and Bianca was protesting too. She was nice to him though she did not put him down. I guess she does hope she will get work from him. He was hugging and kissing her. He said he loved Bad. And then he told me he saw ""my mother"" on TV in England that stupid David Bailey ""documentary"" about me where Lil Piccard made believe she was my mother and Nick was going on and on about how wonderful she was and how sweet and how great it was to have a mother who loved me so much and he wished his did and I just did not have the heart to tell him that was not my mother. He said it was so touching it had him in tears. He was yapping and driving us crazy. he is fifty-two and he said how handsome he used to be and that look at him now he said it all fell apart just recently. Then he and Victor had words. Victor had his Sony Sound-about on and Nick Roeg said how dare he be so rude and not listen to the conversation. And Victor said listen that it was his table and he could do whatever he wanted that Nick was his guest and how dare he complain when he would barged in where he was not invited and so then when he saw that Victor was intelligent he was hugging him and apologizing."
"Monday, August 12, 1985","[Harry Winston, Ronnie Winston]",0.026259851259851256,"Cornelia looked great last night at the party for the movie Key Exchange. It was at Harry Winston's jewelry store on 5 5th Street and Fifth because his son Ronnie Winston helped produce it I think. Cornelia was in a golden yellow dress and she was wearing her long blonde braid. A few weeks ago she saw somebody with it and she is good that way she finds out right away where they got it and goes the next day and gets it. And the dress was $40 from Bloomingdale's and on her it looked like it cost thousands. Floppy on top and a miniskirt. She was the best-looking girl there. she is got to lose her champagne double chin though that is the only thing. And they were making her feel bad about not being in Hollywood. And she was in a sweet mood last night not being a brat. She was saying that her mother never helps her-that she competes with her and she will not get her on the cover of Town and Country- and I told her that she could get herself on the cover but she should wait until she is selling something or it will be a waste. And I told her not to be hard on her mother I explained to her ""You know when you are old and you do not feel old you want to be in with the new generation and be part of it...."" And she said that she really misses her father because he was the only one who cared about her. So I think she is going to go out to Hollywood for a month and try to get parts."
"Monday, August 13, 1984",[Jane Fonda],0.065625,Jane Fonda called and I took the call and that was dumb because she always wants something. it is funny the way she just calls people and asks them to do things for her. She wants me to go up to Boston with the paintings I did of her which she never even bought-she borrowed one but it is back and the prints were made to sell for her husband's campaign-but he can not be running again can he? That was just last year was not it?
"Monday, August 15, 1983","[Jean Michel Basquiat, Paige Powell, Pia Zadora]",0.225,Cabbed to meet Jean Michel Basquiat at the workout with Lidija he was doing it with us (cab $5). he is in love with Paige Powell. Got a call from Pia Zadora who said she wanted a Dollar Sign and she would take it with her if it fit into her husband's jet so they were measuring it. Oh and one of the Ramones was having brain surgery yesterday because he was kicked in the head on West 10th Street in a fight over some cheap-looking girl.
"Monday, August 16, 1982",[Ken Wahl],0.045312500000000006,"I watched one of the morning shows and they had Ken Wahl on and he is very good-looking but he was smart-alecky and saying all the corny things dumb actors say. Like that he could ""go back to pumping gas."" He said ""Well I am from the Midwest."" But tell me why it is that everybody is so good-looking now. In the fifties there were the really good-looking people and then all the rest who were not. Today everybody is at least attractive. How did it happen? Is it because there is no wars to kill the beauties?"
"Monday, August 17, 1981","[Liza Minnelli, Michael Jackson, Susan Blond]",0.33611111111111114,At 11:30 I had an appointment to see the Con Ed building on 32nd and Madison. it is a beautiful building but buying it would be like buying a beautiful piece of art this beautiful space. And it has a main big T-shaped room that could be a great Interview office but you can not rent anything out. It goes up five floors and there is no heat it is just like one she will but it is so perfectly beautiful. I could put in hot air and toilets and it would be an artist's space. But then I think about the building at 895 Broadway at 20th Street and it is just a normal substantial building and it has five floors all rented and then I would have rent coming in and we could get one of the floors to move out for us. But this Con Ed one was like a fortress and the best thing was eight pay phones in the corner newsstand where you could (laughs) send people to make their calls. Susan Blond called to invite me backstage to see Michael Jackson on Tuesday and Wednesday and she wants me to get Liza Minnelli but I have not been able to. I will try again though. Bed at 12:30. Fell asleep then woke up and had watermelon then went back to sleep.
"Monday, August 18, 1986","[Jean Michel Basquiat, Mary Boone]",0.09,The day started with Jean Michel Basquiat calling from Josie's she is the South African Calvin Klein model. he is not in a gallery now. He left Mary Boone and they are both glad. He wants to be with Leo but I do not think Leo's taking anyone on. Jean Michel Basquiat would just like to have one show there though even though he knows Leo will not sell anything.
"Monday, August 2, 1982","[Barbara Allen, Diane Von Furstenberg, Indira Gandhi, Mark Ginsburg, Mary McFadden, Michaele Vollbracht]",-0.013137788137788141,Mark Ginsburg was bringing Indira Gandhi's daughter down and he was calling and Ina was calling and Bob was calling saying how important this was so I gave up my exercise class and it turned out to just be the daughter-in-law who is Italian she does not even look Indian. Went to 25 East 39th Street to Michaele Vollbracht's (cab $4.50). Ran into Mary McFadden on the way in and I told her she looked beautiful with no makeup and she said she would never worn more. I told her that in that case as one made-up person to another it looked like she did not have any on. Giorgio Sant'Angelo was there. The food looked really chic but I did not have any. Went to Diane Von Furstenberg's party for the launching of her new cosmetics (cab $4). And all the boys at the party were the same ones who had been on Fire Island. It was fun seeing Diane she was hustling perfume. Her clothes are so ugly though they are like plastic or something. And she had all the high-fashion girls there wearing them. Barbara Allen was there and even she looked awful in the clothes. I did get an idea for new decorating though-big boxes of color that you can put in a room and move around and change your decorating color scheme.
"Monday, August 20, 1979",[Barry Friedman],-0.05795454545454545,Cabbed to Irving Place got out at Gramercy Park ($1.50). Saw a squirrel eating a nut. Went to 65 Irving and de Antonio and his wife were already there. We asked him to write for Interview and he is going to find someone to interview. While the lunch was going on the owners of 65 Irving were interviewing for new waiters off in a corner. Left lunch about 4:15 (lunch $67). Ran into Barry Friedman on the street and he gave me the cold shoulder I do not know why. He was with a girl and either he was drugged or wigged-out or gone up in the world I do not know.

He was in Ibiza and now he is in Majorca he is the new darling of the Bruno set. And I am just expecting him one day to come in and say ""I hate all these paintings rip them up"" about the ones we have done together or something. Oh and Keith told me that the name Jean Michel Basquiat used to use SAMO stood for ""Same Old Shit"" and he said that Jean Michel Basquiat was the biggest influence on the new artists. Cabbed to Jams to meet Philip and David and Keith and Juan ($6). The food was so good fish cooked with the right spices coriander or sage-it makes such a difference when you cook right with spices. I tried to get a design out of Philip for a one-room house. They cried poor. I cried poor. Keith cried poor. It was everybody crying poor. So crazy. David had three martinis but was normal somehow. We were there from 7:30 to 10:00. I asked Philip how it was to be in an airplane crash and he said exciting. This was about seven years ago. He was the only one not hurt. They landed in cherry trees (dinner $400). Philip's having dinner at the Newhouses' and Sandy and Peter Brant will be there too and Si Newhouse has the Natalie picture there and we are just hoping he buys it. And with that group there it could go either way. Because Peter and Sandy might just try to sell him one of mine that they have instead. Or else they could want him to pay a lot for the Natalie so that it would make the value of theirs go up. I have another Natalie somewhere but I can not find that Warren. it is missing from the Factory. I mean it must be around somewhere rolled up. And if Newhouse does not buy it I think I should write a letter to Robert Wagner. I think they are bringing his series Hart to Hart back because people have been writing in."
"Monday, August 21, 1978",[Jack Palance],0.0462962962962963,It was such a pretty day. Hot and dry and breezy. Started walking downtown handing out Interviews over on the East Side. Stopped in some shops and bought some ideas for drawings. (Sarsaparilla $49.00) It was Monday so most places were closed. I was looking for plastic fruit that is what I am drawing. Then cabbed to office ($2.50). I was supposed to go out to Montauk on Wednesday to be in Cocaine Cowboys but it is been changed to next week. My role is to play myself inteviewing Jack Palance in the movie.

Walked over to University Place to look for things to paint. Then cabbed to Richard Weisman's with Susan Johnson and Jed ($4.50). Susan needs a new man-the Billy Copley affair did not work out. When we got there everyone was already watching the Wimbledon match between Bjorn Borg and Vitas Gerulaitis. Those last two were not there yet they were having dinner together. The match went on three hours and somewhere in there Vitas came in with a girlfriend but Bjorn had gone home from dinner. The joke is always that Bjorn sleeps for four hours then plays tennis for two and that Vitas plays tennis for two hours then discotheques for four. Now Vitas has just discovered New York/New York. Susan Johnson was hurt all the butch athletes had girls that were tall slender blonde long-haired. she is just cute and little and brown-haired. There was a lot to drink no cocaine. Everyone teased Gerulaitis that he was wearing his gold coke-cutter razorblade around his neck in the match. he is in training now he left early and only ate a plum.

Chris called me and he is accusing me of just dropping him because I do not approve of Brian and I mean I guess that is true but still ... and I do not know what to do about Chris. I mean he can find a new sucker. And anyway he gets paid for his Interview pages every month. Worked till 7:00. Picked up Cornelia at the Waldorf (cab $6). She had a copy of the new Life magazine that has the big spread on her and it all looked so glamorous really kidnappable (tip to doorman $5). Cabbed to the Gulf + Western Building to see Timothy Hutton and Amanda Plummer in Daniel (15). The movie is absorbing. Cornelia got so absorbed. she is strange. I really do not know if she is smart or stupid. it is like it used to be with like Ingrid Superstar. Cornelia just goes in and out and sometimes she is a moron. But oh she got so absorbed in this it was like a history lesson for her and I made a point of quizzing her on it later and she had understood everything. This is about the Rosenbergs but it is fictional so they call them the Isaacsons. And we went to Mortimer's (cab $4) and Fred was there with his English accent really loud so I know he was drunk and I was getting scared because he was table-hopping and I was dreading to think what he was saying at each table.
"Monday, August 23, 1982",[Joe Dallesandro],0.061111111111111116,The Duran Duran kids came by and brought some bigger and taller girlfriends. Tried to stay on a diet but went off it by nighttime. The German kid who had us do the Fassbinder posters came by. It turns out that Paul is not actually taking over any Fassbinder movies it is that this kid hired him to do a movie and it is going to be Paul says about a hustler who hustles in order to buy clothes. But is not that why all hustlers do it? ... No I guess that is not why Joe Dallesandro would do it. I told the guy that Paul was nuts that I have come to the conclusion he really believes all these wild theories he comes up with. No matter who Paul's talking about now he will either tell you they are really a Communist or really in the Mafia. Before it just used to be that they were really a fairy or a lesbian.
"Monday, August 24, 1981",[Debbie Harry],0.12608225108225107,Debbie Harry's Newsweek article came out and it was strange because the article mentioned me about eight times quoting from the Philosophy book and saying that she worked at Max's. And you know Debbie is not really interesting to talk to but her interviews always come out right. it is like they did with me they pick up the right one-liners and the words sound good in print. Debbie and Chris just bought a house on 72nd between Second and Third so they are rolling in bucks. Got two Gentleman's Quarterlys ($5) because my picture was in it as a model in the Barneys ad and I liked it a lot it was exciting to see. Jay's great because he finally knows how to paint like I do so he helps me out of some tight spots. Ronnie always does it so crude. I talked to Jon who I think was avoiding me. I think he wanted to do something else in the night and he did not want to work on the scripts but he said I could pick one of them up later on. Brigid's working on the Maura tapes and she thinks they are interesting but I read them and I do not. I think those kids take a lot of hallucinating drugs-things like acid and magic mushrooms.

Went up to the Winter Garden (cab $4). The photographers and people were there and shoved us around. Mary Tyler Moore walked in right when it was starting. The show was great. Tammy Grimes was really funny as an old star. They had fifty tap dancers for the opening number. It was what shows should be really big. The set changes. Gower Champion was in the hospital they said. The show was really exciting but the most amazing thing in the show was that Carol Cook was finally a star! I could not believe it. Here's someone I met twenty-five years ago from Nathan Gluck and she was saying every minute that she just had to be a star had to be one. And here it is twenty-five years later and she is finally made it. She had the Joan Blondell part. And it was the regular thing-""the show must go on"" thing. And this Carol does what Brigid used to do-she looks in the mirror and she is happy because she sees a pretty face but she never looks below her neck because if she did she would see 500 pounds of fat. Desilu signed her once and she was in some I Love Lucys. she is not so fat now. When the show was over there was all the bravo-ing really a lot. Eighty-five curtain calls. Then there was a hush. And David Merrick came out and put his hand to his forehead and said ""This is a tragic moment. Gower Champion just died."" And nobody knew what to do. The lead girl started crying. She had just moved in with Gower or something. It was like a movie the lead guy was saying ""Pull the curtain get the curtain down!"" And outside Joshua and Nedda Logan were in tears and it was lots of actors acting. Then we ran backstage and they let us in. The lead girl ran out and tears were coming down her face and she said something like ""Go get my dress"" to somebody and ""The show must go on and I have to be a star."" So this was her big moment and she was so upset with Merrick for ruining it. Then we went to Carol Cook's dressing room and Ina started to introduce me and Carol said ""Oh my God! Oh my God! Andy Warhol! I have not seen you in twenty-five years! Remember when you gave me a drawing and I gave you a cat? Oh my God!"" It was such a camp. ""let us get together."" We bought the papers but no reviews of the play were in it ($1). I do not know about this new section that the News is putting in that Clay Felker's editing. I do not think it is going to make it. It looks too much like that Long Island newspaper-Newsday-and I think people do like newspapers like the Post more."
"Monday, August 25, 1986","[John Sex, Martin Burgoyne, Robert Becker]",0.21805555555555556,Martin Burgoyne called and he asked me to do a drawing of him for a benefit to help pay his hospital bills. Gael brought me the Don Johnson Miami/Las Vegas issue which had just come in. It looks sort of exciting and I told her that. Then Fred told me to be sure to tell that to all the Interview kids so as I saw them I did. I even told Robert Becker I liked the art part which I actually did for the first time-it had young stuff in it the clubs and things. Oh and the best quote in the issue was John Sex's-that the Fontainebleau hotel made a big impression on him when he was little so he is been trying to wear the lobby ever since.
"Monday, August 26, 1985",[Linda Evans],-0.19999999999999998,Looked at the TV kiss of Linda Evans and Rock Hudson in the Enquirer. It was so muggy out. I tried to read Final Cut but it was like reading The Wall Street Journal.
"Monday, August 27, 1979",[],0.2196969696969697,There was no lunch on and I was being good and not eating but then Fred wanted to try out the new thing in the McDonald's commercial-the beef and onion sandwich. It tasted like cardboard and it was in pieces like it had already been chewed. The onions were the only good thing they were real. That was strange having real onions and the rest of the stuff phony. The sauce was good but it was really sweet. There was a big thunderstorm in the afternoon.
"Monday, August 28, 1978","[Bob MacBride, Jack Dunphy, Jack Palance]",0.06520454545454546,"-New York-Montauk Went to the dentist. Dr. Lyons gets sort of mad because I keep putting off the X-rays. I told him about the dentist on TV who said it was silly to take X-rays but Dr. Lyons said he did not care that if I wanted him to be my dentist I had to do what he wanted. Oh and Bob MacBride called and said that Truman says he is been cured in Minnesota and that he is coming back this week but I can not see how he will just get out and do the same things. And Brigid and I are thinking all the time that maybe Truman never did write any of his own stuff that maybe he always had some butch guy there to do it. To do rewrites. Because I mean Truman showed me a script he did and it was just awful and when he shows you these things you can not imagine that he could even think they are any good they are so bad. And I mean he went with Jack Dunphy for years and these guys are all supposed to be ""writers"" but you do not really know what they write and now Bob MacBride gets his name on things but he is not good so maybe that is why Truman's work has gotten so ... because he has not done anything in ten years and that is a long time. And I mean the things Truman says are interesting so somebody else could find clever ways to make them good on paper. The car picked me up at 3:50 and Catherine and I rode out to Montauk it was a nice ride. We stopped at Burger King and picked up a couple of steak sandwiches for Mr. Winters ($5). When we got to Montauk I gave Mr. Winters and his wife Millie the sandwiches and a painting I brought him an abstract-it was a Shadow. I also brought some Interviews and I think his wife liked the magazines better than the sandwich and I think Mr. Winters liked the sandwich better than the painting. I thought he could put it away and keep it. I tried to get Mr. Winters to be in the movie but he did not want to be in it. There are so many kids at the place. Twenty were out shooting and there were still so many. Said hello to Winnie Tom's Danish wife who I see is actually beautiful after all. Went over to the yacht club hotel and checked in. Tom brought his Betamax by. Ulli and his wife Sukey came. We had dinner at the yacht club and it was terrible the place was rotten. Jack Palance who is in Tom's movie was staying there at first but he hated it they were so rude. Then at midnight we went to Southampton to one of those beautiful movie houses to see the rushes from the day before and the movie looks sort of good lots of airplane shots and Jack Palance and Tom is sort of good and the band plays in the movie so I guess that is what he is actually making the movie for to introduce his band. They drove me back to the yacht club and I fell asleep with my clothes on."
"Monday, August 29, 1983",[Jean Michel Basquiat],0.05909090909090909,I just stepped in dog shit. In my hall. And I am usually wearing slippers but this time I was not. And usually you can smell it a mile away but it just did not smell so I just finished cleaning it up. And I am all fleabitten. When you know there is fleas you keep feeling them all the time whether they are there or not. So I just took a shower to get the shit off my foot and now I am thinking what disease I can pick up from this whole episode. Jean Michel Basquiat and I went over to Yanna's and we had our nails done. And you know my nails are getting better. The two of us would make a good story for Vogue (pedicures $30). Victor came by with his brother who is so good-looking. And Victor says his brother's cock is so big he used to hit the table with it at breakfast. I guess they were naked at breakfast you know these South Americans. It takes years to get nervous and live in an uptight situation like civilization. But Victor's actually made out better than his brother-his brother still has to work.

I do not know if they saw me coming and then put it on quickly or if it was already on. It was so strange to hear Lou singing those songs and the music still sounds so good. It brought me back. Then they asked me to sign the album. it is still the original cover with the banana that you can peel the skin off. Does MGM keep reissuing it? I never got any money at all from that record."
"Monday, August 31, 1981","[Chris Christoffersen, Jessica Lange, Jim Morrison, John Denver, Kathleen Turner, Lou Adler]",0.1259027777777778,Colorado We called up Jack and he said he would meet us in Aspen so we drove all the way to Aspen and it was just so beautiful and a toy town. We went to this restaurant where Jack met us with Lou Adler and Jack was just adorable. God he just was adorable. The waitresses were adorable everybody was adorable. Bob complained later that Christopher was so pushy but I told him it is good to be pushy because it is the only way to get a good picture and not to worry about it. I told Jack I loved Body Heat. Because he is out here in the sticks and so he does not see anything. I said it was a real hot movie. He kept asking about the girl Kathleen Turner and I said that she would never be remembered. He said she was no Jessica Lange which she really is not. Then we said goodbye to him and went back to the car. We drove to the airport to John Denver's plane but the weather was bad. Then all of a sudden John Denver's father appeared. So we got in this Lear jet and his father flew it and we went up and down and up and down and we arrived in Fort Collins and were met by all these kids and were taken to the motel. We bought a lot of Rolling Stones with Jim Morrison on the cover. he is literally selling more records dead than alive. Had dinner with the president of Colorado State University whose name is Chris Christoffersen spelled with Cs. After dinner he took us to the museum so we could see the show before anybody else did. In front of the museum they have three cans that are about thirty feet high and they look like big sculptures by Oldenburg big handpainted Campbell's Tomato Soup Cans. One of the kids did them I guess. And every room here at the motel is cans with flowers in them and I mean I am so tired of the Campbell's Soup Can I could throw up. But the show's cute it is just in one room and it is all prints and we stayed there about an hour then I got back and I took a Valium and I could not sleep.

The Hare Krishna kid from Max's in the sixties stopped by-the one who was just in Hannah and Her Sisters. he would been to Gimbel's which is going out of business and he said it is such a shame to see a store that is such a tradition go out of business that this great name was going down. But it is just a name. So what. And here's this Hare Krishna saying it it was funny. I guess Macy's will be the only thing happening over on Herald Square. I read Cindy Adams's obituary of Roy Cohn. She said she knew he was dying at that party at the Palladium when they had to help him up to the podium and that when she shook his hand his weight fell on her. Fred's mad because my name is linked with Roy's in all his obituaries as one of his good friends. And Roy's stuff is going to look just like Rock Hudson's at auction. All weird things that you do not know why they would be in a house like things people gave him. His house in town was always just on the verge of being a slum but the one in Greenwich was more decorated more chintzed-up.

We should have had him on Interview's cover. It would have been funny to have a phony baloney interview with him on all the newsstands now-""Why I am Straight"" by Rock Hudson. Gael called and said that Kim Basinger is going to be the cover for November and I said ""Whaaat?"" I mean she is older and she is not going to be anybody and even if she is so what you know? I am just so bored with movie-stars-for-yuppies. I was at Dr. Li's and she told me to give up bananas and wheat and broccoli and hot food. And I want to do a Madonna headline-the Post one: ""MADONNA ON NUDE PIX-'SO WHAT?' ""-and use a photograph of her from a different day that would fit right in but Keith wants to use a photo he took of her and Sean Penn. Which is kind of grey. But I will do it both ways. we are doing a painting together for her wedding present. Walter Stait called and said that Ted Carey had passed on in East Hampton. He was having an opening on Saturday out there of all his paintings. I did not know he lived in Jed's building on West 67th. In Stuart Pivar's building. With this Italian kid. I knew he was about to go Walter had called me last week."
"Monday, August 6, 1979","[Jackie Curtis, Madeline Netter, Mary Woronov, Peter Luger, Suzie Frankfurt]",0.02977092352092352,My birthday. When I got to the office I cut the cake right away so that I would not have to do it in front of everybody. It tasted awful. Brigid ordered it from the woman in New Jersey. I told her to be sure it was a wedding cake. It was three tiers. In the end though it really was not big enough. People came in and out all day and ate the cake. I usually ignore my birthday and order everyone not to mention it but this year I was in a party mood and did not want to fight it. I actually arranged the party myself and invited people over. Jackie Curtis called me on the phone and Mary Woronov. Suzie Frankfurt came down and de Antonio came by he looked a little skinnier. Honey Berlin called and every time she finds out I am a Leo she is surprised. Madeline Netter came by and was sweet and fun and then volunteered to help clean up and then we went over to 65 Irving. Fabrizzi gave us free birthday drinks. And then we cabbed to Brooklyn ($5) and had a steak dinner under the Williamsburg Bridge at Peter Luger's. Got home early.
"Monday, August 6, 1984","[David Whitney, Drue Heinz, Ethel Scull, Fairfield Porter, Ivan Karp, Jean Michel Basquiat, Jean Stein, Kate Harrington, Michael Jackson, Roberta Flack, Sidney Janis]",0.029436813186813193,"The unmentionable day. I would told everyone I did not want to hear the word ""birthday."" Benjamin picked me up and we cabbed to 70th and Broadway ($4). Dr. Li said that she would been at the Michael Jackson thing and I was surprised. Then I put it together-Benjamin had said he saw Roberta Flack at the concert and Dr. Li has a picture of Roberta Flack in her office so I asked her if she was with Roberta Flack and she said yes. So now I am trying to figure out if they could be dykes. Then cabbed to the Whitney where there was the lunch for the presentation by Ethel Scull of the portrait of her that I did in the sixties (cab $4). They were serving lunch in front of the painting. Ethel had not arrived yet and when they called her she was in the bath she thought the lunch was Tuesday. Finally she arrived in a wheelchair and a hat with the big cast on her leg. It was so sad. Like a movie moment where everybody's waiting. The painting's not very good even. It was just-I do not know. And she said all these things about how I would wanted $1200 cash for the painting. In cash she said and I mean I do not remember that-I would not have even discussed money. I can not even do it now so I can not see myself saying ""I want $1200 cash."" It must have been one of the Bellamy Gallery people or Ivan Karp or something who got paid. And she said she came to my house and my mother answered the door but why would my mother answer the door if I was expecting somebody-I would be right there. I do not know it was nutty. And I ran into one of the old kids from Max's and they told me they finally read Edie over the weekend and that they were not shocked by the drugs or anything anybody said about me-that the only thing that shocked them in it was reading that I sold some of my early films to somebody that they could not believe I would not be keeping them for myself. But see I did not really sell them-I have them back now the guy's contract expired. Oh it is all Fred's fault that I am in that book. He kept after me to talk to Jean Stein. Because she was ""social"" my dear and was having parties. So me talking to her made it look like I sanctioned her book. So it was so boring and gee it is such a sad family-Ethel does not speak to her sons. David Whitney gave us a tour of the Fairfield Porter show though and I looked at Mondrian and he just took tape and painted it and then Sidney Janis owned these things and it became a business. Then at 3:00 went downtown (cab $6). Drue Heinz called to wish me a happy birthday. So did some other people. I got a big twelve-foot weed from Renny the florist. Paige picked out a place to have dinner and I invited Jay but then he called back and Benjamin got the phone and Jay asked would I mind if he brought Kate Harrington and I did not say anything and then he asked Benjamin ""Did Andy just make a face?"" He just wanted to start trouble. He does these things so people will feel guilty when he does not want to come anyway. But Benjamin was great he just said ""Here's the address-if you want to come come."" And I would have yelled at Kate if she came since she would left work at Interview that afternoon saying she was sick. Well we went to 79th and Lexington to this place called Jams that we go by all the time and never knew was there this chic place. It was expensive but the food was so good. The whole thing was like the Four Seasons used to be when the guy was there who used to grow the garden stuff in his own patch in Connecticut. The dessert was incredible. Jean Michel Basquiat ordered a lot of champagne and he said he would pay for it but I would not let him (dinner was $550). It was underplayed nobody said ""Happy Birthday"" and it went smoothly. Paige had a strapless pink dress on and she took her camera into the kitchen to do movies. Jean Michel Basquiat dropped me off and it seemed like being with Jean Michel Basquiat did not bother Paige too much she is more recovered from him. Then when he was dropping me off he said that he wanted to go fuck her. I told him that that would just start trouble again. I told him he should give her some artwork because she is the only girl who ever really helped him out gave him his first uptown show and sold so many of his paintings. And she never would let him pay for her she was being very independent paying her own fare to Hawaii and things like that and I do not know why he never liked that somehow. And it was nice to see little Suzanne the makeup girl the night before at Limelight wanting not to get stuck with him-it was refreshing to see a girl trying to get away for a change."

Then he left to go dye his hair. Glued myself and went to pick up Catherine at 8:50 but as we were leaving her place Tom Sullivan called and said he would pick us up on the corner in his limo and we waited there but he did not come. Then we had to leave to be at ""21"" (cab $2). When we got to ""21"" Jay Mellon was sitting there alone no one had arrived for my birthday dinner. Then we had drinks for an hour and still no one had arrived. The dinner was supposed to be at 9:00 and it was 10:00 already and still nobody was there. Catherine went upstairs to see if maybe they were in the room up there but they were not. Then I went out to call Eartha and see where she and her daughter Kitt were and Kitt answered the phone and she said her mother had gone out with Barry Landau! So I mean I said thanks a lot and hung up. Finally about 10:00 Lou Reed arrived he gave me a great present a one-inch TV and he was so adorable so sober and Jay and I were in dark suits but everybody else was light-Lou had a whole suit on with a bow tie. Then Fred arrived with Nenna Eberstadt and they were both in white and Nenna was a little embarrassed she gave me a little present. And then Tom Sullivan arrived and gave me the shirt off his back and made me wear it. And Winnie is not really that beautiful I was surprised he would marry her. She does need a green card though. But Catherine does too. Halston arrived with Dr. Giller and Stevie all in white. And everyone was nervous because it did just look like all family and we went to a room and it was really pretty and Catherine put people together well and it was thirteen people I think. I was drunk and nervous. The dinner was good Catherine had ordered duck and Senegalese soup and at a certain point Stevie said that he knew Lou from Syracuse University and he said all these details so that was funny they went to school together and they are both from Long Island too. Then a cake came and the waiter sang ""Happy Birthday."" Victor never showed up I think he was embarrassed about his hair and then Halston excused himself to go to his house he said that he just wanted to get ready for drinks to meet us there and we went over I think in Tom's limousine I can not even remember I was so drunk and when we got to Halston's it was a big crowd and I got a singing telegram from a lady in a bowler hat from Bill Dugan and Nancy North and she really belted it out she was a good singer. And there were Barry and Eartha! I could not believe it. she is so stupid. I guess that is her problem-she did not know the difference between dinner and this and that is what is wrong with her-I mean she works hard but she would not have to work so hard as she does to get what she wants if she were not so stupid. It was the nicest kids there. Pat Ast was there she is in town and everybody from the office. And the first present was Stevie brought in a garbage can and it was filled with 2000 one-dollar bills and he dumped it on me and it really was the best present. Victor gave me a hardhat. And Halston gave me a white fur coat but then he said it looked small and he took it away and said that he would give me another one later so I do not know. Jed was trying to fix his sister Susan up with Jay Mellon. Susan is looking so pretty now. Left about 4:00 left everybody at the party."

And it was just so peculiar because I saw her and she denied it to me. I mean she should have just said she was guilty she should have just said ""Oh my god it is true I am a thief"" something like that. And Jackie Curtis called me over the weekend to wish me happy birthday. Cabbed to meet Lidija ($5). Chris came over and he is raving about the ""expanded family"" life they are having-their ""modern marriage"" where they are both seeing different people and acting like they live in a commune. I think it is all disgusting and I told him I do not want to hear about it. I am now telling Vincent to give Christopher less darkroom work I want to punish him. Glued myself together and then went to Claudia Cohen's new apartment on Central Park South where she was having a party to look at the five seconds of fireworks that were going to be in the park because of Beethoven's overture. She was having a big fire on her balcony I am surprised she did not get into trouble for it. She was barbecuing hamburgers. And I had some because I was starved."

I mean he can not be that unhappy and he can not be overworked. I mean all he does is go to parties (cab $3). Tinkerbelle and I started talking shop. She just did an interview with David Warner for us. Tinkerbelle is so great I do not understand why she has not made it to the big time.

Plaza for Mrs. Kaiser's dinner for Halston (cab $3). But then we realized we would forgotten Bianca so we had to go back to pick her up at the Pierre. Victor gave her some coke but she did not want it. The first person we saw at Mrs. Kaiser's was Martha Graham and C.Z. Guest was there. Paul Rudolph had done the apartment and he was there. White on white. She has a bedroom as big as 860 with one bed in it and a floor-to-ceiling glass window with a view just what terrifies me but it was beautiful. Marisol and Larry Rivers and Elsa Peretti and Jane Holzer and Bob Denison were there. Polly Bergen and I talked about the topic on her TV show that morning-androgyny.

It was snowing hard. I went in to Interview and stood there finding typos in the Nancy Reagan issue. I just do not see why there should be even one. And it is something people really notice. it is like that secretary from Interview saying she saw me in the laundromat on Columbus Avenue with Jon doing his laundry. It stands out so people remember it.

A lady from 67th Street rang the bell and said we were flooding her house and I looked in the back and there was a lot of water but I did not know what to do until Jed came home. It was a water pipe broken shooting upwards.

I do not know how he decides these things he is very abstract there is no pattern. John Powers called he is back from Japan he said he had a new magic watch that has a crystal instead of a battery but he sounds older all the time so I do not know if these crystals work. it is funny about voices Diana Vreeland still has a young voice. Strong. Keith was putting down Schnabel saying that he sat himself right down next to Dennis Hopper at Tony Shafrazi's dinner for Dennis over the weekend and then made the speech about Dennis although he did not even know him. Oh and Dennis told me the other night that they cut the scene out of Blue Velvet where he rapes Dean Stockwell or Dean Stockwell rapes him and there is lipstick on somebody's ass. Then went up to the Metropolitan Museum for the Shiseido party. I guess maybe they funded the Vreeland costume show and so then they got to give a party there. They had two big Flower paintings of mine. Peach with black outlines. One was a gift from Peter Brant and one was a gift from Irving Blum who I did not even know had one. The museum should get all of them-I mean that is how they are supposed to be-all together. Then from the museum Steven Greenberg gave us a ride down to the first party at the Tunnel on Twelfth Avenue and 28th Street the club that is built in the tunnel of some abandoned railroad tracks. I am the one that told the Bonjour jeans guy to just keep the name the ""Tunnel."" And it was fun there good music and Glorious Food. Serge the Glorious headwaiter came over and said hi. Haoui was the doorman Rudolf was there it is a great building. Ian Schrager was there but he walked out of one of my pictures. I guess he did not want to be photographed at somebody else's club. He was in this beautiful blue suit and tie and he is gained some weight so he is got that hefty stocky prosperous look. Handsome. Like James Caan. Steve Rubell was in a business suit the other night saying ""I am still in my business clothes I just closed a deal."" Talked to Stuart. He said that this one guy was giving so much of his time to do charity work for Stuart's school but I told him ""Look there is a reason a person will give up so much time it is not for nothing-either he is down there using your phones or he is getting away from his wife or he is using your limousine or he is drinking up your liquor-it is always something it is never for nothing."""

Hold on ... it says ""Patrick McAllister"" and I do not know if that is his last name but he has AIDS and it does not give Rupert's name but it says he has a boyfriend who works for a ""famous artist."" And now I feel bad because I have always been so mean to Patrick. He found out he had AIDS in August-oh but I have hated him for years. But still I do feel bad now and that would explain a lot of things that Rupert does now like going into macrobiotics and things and taking courses like EST. Chrissy Berlin was at the office and she loved her portraits. It was sort of busy. Fred was going off to Europe to sell art. My old model date Sean McKeon's back in town he is been away about a year doing plays in France. And this girl asked me about Sean she said ""Is he straight?"" And I told her yes. Because I mean how do I know different? I met him when he was with a girli And you have to believe what people tell you do not you? Worked till 8:20 then walked to the Ritz Cafe which is the new restaurant where La Coupole was. I was going to meet a Ford model that Paige invited for me. He was just back from Japan and he hated it there and it was just like listening to an exact copy of every other model-from New Jersey talks about motorcycles modeling eating and hating Japan. But they are good-looking and that is enough. The perfect nose and so much like Sean McKeon you would think they are from the same mold. And if you put glasses on them they could look distinguished but they are brainless. Paige brought a black Jewish lawyer named Rubin for Tama and he looked (laughs) black and Jewish. And Tama brought for Paige a novelist who is written four novels and he was jealous because Tama was in The New Yorker and Tama was jealous because he is had four novels published. And this was all about looking for new faces and brains and ideas. We were in a booth for six people and it was fun. Home before 12:00 and did not watch Letterman. I would seen the news earlier about the Mafia shooting in midtown which is so abstract. they are just doing it on better streets now."

And while I was exercising two big sharp pains went through me as if somebody stuck a sword through me angled down. I thought it was the end. Especially after seeing that accident on Saturday and how it could just all be over in a second. But it went away. It must have been some odd muscle spasm. Lidija was concerned. She does adjust things. Like we do not do stomach exercises anymore because it was making the bullethole in my stomach bigger. And we are going to make the weights less. I did used to lift weights when I was young. At Al Roon's. Before it became the Continental Baths and hosted Bette Midler. When it was just a regular gym. But I was not lifting them right. I was just lifting.

So Jamie is now the Carter court painter. he would just been in Plains for a week. is not that interesting? It seemed like Jean Kennedy Smith really has a crush on Jamie because she asked me to go to the coat room with her and when we got there she pulled out an American quilt and asked me if it was real and I said yes and then we went back and she gave it to Jamie. I reminded her that I saw her in Bloomingdale's the other week when we both were in the shirt department and she said ""Oh yes those shirts were Christmas presents for my family."" So it was just regular old shirts for her family but for Jamie it was an American quilt. She was the first to leave and then we we relived the faux pas that Lincoln had made in front of her; he forgot she was a sister and when they were talking politics he said that John Kennedy was ""corrupt"" and she just said ""No he was not."" After lunch we went down to Lincoln's house on East 19th Street and he showed us his art it was good paintings-Lincoln's brother-in-law Paul Cadmus George Tooker and Jared French all Realists who'd done paintings of muscle boys. He did not have anything of mine. Walked over to Union Square. Worked the rest of the afternoon."

Curley started crying and I told him he had to stop it or I was on the verge of cracking up. I was supposed to go out to lunch with de Antonio but I did not want to. I just ordered in and De and I ate in the conference room and the place was freezing and Mike the super the only one who knows how to get a little heat out of the boiler was out. I was in a terrible state I felt a cold coming on and I just can not work in the cold. Hans Mayer came by to pick up some paintings and we had them bubble-wrapped. I gave Hans a painting and I gave De a painting trying to get into the Christmas spirit but I could not. I paid some bills. I thought C.Z. Guest's Christmas Eve dinner would maybe be just the thing to get me finally in the mood so Bob and I decided we would go out there and take Jerry Zipkin and Liz Smith and Iris Love so that is settled. I will take Popisms to give as presents. Curley called and invited me to dinner and then Whitney Tower called and said Mick and Jerry would like to see me and I asked if I could bring Curley and they said yes. I stayed by the electric heater all afternoon but if I moved an inch away it was freezing. I sent roses to Jon Gould-I want him to get Paramount to advertise in Interview. Curley picked me up in a limo at 9:00 then we picked up Whitney. Jerry has a new apartment at 135 Central Park West and she just got a farm in Texas with her money and she wants a tractor. She gave me a present just what I have always wanted-a complete set of china from the Concorde! And I was so surprised I was so thrilled I do not know how she knew I liked it. But it is so funny to get something you really really want. And Mick was so friendly for the first time talking and talking and it was like we were best friends telling me all about leaving for Paris on the twenty-seventh for the Herzog movie Fitzcarraldo. And telling me all about it and being really nice. Meanwhile Curley was getting really drunk and I knew I had to get him out of there soon when he started calling Mick ""Michael"" and taking pictures. Curley still believes my father died in the Pittsburgh coal mines and because his mother's family the Melions own Pittsburgh he feels guilty so that is funny. So I got Curley out of there and I thought I could sober him up a little if I took him to the Brasserie. he is drinking so much these days and it is still fun but if he keeps it up it is like it is going to turn. At the Brasserie I ordered just everything ($50). Then Curley started crying and I said he had to stop so then he was good and started laughing and staggering again. He dropped me and it was still only 1:30 and still freezing."

This cover of Charlie Sheen is by Greg Gorman and he did the pictures inside too and it is the same old thing a nice face and nice clothes. But Charlie kisses so well that I wanted something different like him kissing a girl and we could still use the same pictures inside but just something different for the cover and Gael said that she would been looking at Weegee things that she wants a new look too. The office was busy. Fred's agitated he was going to go to Paris a day or two early to get away from Christmas he hates it. He saw me doing a business gift list and yelled at me that we were not a regular office and that I did not have to do boring things like that and that he wanted me to stop it that very moment. So I said (laughs) ""Okay."" And the bigger the box the less the present I have noticed this year. Rupert drove me home. Then Sam called and wanted to go out so I met him at Nippon (cab $5 dinner $50) and talked about what work he should be doing at the office. And it is so funny I made up things and accused him. Like of attacking somebody in the corridor and it turned out to be true! He began admitting things saying ""It was pure sex."" But maybe he was kidding. It was like Dynasty people overhearing people in the hallways. I actually said (laughs) ""I heard you in the hallway."""

I have a real take-all-give-nothing attitude this year. I am going to give the kids at Interview who I know Keith Haring watches and autographed America books. Worked till 8:30. Sean McKeon stopped by but these days I am happy just with my two children-Sam and Wilfredo. Benjamin is just so busy with all his other stuff lately. Doing P.R. for fashion designers. But he is such a good companion. I wish I could think of a way to mesh the things he does so that he would still be working for us. He does not want too much steady responsibility though. he is a free spirit. Saw The Color Purple and the men in it are so cruel to the women. A real tearjerker. And Whoopi Goldberg reminded me so much of Jean Michel Basquiat. The hands over her mouth when she laughed just everything (tickets $18).

Called a cab and Benjamin dropped me. Then called Halston and it was weird he said not to come by that he really was not doing anything this Christmas. Called Chris Makos and he was having a party for his neighbors and it sounded sort of bad. Christmas parties always are. Except at Halston's-they were always sort of nice. Went by and rang Claudia Cohen's bell on 63rd Street because I want to get invited to her wedding to Ron Perelman because Liz Taylor is going to be the matron of honor and her husband-to-be Dennis Stein is going to be I think best man. He works for Perelman that is where I met him. Every light in the house was on but they were not home. Dropped their scarves off. Benjamin picked me up and we went to Steve Rubell's new hotel Morgan's to the penthouse (cab $4). Steve's letting Bianca live there. And her personal stuff was all over the room where the party was so anybody could have taken anything. And I gave her and Jade scarves and hers was framed and then later I saw it on the bed and she would taken it out of the frame and I do not know why. I mean even if she did not like it it was art. And Dianne Brill asked me if I knew Jayne Mansfield and I guess I lied when I said yes because I could not remember if I really did or not. Because I have read so many books about her. Dianne wanted to know if it was voodoo that killed her.

We reviewed the night before. Halston revealed that Steve had spent the whole day with Roy Cohn and that he was only coming over for a while he had to go back to see him some more. At Studio 54 the IRS found a room full of cash. And now when I think about it hearing how much money Steve actually had he could have been treating us so wonderfully. He could have been so generous and spending so much and he just was not. He did take us to La Grenouille once but it could have been so much more. And they were talking about Bianca's divorce Steve saying she should hire Roy Cohn and sue Mick for everything but the thing's so complicated-Bianca wants to get the divorce in London and Mick wants it in France because France is where she signed the paper saying she would not get anything in a divorce settlement.

I told her to get me off some of these vitamins she is got me on but she gave me six new vitamin pills and I do not know if she took me off any. I think all the vitamins I am taking may be what is making me have so much trouble sleeping. Over the holidays for two days I finally did get sleep and one day I even slept till 10:45. And on those days I did feel rested. But usually when I wake up in the morning I feel aches and pains. And I am addicted to Valium. it is only a quarter of one that I take at night but when I was really trying for over a month not to take any I felt lightheaded and that is a withdrawal symptom. So I started again.

No more Union Square. it is going to be hard to get cabs in the new area. I am taking that whole big floor up there. And it was great to see Brigid frazzled not knowing what phone buttons to push really working finally-not knitting. I will miss ordering out from Brownies all the carrot juices and stuff. what are we going to do for food in this new neighborhood? I have only seen greasy coffee shops. Jean Michel Basquiat had a date with Paige last night and I think they made it again which would be a mistake. And I was just on the phone talking to Gael there is a thief at Interview-$20 was stolen from petty cash. I should do that it is an easy way to make money. Just go into Brigid's wallet and take money out. Julian Schnabel called and said that Arne Glimcher has ""an empty spot"" for Jean Michel Basquiat and me at the Pace Gallery. I mean poor Leo.

I wrapped gifts for Jade. Went over at 10:00. It was small there black tie. Bob Denison and Jane Holzer were there so I guess they have made up. Nancy North and Bill Dugan. Victor called from California and said he was having a good time out there. When the New Year came in we did kisses and ate. Dr. Giller was there. It was just so nice. Jade loved all the presents I brought her. Steve Rubell was there. Then at 3:00 Bianca wanted to go to Woody Allen's party at Harkness House on 75th. John Samuels had a car and double-parked. Woody's was the best party wall-to-wall famous people we should have gone earlier. Mia Farrow is so charming and such a beauty. Bobby De Niro was there and he is so fat. Really really fat. I know he gained weight for the boxing movie but would not it be funny if he could never lose it? He looks so ugly. He must be crazy because he is really fat. Mick came in with Jerry and Bianca ran over and was charming. I do not know how she did it but she got it over with she broke the ice they talked for about half an hour. She wanted to get Jerry nervous which she did. Mick shaved off his beard so he looks really good. We went over to Studio 54 and the look was ""ice."" Ice wall-to-wall and dripping down the walls. Then Steve said ""let us go down to the basement"" so we did. He just about said ""Anybody have any cocaine?"" He wanted it to be like the good old days. It was so filthy down there with the garbage and everything. Winnie was there without Tom Sullivan-she said he is in Hawaii. Then upstairs Duguay and the other hockey guy came in and I was trying to introduce them to Marina Schiano but they said their real girlfriends were there from Minnesota or Indianapolis or something so they could not do anything. Then it was 6 A.M. and Marina and I left and there was a riot outside people still wanting to get in. Jack Hofsiss who directed Elephant Man went by in a limo and gave us a ride there were about twenty boys in it. And I got out at Marina's because I knew if I stayed in it they would invite me to go with them and I wanted to get up and go to work. Marina invited me up for pizza and I went. I always hear that she gets the best food from all over the city that she has the people who work for her bring salami from Brooklyn and pizza from Queens and things like that so I wanted to try it out. It was sort of good a really cheap kind of pizza all dough and a little ketchup and a little cheese. Like the cheese does not come away when you eat it there is not much. And when I was there I noticed that she had a pile of food on the stove and she said it was for good luck you are supposed to have it piled on the stove on New Year's. So I was there and we talked and she was asking me about my house and I told her how much it cost to run it and she felt that I was being ""real"" and that she would really gotten something out of me and that this meant we were friends or something I do not know. I was waiting for it to get light out and it never did. I mean it was 6:30 and it was still dark and I thought the sun came up at 6:00 but I guess that last year when I left and it was light out it was 7:00 not 6:00."

Victor had said there was room for me at Halston's table at the Metropolitan opening we were all going to of Diana Vreeland's Russia show. When we got to Halston's Mrs. Henry J. Kaiser-Aly-was there she was in a blue-green Halston with emeralds and she seemed very interested in me and when Halston saw us getting along he suggested I take her upstairs to show her the portraits I did of him. After the trip upstairs though she dropped me I guess she saw me in the light. We were all waiting for Marisa and her new husband and Bianca and her date Joe Eula. The acupuncture doctor they all use was there Dr. Giller so he is on their party list now. Barbara Allen was there the only one of the ladies not wearing a Halston. She had on a beautiful off-the-shoulder Christian Dior. It was from her shopping spree in Paris last month when Philip Niarchos was buying. Marisa came and she had her hair piled all on one side of her head like a beautiful old-time star. Bianca had her purple fox with her the one she is had around the past month. When Joe walked in he and Halston ""shook hands"" and when Halston felt what Joe put in his palm he said ""Oh you have saved my life."" Victor took me into the garage to show me his latest artwork-he is (laughs) making Mona Lisas wearing Halstons and that is really funny so I encouraged him. Then we went to the Met in four limos. This was the biggest one of these things the museum has ever had. When Diana walked through we all kissed her. I talked to Mrs. Kaiser and got to know her. she is about sixty but she looks forty and she says she is looking for a fuck. I told her it is the wrong town everyone's gay and she said she did not care-""they tumble well. I have had some good luck here."" She lives at you.N. Plaza. It turns out she is a very good friend of Brigid's mother Honey Berlin. She said that when she was at their house old Dick Berlin was so senile he walked in and rushed over to the mirror and tried to shake hands with himself but she saw what he was doing and went over and was the hand for him to shake. I left right after dinner Mrs. Kaiser dropped me. Oh and also at the dinner table Bianca took off her panties and passed them over to me and I faked smelling them and then tucked them in my handkerchief pocket. I still have them."

And Leo called and said that the portrait of Laura really was destroyed and I just do not know what to say to that. I am not going to give them a free replacement. If they want another one they will have to pay for it. it is not my problem it is their problem. Fred was out all day helping Diana Vreeland because I guess she was nervous about her show that is opening at the Met. Halston had ten of his models and six limos and so we all got in different ones and it was fun. At the museum Marisa Berenson was doing a thing for Entertainment Tonight so we went into a room for photos. There were lots of photographers there. Every snazzy lady in town-Brooke Astor Enid Haupt-everybody in glamorous dresses. And Raquel Welch was really sweet she is so happy because she is a hit in Woman of the Year. The costume show was eighteenth-century clothes. The kind of dresses with the wide wide skirts so you could not fit through the doorways. What is the reason for them? Was it to go to the bathroom and nobody would see you? that is what Patti LuPone told me once. Oh and I talked to Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and that was fun he is really handsome.

There were three limos out front and we went to the Met Museum to Diana Vreeland's opening-night Costume Institute dinner. It was the 650 people you know best. Someone who came in said John Lennon was shot and no one could believe it so someone called the Daily News and they said it was true. It was scary it was all anyone could talk about. He was shot outside his house. When I got home I turned on the TV and they said he was murdered by somebody he gave an autograph to earlier in the evening.

And they want me to design a curtain and a poster and I should have told them to talk to Fred. I will not be able to do anything with that little gold Noguchi lion medallion that Peter Martins brought to show me-if that is what they want they should just have Noguchi do something. But if they want me to do something it should be more American. Oh and Jock said that after the AIDS thing Sunday night the reason they did not go to Indochine was because Mercedes Kellogg and Sid Bass go there so Anne Bass did not want to run into them so they went to Nell's. Fred came in with Mary Boone in her fur coat and she wants me to go with her gallery I did not talk to Fred yet about what they talked about at the lunch. She sits there and smiles. The Ileana Sonnabend kind of smile. And Fred after another fight last week that I guess I forgot to talk about with Paige and everything he called me and said that he decided to change and so he is done a ninety-degree turn and he is trying to be a different person.

The two McDermott-McGough artist kids came by to visit. they are living down on the Lower East Side and since they do everything nineteenth-century style they have not had a phone or a kitchen but now they are having that stuff installed in just one room of the apartment. So they are coming around. But they were still dressed in nineteenth-century. They said they had just had meetings at Paramount with Jon Gould and this is about those stories that I taped them telling and had Brigid type up. Now they say he wants to produce that movie with them. Well I predicted this right? What a swell guy."

And James Brady on Page Six was so mean because he reported that Mayor Koch had asked for all thirteen episodes of Brideshead Revisited on tape to imply that that must mean he has a ""problem"" but it was mean to put it in the paper when his father just died. So since our lunch was cancelled I went down to Odeon where Leo's workers were having a surprise party lunch for him. The ride took an hour ($10). It was just star-studded. There was a different artist at every table-Jasper Johns at one table Robert Rauschenberg at another one Dan Flavin at another Artschwager at another Richard Serra. I sat at a table with James Mayor and Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Lewis and I went over and said ""This is the table I want to sit at because everybody here owes me money."" So Mrs. Lewis gave me a dime. I gave Leo underwear and a snot rag with dollar signs and he loved it no one else brought presents. And his wife Toiny was there and I had copies of Interview with me and people told me to put it away because it had the interview that showed Leo's girlfriend Laura de Coppet and she and Leo were still having an affair and people told me it would caused a big fight-that Leo was supposed to go to Rome and Toiny saw the interview and got so mad she tore up his ticket and he had to stay in town an extra day. It was the biggest fight ever they said. Hans Namuth took every artist to the bathroom to take pictures and I decided to be a camp and I cuddled and felt up Rauschenberg and found out he has a bad body."

Barbie (laughs) has problems. The fifties Barbie had a more closed mouth and beautiful sensual lips but the eighties Barbie has a smile. I do not know why they gave her a smile. I could never relate to Barbie because it was too puny. Someone told me that the Arabs have just commissioned a bigger Barbie. Fred said it was through Billy Boy that I got the portrait. I think he asked Billy Boy to suggest it to Mattel. I will have to get this straight from Fred it was a surprise to me. I did not know how it happened. And I guess Billy Boy has a lot of great sixties stuff because all those pictures in the display cases were his-of Edie and me and all the Vogue things and the Cow poster. How does he have time to do this-collect his antique couture clothes and design his jewelry? I think Bettina has done a lot for him. Fred said Bettina was who the original Barbie was based on. I talked for a minute to Mel Odom who designed a lot of the stuff in the show he is very talented. And they unveiled my painting and the Mattel president said he just could not wait to see it and I just cringed. Then left and went to the Peter Allen birthday party at Bud's on Columbus and 77th Street. Liberace came and he looked great. The papers say he is been sick but he does not look it. He called me over to be photographed with him but then it still looks like you are pushing your way in.

Her husband tells her she is ugly-Thomas says that is how Swiss people treat their wives because they never want them to get too secure. We gave them a book and an Interview and we sent out the film. it is so hard to find anything but SX-70 film here they are phasing the other out. We bought English papers which I paid for ($5). We had lunch downstairs in the restaurant with Loulou de la Falaise Klossowski and her husband Thadee and Thomas. We signed for it. The food was good. The place was so beautiful with a view of the lake and the mountains. We were the only people there and the sun was beating through the window on our backs. it would been hailing in the morning. The weather has been so strange. Loulou told us that YSL really was such a genius that he just can not take it he has to take a million pills and the whole office gets so depressed when he is depressed except for her. She said she acts happy no matter what. that is why she gets sick because she is always trying to act happy and it is really a lot of stress on her liver. She has not had a drink in a year and a quarter but she does not think cocaine is bad. I do though. We talked about her stepfather John McKendry. She said he had so many boyfriends. His idea of marrying Maxime was fantasizing that her son Alexis was going to live at home with them and that he could have an affair with him. But the son immediately got married and moved to Wales. Then he envisioned Loulou being there bringing home pretty boys every minute that he could fuck. And actually he did steal her boys. Loulou said John McKendry was actually killing himself slowly because he would always fantasized how great and romantic and wonderful and literary the aristocracy must be. Then when he met them and married a countess-her mother-and got to meet Jackie O. and people like that every day through his job at the Met he realized they were just normal dumb people like everybody else. There was nothing left for him to live for. Of course I think that Maxime just drove him crazy. I could not say that to Loulou though. Then we took a cab downtown ($10.50).

And that is when it started to dawn on me-these auction houses can put the gavel down any time they feel like it. Right? Right? Think about it: Like you will be at Sotheby's and the guy will go ""Twennnty dolllars ... thirrrrty dollllars ..."" You know really milking it so slow. But then some other time it will be: ""Nine thousand-nine five-ten-ten five-sold! History!"" You know? So fast. So then they took us down and showed me the drawings of mine that are up for sale and there was one fake. And Christie's is doing a big dress sale selling Diors and Schiaparellis and things. they will get $8-10000 for a Fortuny. So I have just got to track down that man who had that great shop in the Village-Fabulous Fashions. He had to move and now he is somewhere on West End Avenue selling out of his apartment. I have got to find him. And Iran really fell. it is so weird watching it all on TV it really could happen here.

Got there (cab $5) and Benjamin looked great very fashionable and I can really see why he gets so much drag work. Oh and we got Lidija in the pictures too so it is all nobodies and the French will think they are somebodies. Which is a new thing because the somebodies are everywhere you are sick of them.

When I think of all those French ""antiques"" I have looked at that were probably just props from store windows.... Ken arrived.

Then went down to the office and Julian Schnabel was there he was being really charming to Fred I can not figure out what he wants out of him. He was nice to Fred once before and I forget what it was he wanted then. he is being reeeally charming. His book is coming out. Who does he think he is? he is just pushy and energetic. Well but that is all life is being pushy and energetic. And he was just down in Miami and he met Gael there and he hated her. He came right out and said we should fire Gael and hire his wife to be editor that Gael was stupid and pretentious and fat. He took Fred down to his studio. I really wonder what he wants out of Fred. And Brigid has disappeared for a week. On Friday she ate a whole cake in one second and then she announced she was not coming in the next week because she was going to London to a fat farm. Would she really go all the way to London for that?

Heard about the Tylenol mystery on the news. I watched Letterman and he is suddenly gotten too sure of himself. Too cocky. it is not becoming on him. He had Raquel Welch on.

And the discotheque on the ground floor is still being built they had the nerve to send me an invitation to the opening. They broke the elevator and it was not working and I think the no heat is something to do with them too. Ronnie's trying to memorize his big role in the Walter Steding extravaganza performance coming up soon somewhere downtown and since I am Walter's manager I should find out where it is. It was great to be back. I thought it would be forty degrees but it turned out to be still twenty. I wandered around and passed out Interviews then got a cab to Union Square ($3.50). The heat finally came up in the front but it was still cold in the back. Brigid was working on the same piece of paper she was working on when I left. I mean she thought I would not recognize it?

A couple of people have called and said they were doing biographies of me. Fred told them we did not want them to but they said they will do them anyway. Worked and then they picked me up for the black-tie dinner at the Saint that Rado Watches was giving and it was all built around the painting I did and Sarah Vaughn singing. And we were all afraid to eat anything because the Saint has the gay taint from when it used to be a gay disco. It was so dark there and they were serving the food on black plates. But Sarah Vaughn sang and she was great-fat and sweating but she is still got a voice. And then they wanted us to go to her room and so they took us there and it was past all the bad rooms where all the sex things used to happen. We were holding our breath. And we told Sarah she was great but she was just interested in her drink she told somebody ""Cap my brandy"" or something like that. she will be at the Blue Note in April. Then we were hungry so Paige and Wilfredo and I went next door to that place called ""103"" on Second Avenue and that is where we should take people to dinner because it came to $11 for three teas a Coke a bowl of chili and two sandwiches. Could that have been a mistake? Left a big tip ($20). And we picked up a couple of waiters for Wilfredo to use as models in the shoots he is setting up in Atlantic City for Interview."

Tom picked us up there at 8:30 and we went over to the Garden and there were like 26000 people there! I thought wrestling was a dead sport I did not know so many people went to it. Dusty Rhodes was wrestling a Japanese guy. They all wear sequins all of them. I guess they got their style from Gorgeous George he really influenced them. And they strip on stage. Catherine went to take pictures but the fight was over in eight minutes. And now they are getting good-looking wrestlers. Dusty Rhodes said he would be right out but he did not come out until about twenty minutes. He wore lots of jewelry gold things and he had dark glasses on but when he took them off it looked like he still had them on he had huge dark rings around his eyes and he had lots of bruises all over. We took him with us to Monique's dinner (wrestling tickets $16). Then we went to the Lone Star and then they wanted to go dancing. Up to Hurrah's. Dusty was a little apprehensive when he saw all the fairies and he asked for a girl. The owner got a girl from someplace behind us and fixed him up with her.

He dropped us off at the Mark Hopkins had lunch at the Top of the Mark. Then we walked to the gallery three blocks away down a steep steep hill. The space was very large and it was just around where we used to stay with the Velvets [see Introduction]. The hanging was just wild. Rotten badly hung. Unbelievable. Bad taste. Mark's mother just horrible. Press conference TV show with a guy who was a beauty but he did not know anything and did not really like me and so I was being awful too. I took him over to a piece of sculpture and told him that I would done it which I did not-did not get found out until afterwards. Mark took us to the back where there were magic mushrooms. He took us for a ride across the Golden Gate Bridge. Under the bridge there were surfers. Very strange. All the boys wearing black suits wetsuits scary and nutty. Touring in Sausalito really fun. When we arrived back at the hotel Jed and his family were there he has a new fat stepfather. And Mrs. Johnson thanked me for being so nice to her son and made me blush. I had to stay around the gallery until 9:30. Mark's mother really made me work. Trader Vic's was just up the block. Walked there. Oh and Carol Doda the stripper came to the opening and I was so bored that I talked about her a lot and so Mark said we would go to the strip joint. Brought the limo back went to the strip joint Carol is now just as wide as high saw three naked girls rubbing their asses and cunts against the floor and Carol Doda came down on the piano and went up to the ceiling on it. She was so old that they only had blinking lights for her. Catherine and I were falling asleep (drinks $35). Fred had disappeared he was out cruising.
"Monday, February 22, 1981","[Alan J. Weberman, Carmine DeSapio, David Mahoney, Donald Trump, Gloria Swanson, Gloria Vanderbilt, Jason Robards, Jerry Hall, Jerry Zipkin, Joey Adams, John Kluge, Mark Goodson, Roy Cohn, Rupert Murdoch, Warren Avis]",0.04935425685425686,"Jerry Hall called. She said that poor Mick has been down in Peru with the Herzog movie and it rains all day and he has to sleep on a wet mattress and Jason Robards was taken away with pneumonia to a hospital in New York and now he does not want to go back. And I invited her to lunch with the Basses from Texas. When I was on my way home I ran into Alan J. Weberman the ""King of Garbology"" who was on the corner making a phone call. I knew who he was because he handed me a resume with all his garbage credits on it. He said he would just been through Roy Cohn's garbage and Gloria Vanderbilt's. I think he began his career with Dylan's. I was scared that he would see where I lived so I went in the other direction. Finally got home glued and walked to the armory. It was Roy Cohn's birthday party. Black tie. The Mafioso types were not in black tie though. Steve and Ian did not come because they did not want the publicity. There were about 200 people. Lots of heavies. Donald Trump Carmine DeSapio the D'Amatos David Mahoney Mark Goodson Mr. LeFrak Gloria Swanson Jerry Zipkin C.Z. Guest and Alexander Warren Avis Rupert Murdoch and John Kluge. And the reason I am able to remember so many is because Joey Adams gave a speech where he mentioned everyone in the room. I was talking to a guy and I said how terrible it was that they wanted to tear down this beautiful armory and he said he thought it was a good idea because he was in construction. They brought out a lot of cakes-each had one letter that spelled out ""Happy Birthday Roy Cohn."" Roy really got the press there the Times and the Post."
"Monday, February 22, 1982","[Jane Fonda, Kate Jackson, Mayor Koch]",0.21428571428571427,Got up early and went to exercise class. Brigid did not call but I knew that she was okay because she checked in with the office. The Mayor Koch lunch was still on for the next day at the office-I was surprised because he just announced he would run for governor and I thought he would break the lunch date. Jane Fonda called and I tried to call her back but did not get her so I wondered all day what that was about. Then later Kate Jackson called and it was fun to get these movie star calls. She said she was just calling to say hello and I told her I would loved her movie Making Love. And Chen from Liz Taylor's office called to invite me to Liz's fiftieth birthday party in London on Saturday but I think we will be in Belgium it is supposed to be a smasheroo.
"Monday, February 23, 1981","[Doris Day, Jay Shriver, Mary Tyler Moore, Ronnie Reagan]",0.05403544372294371,"Are called and said to meet Mary Tyler Moore at John's Pizza at 8:30 instead of 8:00 and I decided that I would just stay downtown and work until then. Jay Shriver dropped Brigid and me off (cab $10). The place was empty because it was raining heavily. it is a small place only about 20' X 40'. The owner had started to drink he was nervous because we were coming. They did not serve slices only whole pies. Brigid was still on her diet so she just had Tabs. But the owner was offering her wine and he was showing her the sixty kinds of pizzas and she was going nuts. The temptations were making Brigid weak in the brain. The owner was smashed. Mary and Ara came five minutes late and she was really sweet. The juke box was forties Sinatra and it was so loud. The owner had pulled up a chair and was part of the party. he would had the New York Times review of the place printed on the napkins. Well Mary Tyler Moore is trying to be a new woman. Brigid told Mary she loved her crow's feet which she does but it sounded insulting. Brigid was trying to get the conversation around to plastic surgery but she let it drop there she did not pursue it. And then Brigid said ""there is only one thing I want to ask you-are you going out with Warren Beatty?"" and Mary gulped and Ara gave a funny look and she said ""Well 'going out' is just you know 'going out.' "" So that was never answered. Mary looks like an old Barbie doll. she is perfect-short hair a beautiful body like the mother of Barbie. She looks like Doris Day in the fifties. And she eats a lot. And later I noticed she walks fast and never looks at anybody so nobody ever stops her. she is a dynamo. Then some cops came in to pick up some pizza and they were so good-looking. I asked one of them if he wanted to meet Mary Tyler Moore and ask a few questions. This cop was really cute he said he used to sing with a group called something like the Passions in the sixties or fifties and that they had a few hits. He asked her if she wanted to ride on a horse outside and she said yes that she wanted to right then but then he got nervous that something might happen to her so he gave her an honorary police card instead. They were flirting. Mary's studying political science and I mean with that voice she could really be the biggest thing in politics since Ronnie Reagan. She goes to a psychiatrist two or three times a week. And then she got a craving for a hot fudge sundae so I said Serendipity was the best really good place and she liked the idea of that. When we walked into Serendipity the whole place hushed-""there is Mary."" We sat under the lamp that was in my living room thirty-five years ago. I ordered half a sundae and so did Mary and Ara. And she is so ""assured of herself"" it is funny. Do you know what I mean? it is almost comical."
"Monday, February 24, 1986","[Dolly Fox, Greg Gorman, Joe Dallesandro, Rob Lowe, Steven Greenberg]",0.10308641975308643,Cabbed to the office to meet Rupert and he was back from the funeral ($5). I did not talk about it until later that night because I did not want to bring it up but he said it was weird. And Edmund calls Rupert all the time at all hours because he is so nervous. I invited Rupert to a movie after work. It was a busy afternoon with people coming by. Gael came in to show me pictures of Joe Dallesandro that Greg Gorman took for Interview and God he is still so handsome he looks really good-his skin is really strong I guess. Oh and Dolly Fox is dating Steven Greenberg and asking me to find out what the story on him and Margaux is. She said he picked her up at 8:00 and she was with him till 5:00 and he wants to see her again on Tuesday. Saw the Rob Lowe skating movie then took Rupert to Serendipity for cake and the waiters sang and he felt better ($20).
"Monday, February 25, 1980","[Heiner Friedrich, Monte Young]",0.12412121212121212,I picked up a couple of fans in the morning. One said he wrote in for me in the last presidential election. I ordered some Popism books from Harcourt Brace they make good presents. I worked all afternoon waiting for Philippa de Menil and Heiner Friedrich to come to dinner. They wanted to have a candlelight dinner at 860 they said. I can not figure them out they are strange they do not like to go out. we are trying to sell them some new stuff. Rupert brought some prints by. Heiner and Philippa came. I showed them the work. Robyn brought food from 65 Irving and put it in the stove. He stayed on to be the butler. Philippa does not eat anything but at this dinner she ate everything so either she is nervous when she is out at restaurants and does not eat or she was nervous at 860 and did eat or else she was just hungry for the first time. I can not figure it out. She even ate two pieces of banana pie. She was fun. Robyn got a good assortment. They asked why we did not come to La Monte Young's concert their Dia Foundation supports him. I did not tell them that I just could not face hearing one note. Heiner and Philippa are just back from Turkey. Oh and they sent the whole Whirling Dervishes to Dr. Giller for acupuncture. All of them. They said they still have not found a good building for a Warhol museum. The Dia Foundation is going to make one. The owner of the red building next door to us wants $300000 just to rent.
"Monday, February 26, 1979","[Joe Dallesandro, Terry Dallesandro]",0.03198529411764705,"Cab to Chembank ($4). I worked all afternoon painting faces' backgrounds at the office. Joe Dallesandro called from Paris. He says he drinks a bottle of whiskey a day. He wants money and I do not know what we are going to do with Joe. We were warned he would call because Terry Dallesandro came by the other day. she is still living on Staten Island and she looked good she had makeup on. She said Joe was not sending her any money. I wonder if she is on welfare? Little Joe was not with her he was in school. he is eight now. She still does not have any interests. She said she never even picks up something to read and she said she can not really do anything she does not even know secretarial stuff and she only has a tenth-grade education. I asked what little Joey was interested in and she said he was (laughs) taking karate lessons. Joe said that he had a ""film on the fire"" but that is what he said the last time. Oh and Terry said that six months after Joe's brother Bobby hung himself another boy who lived in that same foster home on Long Island that Joe and Bobby grew up in also committed suicide. Rupert called-both of the Du Pont twins have moved in with him on White Street."
"Monday, February 27, 1984","[Gloria Vanderbilt, Joe Dallesandro, John Reinhold, Lucky Luciano]",0.023965419501133782,"I was looking at the Christie's stuff the jewelry. In every auction they have some stuff of Gloria Vanderbilt's. I guess she gave them lots of stuff and it is just little junk. I guess they like to have a name in every auction and anyway if they would put it all together in one auction it would have just been embarrassing. And John Reinhold called and said he got another letter from the government about permission to drill holes in pennies. they would told him on the phone it was okay but he said ""I want it in writing."" So the government sent him this abstract letter saying you could drill holes in them but you could not deface them. This is so I can make more of the penny belts like the one I made for Cornelia. Was picked up by John and Kimiko and went to the Met and the opera was Tannhauser by Wagner. Boring. There are no great singers. I guess all the strong singers go into rock and roll now. The opera audience is still filled with boys with older men learning about the finer things in life. I was looking at some magazine and there was an interview with Joe Dallesandro done right before he did The Cotton Club-the Lucky Luciano role that PH actually got him because she knew the producer-and there was Joe saying ""Oh I never hung around with those Factory people they were not my friends."""
"Monday, February 28, 1983","[Berkeley Reinhold, David Whitney, Lou Reed, Maura Moynihan, Paige Powell, Philip Johnson, Sandy Brant, Tom Armstrong]",0.08829218106995886,Benjamin picked me up and we tried to feed the big gingerbread house that little Berkeley Reinhold had given me for Christmas to the pigeons in the park. But they did not like gingerbread and they did not like candy. And I tried to get rid of some fruitcake too and they did not like that either so I feel like just letting them starve. I mean what do they want? They do like nuts though so maybe I will bring them some peanuts sometime. Okay so then we went downtown ($6). Then met Lidija worked out then joined the lunch that was going on for Tom Armstrong Sandy Brant David Whitney and Philip Johnson. They were there to try to talk me into giving the Whitney all my old movies and they would restore them and catalogue them and show them but I do not know. Vincent says I have to because these people are friends. But I think maybe we should work ourselves on somehow trying to make them commercial. I told these people that when you describe these movies they always sound better than they actually are and that if people really saw things like Sleep and Eat they would think they were boring. I also told them that I would not be an easy sell that Tom Armstrong would have to entertain me at the Knickerbocker Club. Which is what was supposed to be happening anyway but Vincent just wanted to get this lunch out of the way fast. So they said sure and we will do that so I guess they think that I will do it but I do not know if I actually will or not. I am deciding. Then I was meeting Paige Powell after that at the Berkshire Hotel the one where the Rolling Stones stayed because there was a menswear convention there and she thought it would be a good place to leave Interviews and try to sell ads. I like Paige (cab $4). It was incredible there- every jacket was the same every sweater was the same. Five floors of clothes and they were all the same. Cabbed to meet Chris and Peter and Maura Moynihan. Then down to the Bottom Line to see Lou Reed (cab $8). And Lou's lyrics you can understand now (drinks $140.08) and the music was really loud. He did a lot of familiar songs but you did not recognize them they sounded different. Lou's in A.A. now and he is also working out getting definition getting trim. Chris was trying to clean Maura's fingernails because they were dirty. And she had a spot on her dress that she said she just got but it looked old. I mean she is Irish.
"Monday, February 4, 1980","[Jean Kennedy Smith, Kerry Kennedy, Ted Kennedy]",0.014814814814814808,I had to rush down to the office at 11:30. Jean Kennedy Smith was going to be there with Kerry Kennedy to pick out Ted Kennedy campaign posters (cab $4). Had to be photographed they had the whole press there.
"Monday, February 5, 1979","[Dolly Parton, Mark Gero, Murray Hill]",0.010606060606060603,"Halston called and invited us to dinner with Liza and Liz and Dolly Parton and Lorna and so went home to change. Walked over to Halston's but then Liza wanted to take me and Jed over to her place at 40 Central Park South to look at her boyfriend Mark Gero's sculpture. She said she would only keep us five minutes. He was not there-he was playing poker with his buddies at some Mexican restaurant on 86th Street and she was going there to meet him-but she made me write a note saying how good the stuff was and that I would get him a show. It was tits out of marble and alabaster and wood and she was rubbing the tits while we talked. Liza has not moved into her house in Murray Hill yet. it is so sad to see her apartment because she really has no taste and Halston's trying to give her taste trying to get Jed to do her apartment but I think all she really cares about is working she does not care about decorating. We dropped her off at the poker game and I dropped Jed off this was around 2:00 and then I went back to Halston's. Dolly did not show up neither did Liz. Halston and Dr. Giller said they were ""unwinding."" I do not know from what."
"Monday, February 6, 1984","[Andre Leon Talley, Barbara Walters]",0.19452651515151514,"Was picked up by Benjamin and it was a beautiful day. This was the first of me taking photographs for my assignment from French Vogue. I am being paid $250 a day. Got to our new building 33rd and Madison (cab $4.50) and Andre Leon Talley was styling the shoots and had told the Guardian Angels to meet us there and the only room that looked sort of like a subway to photograph them in was the basement. They were all nice kids. The leader Curtis and his wife were there and they are good-looking. And I guess they are still in trouble because they are accused of staging an incident and I would not be surprised if they did because they are theatrical. I mean everything about them is so beautiful. I went home and watched TV. Barbara Walters is just too goo-goo with that searching look and asking the same old questions: ""How old were you when you realized you had sex?"""

There was a guy cleaning the windows of the plane as I was going on and some people can just look up and say ""Hi Andy"" so casually and he was great he did that. Later he came to find us and asked for an autograph for his high school teacher. Cab in from the airport ($20). Dropped off the bags and Fred (called Vincent from the airport $.10). Sent Ronnie for supplies ($10.80). Went to 860 (cab $4). Jamie Wyeth was there talked to him (tea $10). Lester Persky called to invite me to dinner in honor of James Brady who is the new editor of New York. Geraldine Stutz was there. It turns out she is on the same council as Jamie the American Council for the Arts that gives money to artists. I think it is disgusting the artists they give the money to. They always pick the ones that are very ""serious."" Walter Cronkite was there. Lester started getting drunk and was really funny telling me how great it was that we were still friends even though he would never done anything for me and never would. And then he did his ""I am so rich now and I am still unhappy"" routine. Really does he do it at every dinner every night? He must. A famous male model came and sat down from Zoli. he would just had a baby in Alaska. I met the editor of the Daily News Michael O'Neal. I would never met him in all these years and I was thrilled to meet him. When I found out the guy knew all about Interview I really loved him. He was big and Irish with lots of hair grey. I introduced Catherine as the ""editor"" of Interview just so they could talk but she was being in a funny mood and did not really answer his questions. Jamie Wyeth had gone off to Elaine's. Catherine said she wanted to take a cab home. She must have made a date with someone maybe Jamie. An English kid came over from the bar where he would just been talking with Lester Persky and asked if Lester was really the Lester Persky the big producer and I (laughs) had to say yes. Larry Freeberg from Metromedia who first proposed that we do a TV show and then turned it down when Bob handed in our budget was there but I did not recognize him and stared at him blankly when he walked in. But that was good-maybe he will think twice about what he did to us."
"Monday, February 7, 1983","[Lord Neidpath, Marianne Hinton, Nancy Reagan, Shelley Wanger, Steve Aronson]",-0.05346560846560847,"Went to get black-tied for the Newsweek party. Lincoln Center by cab ($4). It was a boring party. No stars. Just Nancy Reagan and President and Mrs. Carter. Basically it was a big office party. The show of past Newsweek covers was interesting. Through all these years it was all war war war. We wanted to leave early to go to Marianne Hinton's party for Catherine on East 57th Street (cab $5). Catherine's husband-to-be was there Lord Neidpath. He was in Interview once as a ""First Impression."" I met him a few years ago. He has long black curly hair and he looks like he stepped out of the sixties like right off the King's Road-britches and a silk jacket. And Fred was there and Shelley Wanger and Steve Aronson. So Catherine's going to be a lady."
"Monday, February 8, 1982",[],0.10787037037037035,It was such a beautiful day that I decided I wanted to stay out until the sun went down it was so warm and sunny. On TV was a movie The Day the Bubble Burst about the big crash of the stock market in 1929 and Jon asked me if I was around for it. I said no.
"Monday, February 9, 1987","[Bette Midler, Dionne Warwick, Jacques Bellini, Mary Boone, Robert Miller]",0.08581323438466296,I went to the dentist really early in the morning. Dr. Lyons and his perfect American family are doing fine. Then Ken picked me up there. The temperature was dropping fast from the time I went out in the morning. Cabbed to the West Side to Dr. Li ($4 newspaper $3). Cabbed downtown ($6). Brigid had to go home to give her mother a morphine shot. She was back in a couple of hours it did not take long-she is really upset at the idea that her mother's going to go in the winter and it will be another funeral in the cold ground she would rather it would be in spring. And I do not know why they did not cremate Liberace right away and not give him an autopsy-they should have just rushed him through. I asked Paige to go to the Dionne Warwick perfume thing at Stringfellow's and we went down there. She brought the issue of Interview to show to Dionne that had the writeup we gave her perfume last year when it came out but then Jacques Bellini took it from Paige before she had the chance to give it to her. And Dionne's distributing the perfume herself it turns out. It smells like lemon chiffon pie. Very strong. And Stringfellow and his daughter were there and it was just so easy-got photographed and got out of there. Tipped the doorman ($5) because I thought it was the guy who always got me cabs at the Palladium and Studio 54 but it was not him. Went to Nippon (cab $6). Had dinner lots of free food-Paige paid. We talked about the shows I will be having this year-another photography show at Robert Miller and then some new paintings at Mary Boone ... I do not know yet what they will be. Finally made it to see Outrageous Fortune and it was not much-they did not even give Bette Midler one really great scene to do.

So I told her to invite Bianca and the Herreras and I picked up Catherine. And I also invited Allen Brooks the porn star. Cabbed to 19th and Fifth ($5). Gloria Swanson was there with her new young husband. Gloria used to be married to Maxime's ex-brother-in-law the Count de la Falaise. And she started saying ""I smell terrible fumes. I have to go to the window to get away from them. Where are they coming from? Check your stove. I have a very good nose and I know there are fumes escaping."" And I just knew it was the perfume I had on that she was smelling. It was jasmine from Shelly Marks. PH and I are doing research for a new perfume line and I was trying it out. And so I did not want to go near Gloria. I went into the bathroom and tried to wash it off and then for the rest of the night I stayed about four feet away from her even when she was trying to talk to me. I ran over and talked to Sylvia Miles. Gloria looked good though with short grey hair. Maxime served spaghetti. Mario Amaya that person who stopped by the Factory in '68 and wound up getting shot in the arm by Valerie Solanis when she was shooting me-he was there and he just quit his job at the Chrysler Museum in Norfolk."

Roger Corman himself has not seen Bad but Fred says that does not matter because Corman does not pick the movies that this other guy Bob Rehme does. they will try different ways of opening it around the country to see what works best before bringing it into New York. Bianca called and invited me to a dinner that Regine was giving for Florence Grinda and Catherine and Victor got on the phone and said they wanted to come too so she told them to come for coffee. Andrea Portago had called me earlier and asked me to take her to the dinner and I told her it was not my invitation so I could not but to call Bianca and she did and Bianca was thrilled because she is after Andrea's brother Tony and Andrea and Tony would come together. Andrea picked me up with her brother. We went to Regine's. Bianca was wearing a strapless Halston dress. There were South Americans at a lot of tables. The dinner had not started yet and while they were still in pre-dinner at the bar Catherine and Victor walked in for ""coffee."" When dinner started they were put at a separate little table and when Victor pointed at my table and said he wanted the same thing they said ""you will have to pay for it"" and he said fine. The food was awful. Regine was sort of rude to Victor and Catherine. Diane Von Furstenberg was there. she would called me to be her date for a CBS filming of her on Thursday she thought we would make an interesting TV couple and I told her I would be out of town- I am actually not leaving until Friday-but to come down to my party on Tuesday night with her TV crew. But when Regine invited me for Thursday night dinner DVF overheard me say yes- it is for Russian Easter-and said how dare I have lied to her so I was caught and I just said I would made a mistake. Victor gave out fake poppers. Regine said they smelled like feet and I told her they were called ""Locker Room"" and she liked that. Bianca started to giggle and she was carrying on over a popper with Tony Portago and they were sort of making out but she pulled herself together she realized that she could not do that in public but she is the most beautiful when she giggles and she loves those poppers. Some fans came over and I signed autographs. When Victor and Catherine and I left it was around 2:30 and the Portago driver dropped us. Then at 4 A.M. Tom Cashin called to talk to Jed because Jay had cut his arm and was bleeding and so Jed went to take him to the hospital. And then Jay called from the hospital and that drama went on until 9 A.M."

But Ronnie was careless he would left some paint in the middle of the floor and I kicked it and it went all over my boot and pants and it took the whole afternoon to clean up-that was the first time that would happened. And then the rock star from the Cars Ric Ocasek wanted to bring his band by to see his portrait so he did.

Went to Castellano's for dinner (cab $6) with David Whitney but without Philip who was off having dinner with some swells. And David still reminds me that he wants us to get married and now that I hear how many Jasper Johnses he has it would be really worth it. he is doing the David Salle show at the Whitney. He said that Jasper fell out of a tree at La Samanna but that he just broke a wrist. He and Rauschenberg have given up drinking so I guess they will live forever.

He and Rosemary were fighting again. The waiting room was rich ladies like Dorothy Hammerstein. The fat girl gave me my X-ray but she could not find the gallstones. So I took the white stuff and sat around and waited. I took a new breathing test where you blow in a container that goes around in a circle. I was finished by 11:00 (cab $4). Went to the office to meet with David and Sam Aaron who own Sherry-Lehmann the liquor store. They want a portrait of a bottle of wine. Then two guys from the IRS came in and they were really horrible screaming and carrying on and saying they wanted to see me and I hid in Fred's office area. There was a tall one who was really horrible and a short one who said he liked my paintings telling me how good they were. But the tall one was terrible and rude. We called Bob Montgomery our lawyer who was coming down for a 5:00 meeting. He said not to talk to them. By this time they said that what they were after was Rupert Smith. Fred said I still should not talk to them. The little one was trying to get me to say something. Finally they gave me a summons and left. They just want records cancelled checks or something. They were rude and awful though. And Bob Montgomery cancelled and rescheduled.

She had five margaritas. Her family sounds like Viva's she has a lot of sisters too but then she is more intelligent and more beautiful than Viva and her family because she is not so crazy. She hitchhiked in 1969 in Morocco. And she had us turn off the tape and she told us that she sat next to Nixon at dinner and he did not talk to her the whole time until he turned around and told her about the sex life of a panda and that was it. Margaret was wearing a new designer's dress. She said she was just on the list of the worst-dressed women in the world. She told us that wherever she goes no matter who else is around the photographers always go after her and keep snapping. Then we went over to Studio 54 for Scavullo's birthday party and it was true (cab $3.25). Margaret was dancing and the cameramen went crazy. Stevie had said there would only be one photographer but there were twenty to fifty. When they brought in the birthday cake which was in the shape of a camera for Scavullo they did not even notice the cake-they were still going after Margaret."

There were like eight rooms one had three coins in the whole room. Think there was one room that Alexander left some pots in. Alexander the Great-three pots and four coins. A room with yesterday's dresses. More tea and coffee with the director. Just sat there there was nothing to do. Carred over to see the secretary-general of the Council for Arts for more tea and coffee and ceremony. Dirty handprints on the wall as if they killed somebody and it was a work of art or something. Guys standing around. Everybody says the same routine: Where are you staying? How long have you been here? How long will you be here? When are you leaving? When are you coming back? Carred over to see a rich collector named Fahad al Dabbous. Chubby and cute. He had a lot of paintings around on the wall some Dalis one sort of big one lots of male friends there most in costume a couple of wives. They had drinks there also-only the rich remember? A big spread on table nothing compared to Iran's big spreads. The men looked fat but usually in costume you could not tell too much. But this one was chubby. He had bought the Marilyn and the Flower prints. He was wearing a girl's diamond-studded watch with a blue face. The Kuwaiti food was greasy-greasy roast. Bought crab soap ($6). At 8:00 we were picked up by Mr. Bater who was the cultural attache from the United States to Kuwait and taken to see the American Ambassador Morandi who was giving us a dinner. His wife was from Seattle talked so much it drove us crazy. They were Democrats. Dinner was served at 10:00. Left at 12:00 bored. Used the crab soap it did not work. Fell asleep in the bathtub. In bed could not sleep. Read the Ruth Kligman book again she was driving Jackson Pollock crazy in the car and that is when he ran into the pole. Gave it to Fred to read.
"Monday, January 19, 1987",[Frank Lloyd Wright],0.07268518518518519,-Paris We went to the Beaubourg and Chris got us in free and we saw the Schnabel show there and it looked great he looked like a talented artist and then we went up to the Japanese show it looked like they copied everything from the West a lot of Frank Lloyd Wright. Lunch at this chic cafe ($35). I went down to pee and it was a wonderful bathroom a big sheet of glass with water running behind it and you piss on the glass. So modern so weird. If Chris had not told me I would not have known where to pee. It looks like a fountain.

It was a half-holiday. I got to the office and I was a secretary answering the phone. Robert Hayes and Marc Balet came in to work on Interview. I called Bianca and she said to come right over to Halston's so we did and Dr. Giller the cute doctor was already there. We cabbed to Saturday Night Fever ($3) and when we got there it was all sold out. So then we cabbed to the other theater where it was playing and that was sold out too (cab $3). Then we decided to try to see the Bunuel film That Obscure Object of Desire (tickets $14 popcorn $4). It was really good more modern than his early ones because every once in a while when it would get quiet they would look out the window through the venetian blinds at the Paris street and a bomb would go off-somebody would be blowing something up. But none of us could understand the movie. it is one role played by two girls and they never explain why. Larry Rivers and his girlfriend came in and they sat near us. Larry told me that he did Aly Kaiser's portrait and she is the one that said she wanted me to do her portrait and Victor kept telling me to call her and I just did not. So Larry did her portrait and I think he must have had to fuck her I do not know. So we walked back to Halston's and he would fixed those pastas with meat inside them not ravioli but maybe they are called cannellonis? And he would made a chicken and we had lots of drinks. And Stevie Rubell was there and Bianca got upset because he reads the London papers and he quoted something Mick had said. It was in Earl Wilson's column here today about him and Jerry Hall so it probably was Stevie who gave it to him-I mean he pretends to be so friendly and then he calls up the papers. And there were so many English reporters outside Halston's waiting for a statement from Bianca or Halston. Bianca and Halston seem like they are a couple now they really do. it is like a romance. But Bianca is so upset about Mick and I am surprised that she is because she could get somebody rich in a minute. Somebody said to Halston ""Why do not you marry Bianca?"" and he put his hands on his hips and said ""Because I am the hostess here."" And then we all went over to a place called the Ice Palace on 57th and Sixth. it is lesbians and hustlers. Bianca was dancing around but she is so unhappy and she and Halston were trying to get Jed to go home with them and they were asking me if this was okay. She said ""Nobody likes me."" Everybody was wet from drinks getting spilled on them."

The driver said he would picked up Jean Michel Basquiat and drove him to the airport to go to Hawaii for two months. And I hope he paid his rent in advance. Got home and was really tired. Watched TV took a Valium. Never took a bath the whole time in Aspen never changed clothes. Just lived like a pig. that is a good story is not it? But my perfume worked and my breathing was good but I was depressed because Jon is so aloof. He says he needs to be his own person and I always feel like he is just about to leave so I never can feel relaxed.

Jennifer's away. And oh Jean Michel Basquiat must be so hard to live with. I told him I would had dinner with Kenny and the Chows and he wanted to know why I did not invite him and I said that I would called him three days ago and he did not call back. Fred said that the Boston Museum people were still vague about whether they were going to buy the big Electric Chair or not.
"Monday, January 21, 1980",[],-0.05977633477633478,I tried to find new spaces in the back of 860 for Interview so they can expand their office space. Bob says they need more because it is hard to lie to advertisers when other people are listening. But I do not think that is what is hard to do with other people listening. I think what it is hard to do with other people listening is make personal phone calls. Rupert came by and he would made the Shadows two inches smaller than I would said to-he just decided he would-and he had no right to do that and I screamed at him and now the stretchers have to be smaller.

Actually he would charged it to credit cards though-some kind of scam. And Jean Michel Basquiat is meeting all these women in Hawaii and he is going to L.A. to paint Richard Pryor and then going back to Hawaii. And Paige is going out there and I told her that she should make sure he is really going to be there when she gets there. I mean she will make all these plans and she will get there and he will be gone. Oh and this kid came up who said he was Rupert Murdoch's nephew and Jay after his mistake with Sidney Poitier's ""son"" was saying this time ""he is a fake I know it."" But I think it was a real nephew because he left quickly he did not stay on and on."

Went to the West Side to Dr. Li's (cab $4). Our Charlie Sheen cover is really good timing. Platoon is the big thing. And Interview's coming down an inch Gael said. With the new postage rates it will save $20000 a month. I guess a big-size magazine does not mean anything-I do not know what does. Paige said there were big advertising dinners on Wednesday and Thursday and Nikki Haskell called and invited me to a couple of parties at the Tunnel on those nights. I do not know about these advertising dinners-you give up a night of your life just to try to get one ad. But on the other hand you do meet people and sometimes it turns into other business with them. Nick Rhodes called and wanted to go to dinner. Cabbed to II Cantinori ($5). And when Pino does not do the food it is just awful. It was also with Elizabeth Saltzman and her new boyfriend- Glenn Dubini! And it was so odd to see him there making out with her. And I guess he does have money after all I was not sure when he was with Bianca. They had just flown to the Superbowl in a private plane and stayed at the Beverly Hills and come back the next day. Simon LeBon and Nick Rhodes arrived (dinner $240). Oh and I talked on the phone to Glenn O'Brien about why the sixties were coming back or something he was doing an article for Elle he was fun. Got home and at 12:00 the phone rang and it was Billy Name. Have I forgotten to say that he is been calling? he is up there in Poughkeepsie and he is organizing a sixties reunion and he has like three jobs up there deputy sheriff and everything and he was just chattering away-""You know how deeply I love you honey""-about how Gerard is coming up and Ingrid Superstar and how I would be picked up and taken to Stephen Shore's house-he works at Bard College now-and all this stuff. But I am going to just have to tell Billy that I can not face the past. And I would walked into the house and did not look where I stepped and so I was talking to him with dog poop all over my shoes."

It looks like the construction on the ""Underground"" discotheque is almost finished. (laughs) The Underground I am not kidding that is what they are calling it. they are making it look like a fortress. they are putting in the big air-conditioning machines.

But he is drinking too much so he still thinks he does them. Went to Madison Square Garden (cab $3). Jenette Kahn wanted me to meet Sonny Werblin who is the president of Madison Square Garden to talk to him about painting the floor for the Knicks. Just like Bob Indiana did for his home team out in Indiana. We talked to Sonny and he said it sounded like a good idea. He asked to see the floor that Bob Indiana had done and Jenette has already sent away for pictures of it. The game was boring. The Knicks are slow they are a good team but they are too slow they miss so many baskets-the other team got every basket they tried for. Then I had to take Jenette to dinner and she said she would like to go to Trader Vic's. Had to do small talk for a couple of hours. I think she has a crush on me. she is intelligent and glamorous with big tits a good head. And she is very organized. She can spell things out. I am convinced that if you can spell things out very simply and say everything clearly right away you will be a success in business. Like Bob Denison can do that. And Jenette does it with charm she comes right out direct and says things-like what we wanted from Sonny Werblin. And on that plane that was hijacked was also Joe Armstrong Sue Mengers Max Palevsky Theodore Bikel and Dino Martin Jr. How did they avoid the camera? Sue had the best line: ""If anything happens to me take care of my coat."""

Mr. LeFrak said why were not Mrs. LeFrak's eyes hazel in the portrait and then he said his nose was too bulbous. So maybe if we fix those two things it will get by. Bob still was not back from Santo Domingo from the Cisneroses. And Time magazine has Cornelia as Deb of the Year.

Catherine got a call from Tom Beard and Joel McCleary inviting us to a dinner they were having at Elaine's with Bill Graham formerly of the Fillmore who gave us-gave the Velvet Underground-our first big break in the sixties but then kicked us out. Dinner was not until 9:30 and Catherine's been out so late she falls asleep all day so she was not ready until 10:00 and I picked her up. She was packing her tote bag to go over to the Westbury because Tom Sullivan is out of town and told her she could stay there and order room service so all she could think about was sausages and eggs in the morning. He left her a limousine too. she is really in love with him. She wears his clothes his Valentino coat and leather jacket. She said his father died when he was very young and left a lot of money that he would made a lot of money on a radiator part (cab to Elaine's $2.60). There were a lot of famous people there that I knew but I did not go to say hello-Candy Bergen Joel Schumacher. Fred was already with the Carter people-Tom Beard and Joel McCleary. Bill Graham and I got right to the central incident of our relationship-him kicking the Velvets off the bill at his San Francisco Fillmore in I guess '66-and it finally came out after all these years that what made him really hate us was not the Velvets' music-it was that he saw Paul eating a tangerine and throwing the peels on the floor of the theater! (laughs) Can you believe how long it takes to get the real story? So then everyone at the table thought we hated Bill Graham and did not talk to him-Bobby Zarem was there too with us and he is getting fatter and fatter-but it was not that we were mad I was just dead tired. But they thought there was ""tension at the table."" Dropped Catherine at the Westbury ($3)."

Warren Beatty was there looking a little older and heavier. Jack Nicholson was there looking a little older and heavier. Anjelica Huston and Apollonia the model were there. I like Apollonia now she is really sweet. And Catherine Deneuve was there who the party was for. Warren was dating Iman the black model. Barbara Allen and her beau Philip Niarchos were there and James Brady and the Women's Wear Daily guy Coady. He was carrying on at Barbara and Philip's table and Philip was trying to be charming and Coady was with a beautiful girl-I could not figure out how he would be-and they left early. Barbara Allen came over and told me that Coady had been saying ""I hate everything here. I hate Jack Nicholson I hate Warren Beatty I hate Andy Warhol I hate Diana Vreeland and most of all I hate James Brady."" Oh and the food. He also hated the food. Philip was drinking and getting cuter. Barbara really seems like she wants to get married I think she wants to have children with him. Ruth Kligman had called me that afternoon and I told her I was seeing Jack Nicholson and would talk to him about starring in the Jackson Pollock movie. She asked me if I could take her to meet Jack and I said no. (laughs) I would not take her anywhere after reading her book. She actually killed Pollock she was driving him so nuts. A fifteen-year-old girl Philip knew from St. Moritz was there with her father and she was talking to Philip and Barbara was nervous because when you saw them together you could really see that girls like Barbara and Apollonia had lived-they looked old-and this fifteen-year-old's charm was that she was so young and like a little girl like she had not been used yet. Jack stopped by the table and I said I was going to send Ruth Kligman's book and he said she would already called him."

And there was this Puerto Rican kid sitting there and I asked what he did and Keith said the kid does the writing in Keith's graffiti paintings so I got confused I do not know what Keith does.

It was only Steve Rubell and Victor and Halston said that two days ago he bought 100 acres in Montauk with Lauren Hutton. So now there will not be condominiums between Dick Cavett's place and ours.

Or maybe it is something in the buildings on either side of me maybe radiation from the doctor's building. Maybe it is the teddy-bear coat I sleep in although the label says it is all cotton I do not know. it is Armani. I somehow feel it might have a little polyester it has that fuzzy feeling. And I also sleep under the Larissa leather coat that Jane Holzer gave me it is so great. Jane keeps saying I never wear it and I tell her I wear it every night. Paige picked me up and we went to the St. Regis for the Adolfo show. The clothes are beautiful but it is so abstract to me that somebody should copy Chanel suits for years that you would make a career out of copying somebody else's suit. it is been decades and it is still the same suit. There was a tall lady next to us and I did not smile at her or anything I did not know who it was and then later I realized it was Evangeline Bruce. There were so many ladies there that I just should be doing portraits of just every one was one of those rich ladies. And they still have all their energy from not having hard lives. You know Heather Watts is so interesting. she is in this ""reading group"" that Anne Bass is in they all read the same book every month and then they meet and discuss it. And it is all these rich ladies like Brooke Astor and Mrs. Rupert Murdoch and Drue Heinz. And they meet at a different member's house every week with the butlers and cooks and maids and Heather says she is the only poor one and that she is the only one who reads the books. She dropped out of school at fifteen. And you know how vivacious she is she said she heard about Anne Bass's group at a party and she said ""I want to be in it! I want to be in it!"" Heather can not wait for the group to have to come to her loft and they will all sit on the floor. Then Paige and I went to the Robert Miller Gallery and the show of my photographs looks absolutely great. Terrific. The catalogue looks good but Stephen Koch's essay throws in the same old names like Duchamp and Brassai. Brassai!!! And if they would had some young person do it it would have been different names and fresher. I decided not to go out and just rest up and be fresh for the opening of the show."

Bianca kept calling Stevie but she could not get him. It came out later on that Bianca only wanted to go because she would heard Jackie O. would be there and she wanted to get photographed. Jed and I went over to Bianca's thinking she would have a car but she did not. Jade was coming too. When we got to the theater everyone was staring looking around for Jackie O. The Act was good again. Bianca was putting it down but toward the end when she knew we would have to go see Liza she started putting it up saying it was great. Jade had to pee. Jackie and Swifty Lazar and Jack Haley and Bianca all had their pictures taken and everyone was staring while they did. And afterwards we went backstage to see Liza. I pointed my tape recorder in Jackie's direction and I hope I got a little breathy talk (tickets $60). Then we cabbed back to Halston's ($3) and when we got there he was just going to bed. You could see he was really ready to go to bed he had Linda in his arms and everything. Linda's his dog. Then Bianca got on the phone and made calls to find out who was where who was at the Ice Palace who was at Elaine's and then we went up to Elaine's (cab $2.75).

Halston had not dressed Bianca before she went out so she looked really awful when we went to the theater but nobody had wanted to tell her. But when we got back to Halston's he finally told her how terrible she looked. He had her take off the turban and put on dark lipstick and then she looked good. But then she realized how bad she would looked for the photographers at the theater. Jade was wearing a long dress. Then Peter Beard came in with a guy who had a beautiful glove on and a bottle of coke in the other hand and then later he showed us his hand which was a stump it looked like in the movies when they show the fiendish ghoul-he lost it in a plane crash his third plane crash a DC-10 that he owns.

All I had to say was: ""Tell 'em Warhol sent ya"" and it came out like I was reading it every time. Victor called and said he had to stay in a wheelchair for a month.

And Steve Wynn had with him two checks that totalled a billion dollars from some bank downtown-he showed them to us. he is really sexy he wears those kind of continental pants. When Benjamin went down to the car with him it was a beat-up old limousine. Benjamin was expecting something flashy. Walked the Village and then went to Tower Records and bought the Talking Heads album that Rauschenberg did the cover for. He was upset because he only got $2000.

She had on a red floozy skirt and backless shoes and her new blonde hair and these costume jewelry earrings with diamonds that her mother gave her. She was sweet talked and bubbled for hours. let us see the gossip she said Fred was seduced by the most beautiful girl Natasha Grenfell-Zeffirelli is her godfather and Tennessee Williams is too.

Mona and I were bored so we decided to look for Prince Albert we knew that he would be around someplace so we went searching and just could not find him so I said something like ""Oh shit we just can not find Prince Albert"" and he was standing right in back of me. So Mona got really aggressive with him and said we really loved him and wanted to get to know him she pushed her way right in and I said ""Do you want to meet all these great girls like Kerry Kennedy?"" and he said no. Then Regine caught our eye and she ran and got drinks and shoved them all in our hands and Prince Albert sat there and drank all of his drinks and just ignored us. Then Regine was smart enough to know what to do she went down and got the kids like Kerry and Mary Richardson and brought them up and we introduced them and Mona stepped on Prince Albert's toe and he said ""Do it again."" And then he said he was not staying he had to meet somebody and they were going over to Paradise. And Mona and I said we would go over and see them there so we were really excited because we would worked so hard to get this far. And I did not bring my tape recorder because I was wearing Jed's jacket and he would not let me put anything in it because it stretches the pockets. And so I could not tape. Then we went over to Paradise and there was Prince Albert and Mona grabbed him and really tried to hustle him again but he said he had to play soccer the next day early so he had to leave and we were stuck."
"Monday, July 14, 1986","[Albert Watson, Cecil Beaton, Tina Chow]",0.26915584415584415,"It was good to see the good old New York papers again (newspapers $4). I read in ""Suzy's"" column about the party Tina Chow had for us in London and it sounded so great. Paige still seems to be mad at me. I guess she is just living her own life now. it is better that way. Gael said that Albert Watson got the job as the queen's photographer. And after I just am reading Cecil Beaton and how much that meant to him."
"Monday, July 15, 1985",[Tina Chow],-0.00138888888888889,Saw Dr. Li and had fun. We were going to go back to the East Side but it was such awful muggy weather that we just went downtown. A girl came by with the Edie look but I told her there was not anything I could do for her. I guess she wanted me to wine and dine her and change her life but I mean ... Gael came in and she is losing weight. I told her she should start going on TV shows to promote Interview and make it sound glamorous. Tina Chow went out today and got her crystal. The crystal in the kitchen at the office still is not working-it still is not repelling the roaches. Vincent says the roaches even run around the clock in the stove under the glass. I am going to bring it back to Bernsohn again.
"Monday, July 17, 1978","[Barbara Allen, Dolly Parton]",0.19527777777777774,I had to think about what drag to go in to Halston's party later on so I sent Robyn out for a wig and he came back with the perfect one-a grey Dolly Parton ($20.51) and I put it on and wore the dress I would once designed for a Rizzoli art fashion show that was parts of six different designers' dresses all sewn together. Went over to Halston's. The first person we saw was Stevie who was dressed like Liza-he thought-in red sequins and he looked awful. All of the waiters who look so good in Studio 54 just looked like tramps at Halston's. Stevie kept pulling out his cock from under his dress and I was surprised it was big. Barbara Allen was the best she came as a man in a jockstrap. With a jacket and a mustache. Stevie's boa caught on fire and he would have disintegrated if some fairy had not put it out. Halston in drag looked like Diane de Beauvau. I guess now it is easy to see why he liked her so much that is the look he likes sort of fat-faced and chubby.

And she says that Paulette Goddard was her idol that she copied everything about her her hair her voice. Called Paulette and told her about the book how much Evelyn loved her. She said ""Oh yeah she loved me so much she stole all my boyfriends and when she stole my last boyfriend I dropped her."" Cabbed up to Suzie's ($2.35). Sandra Payson who is married to George Weidenfeld was there and as I sat talking to her a cockroach was running on her. I did not know if I should say something or not. But then maybe she knew because she stood up and said ""Shall we get moving?"" And that knocked it off. What would Emily Post do? I decided to really really hustle so I took Lady Weidenfeld home. We walked a little and then she was overheated and we cabbed to 25 Sutton Place ($2.50). We talked about Diana Vreeland's nose. She popped the question about how much a portrait is and I said ""Oh I can not talk money talk to Fred."" That effect. On my way home a cab stopped and I really wanted one but since it had stopped for me I was suspicious to get in and did not. Went to a magazine store ($4)."
"Monday, July 2, 1984",[Jean Michel Basquiat],0.03571428571428571,Jean Michel Basquiat called at 8:00 in the morning and we philosophized. He got scared reading the Belushi book. I told him that if he wanted to become a legend too he should just keep going on like he was. But actually if he is even on the phone talking to me he is okay. And the phone calls from pay phones are now $.25. I am just not going to make calls anymore. All the pay phones uptown were converted already to $.25; downtown there are still some $.10 ones left.

On the news was the tragedy of the weekend the hotel walkway that collapsed in Kansas City and a lot of people were killed. Oh and I am reading in the Enquirer about Kate Jackson and Andrew Stevens. Kate was out with us at Halston's in Montauk this past weekend. She was with Rock Brynner Yul's son. Kate will do things like look at the ocean and say how beautiful it is or go out alone and stare at the moon or walk along the beach alone and pick up a rock and throw it. (laughs) I am serious! That kind of corny thing. I do not know. she is from the South but still.... I stopped at John Reinhold's office to hear the news about the new diamond discovery in Australia and diamond prices are down. Went to the office (cab $5). I was really upset at Rupert because he is gone away for weeks to Jamaica and now half of his assistants are going on vacation too and I got really mad at one of them Horst because I was telling him that Rupert better watch out and if they could not help me that I was going to find myself another silkscreener. And Horst was laughing at me like a German-he said ""I should have brought you a rose so you would be in a better mood."" And I said ""Look do not tell me about roses-Rupert got the job in the first place because Alex Heinrici went on a vacation-a long vacation just like this one that Rupert's taking-and I just looked around and found somebody else. And I can do it again."" And I blew my cool all day-I hung up on a few people but it will be good for their memoirs."

The food is getting sort of boring though. And they serve it too fast. you are finished in an hour and a half and you have all that time to sit around and get edgy. And I stole so much silverware and I was afraid about customs I do not know if you are allowed to take them in or not. Got to customs and although I did not beep coming through the thing this guy took me to a room and had me empty my pockets and I had my vitamins on me I do not like them to go through the beeper and he was feeling them all up and then he went through my shoes and pulled down my socks and then he said ""what is that?"" when he saw my other drugs my painkillers and when I was trying to explain what they were he got impatient and said ""Oh go away."" I am really going to be careful what I take with me because I can just see them going through all my wigs and asking me why I have so many. We went from the freezing cold of Paris to 101 degrees in New York and it was a shockeroo. that is a Diana Vreeland word (cab $40)."
"Monday, July 22, 1985","[David Weisman, Jane Holzer]",0.04223985890652557,Went up to the Kiss of the Spider Woman screening (cab $5). This is the movie Jane Holzer produced with that David Weisman the Ciao Manhattan person. I can not stand him so I hate to say it but I liked the movie. And I guess people are wanting arty movies now or something it is the right time. I had to get home early and dye my hair because of my public appearance at Lincoln Center for Commodore Computers the next day. Dyed my eyebrows too. Black. I always dye it black first and then leave some white and everything. I am artistic sweetheart.

We got shirts that were made out of Nazi symbols and that you could tie yourself together with And a T-shirt of two cocks pissing on Marilyn Monroe's photograph saying the word ""Piss."" Catherine knew a little Italian restaurant where her family goes on Sunday. Nice Italian lunch ($100) and after that we got some flowers for Catherine's mother ($20) and Catherine took us to see her stepfather's mansion on Cheyne Walk. Whistler lived there once. Victor and I went back to the hotel (cab $7). It was Martha Graham's opening at Covent Garden. We all got ready and met in Halston's room-John Bowes-Lyon Dr. Giller me Randy Steve Victor-Fred went off with his date Sabrina Guinness. Liza went on before us. We all had front-row-balcony seats. They did three numbers and then Liza came on with ""The Owl and the Pussycat."" Then Martha gave a long speech about half an hour. They were all wearing beautiful Halstons. Lynn Wyatt was next to Fred then moved up next to John Bowes-Lyon. Then backstage hello to Liza and Martha and then a little cocktail party in the bar part of Covent Garden. Covent Garden was very beautiful it looked like the old Met. Then drinks and then we all walked to the Savoy-Halston was giving a private party. We were upstairs and we did not know the party was upstairs and downstairs. The downstairs party had Princess Margaret and Halston Liza and everybody and when we finally realized we were missing it we went downstairs. Halston was nervous but his party was terrific had the best time. Victor wanted me to meet Princess Margaret and I did not but I got two pictures. Victor got two photos of Princess Margaret and Roddy Llewellyn. They did not want to be seen together and they wanted to take his film away but then Fred said not to that Victor was with Halston. Left the party about 4:00 went to Liza's room. She was wearing a really beautiful see-through fabric dress with her hair brushed back like her mother used to wear it-that is the way she wears it in ""The Owl and the Pussycat."" It was a wig but I could not tell. Then Halston and I left Liza's room and we began taking everybody's shoes from in front of their doors and moving them to other places. The funniest thing I ever did. Then to bed and read a little bit more of the Martha Mitchell book."
"Monday, July 23, 1984","[Antony Radziwill, John Kennedy, Robert Hayes, Timothy Hutton]",0.158974358974359,Cabbed to meet Lidija ($6.50). And all the gym equipment had been moved out over the weekend so we just had the bare essentials left at 860. I packed some boxes and that tires me more than anything more than doing ten paintings. Because it is emotional. The big news came about Robert Hayes and I did not want to think about it. The kids at Interview were all upset. Fred says we have to do a page on him but I just do not know if that is a good idea. But Fred says we have to. Walked over to Private Eyes and started talking to John-John Kennedy and he is so big and handsome now. Then this kid started taking pictures and John-John said it would be okay if it was not too obvious but then it was obvious so John-John walked away. So many pretty people. Timothy Hutton came in and that was so exciting and Antony Radziwill. It was a party for the Cars.

He says Truman is checked into a private hospital room in the same building as my dentist Dr. Lyons at 115 East 61st Street but that nobody knows it. Truman's upset because everybody's saying he is washed up. Bob said that on the morning of The Stanley Siegel Show he dropped Truman off there himself and he was fine so he thinks Truman must have taken a Thorazine or something. Truman says he does not remember anything about the show. I keep trying to get it out of him if Truman is writing the Answered Prayers book or not and he will not say yes or no. C.Z. Guest sent her husband over yesterday Bob MacBride said to try to convince Truman to go to a hospital in Minnesota. I did not know if he wanted me to give him advice or what. I did not know what to tell him so I just said ""If Truman goes to the hospital when you go to visit him try to get me in."" I will tape it. Because you can not stop people-if he is going to kill himself he is going to do it."

And he is following Al around and telling him what to do and driving him crazy. And Al says ""Call Vincent"" and Paul says ""Listen I own half this property."" And now Paul wants me to sign a new piece of paper-he is decided that the one he drew up with his lawyers and made me sign is too advantageous to me or something. I told him ""No forget it I am not signing anything more."" All these years Paul made such stupid deals for us with other people and now here he is trying to be so ""shrewd"" in business with me putting all this energy into that as if I did not give him better deals than anybody else all the time anyway for all those years."

Called Nena at the hospital talked to her doctor they said the operation is in the morning and it will be intensive care for two days afterwards. This girl from Santa Fe came by the office she used to work at Interview. I can not remember her name. One of those girls like from Aspen who look deep inside you and want to know your real true meaning. She reminded me of the kind of girl that would always be visiting Jed from California that type. And she was after Agosto and I got dead serious and told him to go in the back and not come to the front until she was gone. I mean I am not going to let her ruin his life by looking for meaning in it! She left a note for him with her number on it and I destroyed it I did not tell him about it. I am not going to let her start trouble. And I kept running into Doria Reagan in her muumuu and I think I kept asking her if it was a Perry Ellis. I was nervous about the fashion show that I was supposed to model in at Studio 54 at 9:30 so I was drinking coffee all day and trying to be thin. Cabbed to Studio 54 ($4) and could not find the back door but a black bum found us ($.50). Inside there were twenty-five raving models and me and they all had big baskets and tight underwear. I talked to Michael Holden and told him I could not believe he was not a movie star yet but it did not come out right because I was nervous. I had to go out twice. I was numbers 33 and 49. And then afterwards Chris criticized my modeling saying that since I am older I should walk proud and show who I am and not be shy and keep my head down but I think I have to figure out a way to be more of a buffoon to fall down or something. Then we went to a party at Heartbreak (cab $8). Chris and Peter were fighting because Chris wanted Peter to pick up a model and he did not. In the cab going home I was scared because it was a big black driver and there was no picture on the license. Got home and called Jon to tell him about my modeling experience. He was in bed in L.A.

But who knows maybe it is Jack's and he will marry her. she is very pretty."

She said the reason we lost the war in Vietnam is sugar and that everywhere Americans go they bring Coca-Cola and fake orange drinks and then take the good rice and de-rice it. And it did make sense so I am going to try not to eat so much sugar. The Donahue Show was on the flasher problem. This is a big important new problem right? Men who flash. A wife and her husband who flashed were on they were in the dark and businessmen and lawyers who flashed. At the office Arma Andon from CBS called and invited me to dinner at the Russian Tea Room and then on to see Eddie Money at Trax. Then after I said yes Vincent told me that I had an early dinner for the North American Watch thing at the Pierre. And they usually do not take long there is speeches and it is over quickly so I thought I could do both. Worked then dropped Rupert (cab $5). Glued myself and walked to the Pierre. Walter Cronkite was going in with his wife he was the head speaker he is on vacation from the news now. Gerry Grinberg met me and put me next to a girl who had to know who I was I mean my place card was there and everything but she was saying things as if I were Truman Capote like ""I still use your list from the Black and White Masked Ball for invitations."" So either she thought I was Truman or she thought the Black and White party was mine. And I always hate to make a person wrong so I tried to change the subject but she kept going back to it. Then it was 9:30 and by this time I was supposed to be at the Russian Tea Room. But then Walter Cronkite started to talk and it was so interesting. He told a Rolex story about how the Rolex guy gave him a watch and he went to interview President Johnson and all of a sudden Johnson was looking at his wrist and said ""That damn guy said that only presidents get that watch."" And then after that that is all Johnson could think about and he could not answer any questions. Finally at 11:00 I was able to slip away. Because the thing was I was right up front and I just could not leave before that. Outside I could not get a cab so I ran all the way to the Russian Tea Room and I almost had a heart attack and then when I got there the man said they would already left but I was glad when I heard ""they"" it meant Arma had somebody with him probably Fred who I would sent because I thought I might be a little late. So cabbed to Trax ($3) which I could not find and I walked all over and finally found it. Don Mahoney Eddie Money's brother who is a cop came out and introduced Eddie and the brother is so good-looking I really liked him. Then Eddie Money sang and he is just great like a singing John McEnroe. And he is so familiar like somebody from Max's that type I just feel like we know him I think. Vitas was there and Richard Weisman. And I just know Vitas dyes his hair and sets it in rollers he thinks he is losing it the look. Then we met Eddie Money and he was cute he said he was rooting for me at Columbus Hospital in '68 when I was shot because he was a cop then at the precinct right around the corner. Then Fred was tired he would come in that morning on the Concorde."

And a Daily News guy was there covering it so we will see the angle he takes. There were two dishes that said ""Archie"" and ""Amos"" but I had not brought them I just wanted to take photos for the Party book. Peter's wife Jane Trapnell does the costumes on Kate & Allie the TV show so Jane Curtin had her dog there. Walked around Peter's office which is really big he has building models and fabric samples all over the place and he must have about forty people working for him. And Jed's decorating business is doing good too-he is billing millions."

For Madonna's wedding. I guess they want to be able to bring people home and I guess you can not at the Bel Air. I went to see Dr. Li and she took everything out of my pockets and tested the phone numbers that I had there for black magic. She does do that stuff. She puts your hand on your chest and you see if the energy is there. You put your arm out in front of you and she tests for resistance-you are lying there like a horizontal Hitler youth. Last week she took the stuff out and it was the same stuff I always carry. Two keys stuff from Japan that John and Kimiko Powers gave me and some phone numbers. Went over to Cafe Luxembourg (cab $4). Carl Bernstein was there and waved across the room. He was with three girls. And David Byrne the Talking Head was there but I never know how to talk to him. Martin Burgoyne was with us and he put his hair up and looks like a girl. he is twenty-one but he looks jaded. And Keith said that when Madonna was staying at Keith's sleeping on his couch the stories he could write about the people she had sex with...

It was so great so good to see good American TV again. Then I walked around passing out Interviews and that was great to do again too. I walked around midtown and then up toward the Pierre Hotel where the North American Watch Company was having Ronald Reagan speak at lunch. I was meeting Vincent there. I thought I was early so I stopped in Tiffany's. I thought they would have cocktails for an hour first and then start about 1:00 but it turned out they got right to it so when I arrived at 12:5 5 Vincent was pacing and we went in. Barbara Sullivan from the watch company was sweet she introduced me to Ronald Reagan as ""Andy Warhol the artist."" But the photographers were behind us so they did not get any pictures. Right next to Ronald Reagan was Harry Platt the president of Tiffany's and so I told him that the reason I was late was because I was shopping at Tiffany's. And he loved that. I was on a diet so I just had steaks. Art Buchwald gave a speech and he is really funny he should be on TV. And then Ronald Reagan gave a speech and the Republicans are going to play it cool and let the Democrats fight it out among themselves and then Teddy Kennedy will probably take over. Ronald Reagan looks absolutely great if he is sixty-nine. He called Governor Jerry Brown ""flaky."" What does ""flaky"" mean? Then they whisked him off the stage and he did not mingle and I think that is terrible. I worked till about 7:30 and then dropped Rupert ($4). I called Barbara Allen and asked if she wanted to be my date and she said she was free. So at 8:30 we cabbed to Le Club ($4). When we walked in Vitas was not so thrilled he is been cold since the article on him in Interview came out because of the picture of him with no shirt with his arms around a guy. Barbara was wearing somebody's pajamas but it looked good. she is moving to California she said. She showed me a necklace from Cartier that Bill Paley gave her a gold one and she says all these guys like Gianni Agnelli and Bill Paley are in love with her. Oh and there are so many Arabs in London. If only we could get Arab portraits to do. They have not really come to America yet but they are all over England. And they are filthy rich-if only we could get started on that."

And Chris just called me up to talk about the service saying that it was all a fantasy and why did not Robert's old boyfriends get up there and talk. He said he should have worn a black veil and gotten up there and said he was the first Mrs. Hayes. I told him that eulogies are always a fantasy but that that is what you do. I think he must be nervous too though about Robert dying. I think we are going to have to do something for this disease though. I mean like a benefit because it is like polio or something. I mean they do not know that it is sexually transmitted for sure-it is just a virus! Chris is so outrageous though. After getting months of free lessons from Lidija by being with me when she needed a photo for the ad she wants to run he said it would cost her $750! At 4:00 we went over to 22nd and Park to the church for the service for Robert Hayes and the place was completely filled.

"Monday, July 8, 1985","[Dennis Hopper, Henry Geldzahler, Herb Ritts, Sylvia Miles]",0.029542131844763425,I forgot to say that over the weekend I saw an old Naked City episode from the sixties on TV that had Sylvia Miles and Dennis Hopper and it was during the filming of this episode that I met Dennis when Henry Geldzahler took me up to 128th Street on the East Side where they were shooting it and I guess Sylvia must have been there too but I did not know her then. And she was playing old whores already. Fred was just back from L.A. and we may be getting the building off Doheny and Melrose for our Interview office out there. it is a house but it is zoned for business. Down from a million to $500000. And he would said at first that it did not need work but now he said that it needs air conditioning and wiring. Dr. Bernsohn told me that Jon is going to Tibet with Dr. Reese-for his health maybe I guess. And to research his scripts on crystals I guess. I do not know ... he is completely gone from New York now. he is just working out there in L.A. I guess I will find someone better to work on movie projects with. I mean that was the main reason I got so involved with him so ... Anyway Dr. Bernsohn said he would been to Sedona Arizona that and his back was cured. I did not know anything was still wrong with it. Sedona is one of the three big points. The others are the pyramids and the the Bermuda Triangle. Went and looked at the September Movies issue of Interview that they are working on and I did not like the illuminated manuscript kind of lettering that heads each category-I think they should have just done a new kind of modern type not the curlicue look. And the Stallone pictures that Herb Ritts took do not look any different than movie stills there is nothing that makes them unique because Stallone's just in his boxing trunks. Why did not Ritts at least have him hold a hanky in one shot or something to establish that it was our picture not just some still from Rocky IV.

Marc's arranged it so that the catalogue cover he is designing will be my painting and then the Trumps would wind up with this painting of their building. it is a great idea is not it? Ronnie's going off to Basel to show his work at an art fair with Lucio Amelio. I was taping Maura for dialogue for a Broadway show I want to do called Runaway so we went to the building where her two boyfriends live and it is the most incredible place it gave me ideas. it is unbelievable-sixty different rock bands are all in this one building and some nutty guy owns it. We went up three floors and I asked the boys to show me some other rooms in the building and so they would knock on a door and say something like ""What do you groove in?"" and they would say ""we are the Spikes"" and then another door and it would be ""Bongo and the Bears."" They all pay $480 a month for a really small place. I am going to go back there and really study the building. Runaway can be in this building and it will be the story of who the girl chooses a love story. it is such a crazy place you are in the hallway and there is nothing but noise. The bi boyfriend said that he would dump Maura if I could get him David Bowie and I said I would try. Maura lives at Louise Westergaard's who produces with Sondra Gilman-she takes care of the kids and in return she gets to live there. And she had to get up early in the morning to get them off to school so we went home. The straight boyfriend asked Maura if it was okay to go home with her and she said yes. They kiss every minute and they kiss beautifully with their hands."

Like at 1:00 he is going to go bother Warren Beatty at the Carlyle at 3:00 he is going to make a nuisance call to Woody Allen then at 8:00 he has the Emmys to attend where he will stand behind the police lines and scream at Celeste Holm on her way in things like that. I gave him $.25 to call Brigid at the office and divert him away from me. I just do not know what to send Leo for the show he is doing. Anything I send it will just look like the stuff by the kids who're making it that way now only they do it better than me. So nobody will even want to copy it. And Jean Michel Basquiat said he got a huge bill-like maybe I think $100000-from his dealer in L.A. Gagosian for his stay there when he was living so high.
"Monday, June 11, 1979",[John Wayne],0.0,As I was talking on the phone to Brigid they said on TV that they might come on with a news bulletin but then they did not and then later on the regular news they said that John Wayne died.
"Monday, June 11, 1984",[Robert Hayes],-0.13032407407407406,The air conditioning at home was broken and the plumbing and the TV all at the same time. And we found out why the house is so hot-the heat's been coming up all during this heat wave! I talked to Rupert and he went to another doctor who said his heart is not leaking that there was nothing wrong with it. And I just can not face calling Robert Hayes. I just can not.... Look I called Henry Post and we talked and then he was dead and I do not know what it means it is too abstract. I just can not do it. And I was never really friends too much with him anyway. I mean it would be different if it were Christopher or something. PH called in the afternoon and said it looks like we will be doing our book on parties for Crown half pictures half text.
"Monday, June 13, 1983",[Eddie Murphy],-0.011111111111111117,Eddie Murphy's person called and said he turned us down for the cover. I wonder if this is all on purpose. Is Rolling Stone putting the word out? Well I will remember. An old dog never forgets.

Jay Shriver's a good worker though and you can trust him. Richard Weisman called and said that Margaret Trudeau was in town and would I like to have dinner. Jon called and I invited him and he said it would be fun to meet Margaret Trudeau. Went to meet everyone at George Martin's restaurant at 9:10. Margaret arrived and she was a little heavier. I think she should go back to her thin look because now she looks a little older. She was with Bruce Nevins who used to say he would give us Perrier ads but he did not. And George Martin came over and it was so exciting he introduced me to Rick Cerone who said ""I want you to do my portrait."" He was really nice. Bianca was there too and finally for once Jon was not complaining that he had to go home to work. So finally I said that I was tired and had to rest so we left."

Fame shit and I cleaned it up so that was a good scene and then we walked to 27th Street looking for stores and there were two guys standing there and one said ""I took pictures of you and Brooke Shields"" and the other one said under his breath (laughs) ""Cocksucker."" It was really good. I do not know if he really knew me or what but there is a lot of color out there on the street. Keith had a limo and I decided to go with him to the Carlyle for a party for the Ellis kid who wrote Less Than Zero. He graduated from Bennington. And as we were going in a bald girl with a fashionable ugly dress was going in. I wonder if regular nonfashion clothes are out forever if these kids will ever dress normally like you know Phil Donahue again. It was such a cute party. I never read his book but someone sent it to me. All the kids had the right fashionable hair and the fashionable right clothes. And I always think California kids are tall but these kids were all three feet. Nick Rhodes called from London and said to call him when I got there and Julie Anne is expecting the baby in August. He said ""we are expecting a piece of sculpture."""

With Bianca sitting right there he asks me ""When is Jerry Hall's cover coming out?"" Walked on the King's Road. Fred was hawking trying to sell Bianca's autograph and mine for 50p but no one was interested. Bianca got very embarrassed. At the Turf Club Ball Fred evidently flipped out-he started crying about the passing of the nineteenth century-how there were so many beautiful things done in it and how the people who did it were now all gone-and a girl took him into a room alone. I was upstairs with Bianca. Later we found out that Fred stopped in a bar on the way home and met five Scots and they ended up stealing his shoes from outside his door."

I had an appointment to meet Richard Gere for lunch (cab $5.10). Barbara Allen was the first to arrive and then Richard Gere and Silvinha and the wife of Taki Theodoracopulos that he is not really married to yet. Barbara's trying to arrange a surprise wedding for Taki-have him come over and have a justice of the peace there to marry them. But I thought that Barbara was going with Taki having an affair with him so I do not know how she got to be such good friends with his girlfriend. Oh and also at the lunch was the psychedelic artist Mati Klarwein. The Japanese guy from Studio Voice was there and he really is just crazy about me. He wanted me to give him a new name so I gave him ""Chuck Roast."" Went to Cote Basque for dinner. I was meeting the commissioner there because I had to talk to him about doing more posters for the city more ideas. I had a lot of ideas but they were not (laughs) so good. They sounded better when we were drunk-like a gold pencil sharpener. I think it is been done already. And Brooke Hayward was at Cote Basque with Philip Johnson. We stayed a little bit talking to her and nobody brought up the terrible TV movie of her Haywire book. Sean McKeon came down. he is a Wilhemina model."

"Monday, June 20, 1977","[Bobby De Niro, Julia Scorsese]",0.14524460878627546,"I called the doctor and he said to come by at 12:00. I was late because I was nervous. It was good news it was not what they thought it might be. But now my neck is swollen and it hurts I guess I should not have had it done. Right after the doctor's office I went to church to thank God. Then I went to Tony the florist to send flowers to Liza and Julia for the fun time on Saturday. I wanted to buy this one tree that looked beautiful and at first they said they would not sell it to me because it would only live one more day but I said that was all it had to do-I knew Julia and Liza would not be in town long. Cabbed downtown and then walked to office ($3.50). Julia Scorsese called to say thanks for the wonderful tree she said it was their most memorable evening too. She invited me to go up to their room after the New York New York screening. Picked Catherine up and her brother and the three of us went to the Ziegfeld ($2.75). Sat up front. Catherine and Valentine thought the movie was boring but I liked it thought it was one of Liza's best movies. Bobby De Niro's wife is in it. She sang a song and looked beautiful but it did not belong in the movie had nothing to do with it. Went to the Sherry and the party was jammed. Every time we wanted to leave Julia said to stay. She was saying things like ""Please be Martin's best boyfriend because he does not have friends."" Somewhere in his New York days Martin must have gotten something into his head about me because it seems to mean something big to have me there and be together it is like it symbolizes something but I can not figure out exactly what yet. we would told a friend of Valentine's to meet us at the party but he never showed up so we took a cab to the Stanhope to find him ($2.50). Room 15-something. We knocked on the door and he said ""I will be there in a minute."" This went on for a while. The room is 2' X 2''. Valentine was getting so nervous he was beating his head. We decided to leave. The friend never made it to the door (cab $3 dropoffs)."
"Monday, June 20, 1983",[Timothy Hutton],0.2,Timothy Hutton stood up the photographer and stylist for his Interview cover. He just left them waiting which I was surprised about so that upset us. He called later and said he would had an earache and that they could do the cover in L.A. I guess when you get that successful at twenty-one ...

Chris had his car and we went over to Couri Hay's party for Cornelia Guest a barbecue on West 81st Street. And Cornelia's coming-out party the other night that I did not go to made The New York Times. I should have gone. And Cornelia's gotten so fat she looks like the Pillsbury Dough Boy. As we were walking between Amsterdam and Broadway there was a woman walking with two dobermans and a man carrying a wrench. And Bob Colacello has a life of his own now. I never see him after work anymore. Is he doing great things? Is he having fun? Talked to Jon in California and he was going to stay an extra day because he is trying to move from media relations into production.

I should not let these things happen to me but ... And my weight loss is still scary. I mean I like being thin but it is scary. Got a call from Jon and he apologized for not coming over and said that maybe we could work things out. We made a dinner date. He came over and we had a serious talk. He was in his running suit. We went to Le Relais and they did not mind that he was dressed that way. We sat down next to Edmund Gaultney. Then Rita Lachman came over with a Xerox of her invitation to the Prince Charles-Lady Diana wedding. Bob said she keeps the original in a vault. I just know they are going to disinvite her-say it was a mistake or something (dinner $59). If you do not drink meals are so cheap. I had an interesting talk with Jon. He said that I was not a serious enough person that whenever he would say something significant I would make a light comment. So I will have to try to be more serious. We talked about the movie business. He hates being caught between Barry Diller and the other boss. I am having a vaporizer on all the time now I really think it is helping my skin.
"Monday, June 23, 1980",[Jane Pauley],0.0790719696969697,"Got up at 8:00 and watched the Today Show. The new girl is too pretty I like Jane Pauley better. she is off getting married to the ""Doonesbury"" Trudeau guy who won a portrait by me in a society contest and we kept stalling him and finally he came up and he wore a hat and scarf and I just did a little nothing portrait because I did not realize who he was. And I screamed at Ronnie because he got three forty-five-minute phone calls."
"Monday, June 23, 1986","[Brooks Jackson, Doc Cox]",-0.044961519961519945,Fred went to Doc Cox for a blood test he believes you should know everything I do not know why. But Rosemary was not there to give it. And Iolas called from the airport and said he would be at the office in twenty minutes and he was! How could he get there that fast? And Brooks Jackson was with him and he looked really bad. I did not want to ask about his wife Adriana I hear she is dying now. The cancer. Jay gave his ticket to the premiere of American Anthem to Len the new receptionist who is seventeen and about to go to Brown so then Sam asked Len if he wanted to go with us which surprised me because he usually does not do that and Sam was shocked to find out that Len was only seventeen and that he was not the youngest kid at the office anymore. But Len is really smart for a seventeen-year-old.
"Monday, June 25, 1984","[Doc Cox, Grace Jones, Linda Li, Peter Lester, Richard Bernstein, Robert Hayes]",-0.002929292929292922,Dr. Linda Li was back in town and I had an 11:00 appointment with her. So I went over there and she would been away at a seminar or a conference so she had some new tricks. She put a lot of ball bearings on me and she hit me with hammers and it was fun. Oh and the office was so sad all empty. They even moved the coffeepot uptown to the new place and so Brigid wanted to buy another one for the transition period and I told her to go to hell. Grace Jones had called and invited me to a screening of Conan the Destroyer at 6:00 so I went (cab $4) but Grace was late so it did not start on time. Richard Bernstein was there and he made me feel terrible-he said he went to see Robert Hayes in the hospital and they all had to wear masks. And he is also been to see Peter Lester and Peter's got the kind of AIDS with spots. Richard said Robert looked terrible but that Peter Lester looked great except that he had a shirt on to cover the spots. Oh and I had to call Doc Cox's office to find out the results of my tests so finally I braced myself and decided to be brave and that if it was anything horrible I would just take it in stride. So I called and they said nothing was wrong. After all that drama they made and then nothing was wrong. So I hung up feeling that health sure was wealth. So anyway Grace was just great she is a real presence. She had a big acting scene where she sees a mouse and gets hysterical which is so stupid.
"Monday, June 26, 1978","[Chris Makos, Cyrinda Foxe, David Johansen, Martha Graham]",0.1136904761904762,"Have I said that I ran into Cyrinda Foxe recently? I think she made a big mistake leaving David Johansen for the Aerosmith guy because David's going to be so big. I sent Chris Makos out for a Konica camera ($175.55)-it is a built-in flash I think it is going to be great built-in focus. Cabbed to Martha Graham's thing at Lincoln Center ($3). Martha came out and made an hour speech she must love to talk. She had on a beautiful dark green Halston with bright green underneath but the white gloves she wears to cover her hands distract. I guess Halston is probably trying to figure out what to do about that. The first number was boring but the sets were by Noguchi. Went for drinks ($10). Then back for the second number-the sets were by Noguchi again they were the best thing-but that was boring too. Drinks again this time doubles and triples ($20). Then the third number was ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" that Liza was doing. It was a good number and if she would sung it would have been better. Halston ran up on stage afterwards."
"Monday, June 27, 1977","[Barbara Allen, Jann Wenner, Nenna Eberstadt]",0.09726430976430978,Looked through the new issue of Interview. Barbara Allen really hates her cover she says it makes her look fat. Jann Wenner sent the paintings of Mick back they must have been too much money for him. Catherine was putting Interview down and we had a fight when I told her she was lazy. Nenna Eberstadt at the office sewed up Valentine's pants but then last night they split again so she did not do a good job. I made a mistake of mentioning a lisp Valentine has and he got upset because he said he went to therapy for four years to get rid of it and thought he had.
"Monday, June 27, 1983","[Fred Newman, Katy Dobbs]",0.2068181818181818,"This morning a big bridge from Greenwich Connecticut to New York broke and four cars drove off it. You know I am just not sure that people want to read interviews. Because when you read an article about somebody you find out all these things about their lives. Like the article this week in People on Jon's friend Katy Dobbs who is the editor of Muppet magazine and her boyfriend Fred Newman. But then since the sixties after years of more and more and more ""people"" in the news you still do not know anything more about people. Maybe you know more but you do not know better. Like you can live with someone and not have any idea either. So what good does all this information do you?"
"Monday, June 3, 1985","[Couri Hay, Dianne Brill, George Mulder, Linda Li, Mary Wilson, Stephen Sprouse]",-0.018913966049382717,"Benjamin picked me up and we went to the West Side to Dr. Linda Li. She told me Fantastik is poison not to use it (phone $2). Decided to stay out as long as possible because it would been a couple of days of me being cooped up and it was a beautiful day. Went to Bagel Nosh ($10) and stood in line for scrambled eggs and it was so dirty but it was okay I faced it. Wandered to 46th Street. Saw the sights. Took pictures of drunken ladies sleeping on park benches and felt that life was just so awful. And I do not know what I try to look good for. Everybody when you look at them really close is so awful-looking. So animalistic. And then it was time to go to the opening of my Reigning Queens show down on West Broadway and Greene Street. This is the show that George Mulder got together. Some one-night Dutch benefit thing. Rupert's ""wife"" picked us up in the Bentley and the missus was disgruntled. And then we got down there and parked next to Victor's limousine. Victor just got some kind of settlement from Halston. I think he had to sign a paper saying he would not talk about Halston ever but I mean what does that mean? he is happy now that he is got this wad of money but when it is gone ... And I have hit rock bottom. This show I have sunk to the bottom of the gutter. The rock bottom of the skids of the end of the line. It was like having an opening in somebody's rent-controlled apartment. I mean they had a paper covering a mirror! And they had hors d'oeuvres that I think they were making in the kitchen. And these Dutch TV people were all around. It was so lowdown and tacky. Fred was not there. he would already left did not want to face me I guess he was in shock. We found him dazed wandering along Christopher Street later on on his way up to the Ballroom for the Scavullo benefit for the church in Greenwich Village. We just ran into him on a fluke and gave him a ride. So we left there and went up to the Scavullo thing and I sat down but then Cornelia was screaming that there was a fashion show and that I was supposed to be in it so somebody grabbed me and took me to the basement and it was every famous beautiful model and the tits were flying all over the place. And I was in Stephen Sprouse and Cornelia and I got the biggest applause. And Boy George was in the audience and Marilyn and they said let us go to dinner they had a limo but I went in a cab anyway up to Mr. Chow's (cab $6). It was me and Benjamin and Boy George and Marilyn and Cornelia and Couri Hay and they all act like horrible brats-Couri screamed across the restaurant to Dianne Brill ""Get your pussy over here"" and this is a place with just regular people and then Cornelia would say to somebody who'd told them to please be quiet ""You look like a dried duck"" or something like that. Just awful. And then Marilyn saw Mary Wilson sitting at a table and went over and Benjamin just collapsed because she is his favorite singer and then she came over and thanked me for going to her comeback concert a few years ago (dinner $400). And Boy George and Marilyn like me I think because they can say mean things and then I am not quick enough to think of a comeback so I am not a threat to them."

Because Fred's been telling me not to take out the wrinkles and everything too much on these old people that it is nice to leave some in. So the man from Munich had red veins but I made them black and I gave him bright clothes colors whereas he underplays his clothes. I made his daughter really beautiful though really elegant. And Fred was really nervous when the man was looking at them because he felt responsible for the look. The guy was cute though really nice. Stephen Mueller and Ronnie were there stretching. Robyn was trying to sell a portfolio to two ladies he would picked up the night before and he sold one print at a discount and he was thrilled. I was at the office till 7:00. Cabbed ($2.10) to 76th Street and Fifth to Leonard Stern's. he is the Hartz-Mountain guy. He just got the house and it was not air-conditioned and it was odd meeting him at 8:00 because it was not for dinner although we would thought it was going to be. He wants two very big Flower paintings for two walls and he wants them by September 16th because he is having a party then. He just left his wife. she is keeping the house on Park in the 70s which he renovated eight years ago. It was embarrassing because I called him Mr. Stein and Fred called him Mr. Stein too. When he was finished with us we went around the corner and decided to stop in at Barbara Allen's on 77th Street. She had Whitney Tower there and he is put on weight he is trying to be not so skinny and crazy because he wants his grandmother who is a Whitney to give him some dough. You know these rich kids go and say ""Oh Granny darling it costs money to get married and have children and do all the things you would like to see me do."""

People really know me now they think I am the regular newspaperman (cab $3.50). Worked till 6:40 then went home (cab $3.50) and glued myself and went to the Carlyle (cab $2.25) to pick up Jerry Hall to take her to the dinner Hoveyda was giving for the Shah's brother way down at Windows on the World. Mick opened the door. I thought he would not be there. He was on his way up to Woodstock. I asked him if it was true that he would bought 200 acres up there and he said no that he was just living upstairs from a dump. He showed me their new album and the cover looked good pull-out die-cut but they were back in drag again! is not that something? After we left the Carlyle I told Jerry I thought Mick had ruined the Love You Live cover I did for them by writing all over it-it is his handwriting and he wrote so big. The kids who buy the album would have a good piece of art if he had not spoiled it. And Stevie got it into Earl Wilson's column that Bianca was ""so touched"" by the ""Miss You"" song that she ""slowed down divorce proceedings"" but Jerry said the song was really written about her. She was wearing the same green Oscar de la Renta dress she wore the last time I went out with her and when we got into the elevator I noticed that she had underarm b.o. like she had not taken a shower before she got dressed. So I guess Mick must like b.o. I did not have a limo but she did not mind. I told Jerry that Barbara Allen had called from England where she went with Bryan Ferry. Bryan never gave Jerry her clothes back after she left him for Mick-he said he was keeping them because he knew she would come back-and after Barbara had been over there once she told Jerry she would been trying on her clothes and that did upset Jerry but she said she hopes Bryan and Barbara make it as a couple (cab $10). Down at the World Trade Center the wind was really blowing so that is when I was really noticing the b.o.... We went up to the 107th floor and our ears popped. The Secret Service was there because of the Shah's brother and Peter Beard said the waitress and the bartender were S.S. because he would heard them talking on the way in. Hoveyda really fell for Jerry making her kiss him on the lips. The food was rotten but the sunset was so beautiful. Everybody was trying to make Jerry. On the way home in a limo we picked up out front she told me her philosophy of How to Keep a Man: ""Even if you only have two seconds drop everything and give him a blow job. That way he will not really want sex with anyone else."" And then she said ""I know I can tell that to you (laughs) because you will not tell anybody."" she is so funny she says such stupid things. But then she will be able to rattle off the names of every single person she met when she was in Iran. it is what talking to Jane Forth used to be like (limo $20)."

Chris called and said that Coleco was going up ten points by the minute. He and I both have some. And I love seeing the new People magazine with Tony Perkins on the cover and it talked about him being gay as if it were all in the past. is not that funny? And it talked about Brigitte Bardot and Ingrid Bergman and Jane Fonda trying to make him. Left out Tab Hunter and Chris Makos but it did not say that he used to hire hustlers to come in through the window and pretend to be robbers. I wonder if Chris had to do that. I guess maybe he did. Chris did get wild.

The Ryan guy he was so great. Then the Donahue Show had four fairies on. Again. Sent Brigid to the bookstore to buy eight copies of Popism ($94.56). I stayed downtown and cabbed with Vincent and Shelly to Charles Maclean's party it was in Jennifer Bartlett's studio on Lafayette Street. It was a big party for English kids. Clare Hesketh the wife of Lord Hesketh said ""Oh is not Fred wonderful he stayed up until 11:00 this morning with me."" I said ""Oh really? that is very interesting. He came to work at 11:15."" Tom Wolfe was there and Evangeline Bruce and the McGraths. Oh and also Steve Aronson and he introduced me to a lot of writers."

Then got into the limo and went over to the pier building where the party was and it was the biggest party in the world-they had trees hanging and the whole place looked like Central Park but without the muggers. Elizabeth Ashley was there and she was sweet and adorable and friendly. She said she saw me at the Knicks game about a month ago. Oh and the weirdest thing. Oh this was so ridiculous. This old man comes running over to me and kisses me on both cheeks and my lips and it was just disgusting and it turned out to be Leonard Bernstein and he was carrying on everyone was looking saying he is been desperate to meet me for twenty-five years and that we had to get together and talk and that we desperately must see each other tomorrow. Really everybody was staring. And then Doc Cox came and said he wanted me to meet his new boyfriend so he took me away and then Leonard Bernstein found me again and it was more of the same and it was such a camp. I mean I remember in Pittsburgh this friend of mine saying a queer conductor was in town trying to pick up boys and that was the first I heard of Leonard Bernstein. And he was hugging me and kissing me more then putting me down at the same time. Like he would say a big compliment and then the next sentence would be a put-down. Things like ""I always wanted to meet you but everyone told me you are a creep."" Things like that. I finally got away from him."

And the article inside was crazy. It had them asking if he was going to get a sex-change operation and he said no. The cover should have had more blue. I gave them some in the style of the Fonda cover I did for Time once but they wanted this style. Jean Michel Basquiat came by he is back from Hawaii and he brought a rent check which was a good surprise. Vincent came down. Everybody was trying to get tickets to the Hard Rock Cafe that place that Dan Aykroyd has something to do with. Rock Brynner is running it. Eddie Murphy was supposed to be there. And I did not tell the Diary that Michael Sklar died did I? When I stopped in at Jean's to look at a brooch this guy there who follows my career showed me the obituary. About two days ago he died. It said he starred in Andy Warhol's Trash and L'Amour. It said he died of lymphoma. So is that AIDS? But gee Michael did not carry on. He was a hard worker.

But all I could look at was the way Ken Harrison was holding his glass. Because I have nude pictures of him with Victor. And Fred said what was wrong with Halston's party was that it looked like the funny restaurant that you walk into when you are out of town in some city and you find it on top of a building-that is what Halston's office place looks like all the mirrors. I spent most of the party out in the hallway because I could not find Catherine. Someday somebody is going to walk smack into a mirror there. The mirrors are what made the party seem so full. Cabbed down to Chembank ($4) and then walked over to the office where Mr. and Mrs. Carimati were coming for lunch. Bob is staying longer at the office these days because Kevin's out of the picture now so I dropped him and Catherine off (cab $3.50). Then Charlotte Ford called me and invited me to a party for her book at some restaurant on 58th and Third and that sounded like work so I invited Bob. The party was at 7:00 but we did not get there until 8:00 (cab $2.50). Charlotte said that it was not actually for her whole book just for the part of it that had just come out in the Ladies' Home Journal. And then a lady came over and said ""I am Mrs. Hershey and I used to work at McCall's I remember you and your drawings."" And I asked her what she was doing now and she said ""Listen I am giving this party I am the editor-in-chief of Ladies' Home Journal."" The party was a lot of squares you never see around. It was black tie and Bob and I were in black tie but Tom Armstrong was not and I am noticing that a lot of people do not come in black tie when it says to so I am giving that a lot of thought. I turned around and there was a beautiful beautiful lady near me and it turned out to be Rocky Converse and Bob was next to her husband. We had a really really good time I talked to her and Bob talked to her husband. She was married to Gary Cooper and she is the mother of Maria Cooper Janis. She said she does not believe in the mystic ESP stuff that her daughter does though. She said her husband's had three heart attacks but that he is still the best plastic surgeon in town and that he was going to die with his boots on. She said that Pat Buckley told her she should wear her hair pulled back and she pulled it back and she looked beautiful. It was like looking at Joan Crawford."

The reviews came from England and they were bad for Bad. Stupid people like Frank Rich can write four pages on some nothing movie but about Bad they just describe what it is and leave it at that. do not they know what their job is? To say what something means? I read the reviews and it sounds like the censors did not take out the baby being thrown out the window the way they threatened they were going to. Ahmet and Mica Ertegun called to invite me to dinner at Gallagher's that night for the Traamps a thirteen-member black group on Atlantic that was going to be playing at Roseland. So we went there and the best thing at Roseland was a girl with real gold-like 14K-fingernails that you buy and she got my number so she is going to call to get interviewed in Interview. she is a famous singer.
"Monday, March 14, 1983",[Ron Feldman],-0.08505017709563166,"I went to 47th Street to see Boris who has not had anything new in so long he was crying poor. Nobody's buying and nobody's selling for some strange reason. And no auctions either. Rupert called and said Ron Feldman wanted me to come right down to the gallery on Greene Street and sign prints. I said to tell him to fuck off that I would be down when I felt like it. And then Ron called himself and said that he would give me my check if I came down and then I felt like it. He said he would send someone for me because I said I did not want to go down alone so Rupert came up in a cab for me-I would thought he was going to send a limo. So I went down there and Ron took me into his office and said ""And now we are going to talk about sheets and pillowcases."" I said ""No. we are not."" I said ""Well sonny I have turned down millions of dollars in deals for sheets and pillowcases and I am not going to do it for you"" I left with Robert who works for Rupert (cab $5)."

And Brigid was back at work and it was wonderful she was radiant and God she really has a beautiful gallbladder scar you can hardly see the staple marks. We sat at the conference table for an hour and she told me everything about the gallbladder attack and operation.

I called the hospitals and they did not have a Frowick or anything there. I wonder what is wrong with him. It was rainy in the morning and not cold but by the end of the day it was below zero. Mrs. de Menil and Mrs. Pompidou came down to the office there were about six security people ahead of her and six people with her. she is tall and beautiful. And Mrs. Malraux was with them. I do not know if she was the widow or a daughter-in-law or what. I gave everybody Philosophy books. And Mrs. de Menil is so skinny. she is building a museum in Houston but she said to keep it a secret. Madame Pompidou only stayed ten minutes and then she went off-I did not find out till later in the day that where she went off to was to see Nixon. And she said ""I saw your white hair from the Reagan box last night."" she is part of the inner circle. I waited at the office until it was time to go to Mrs. de Menil's (cab $4). Then Arman and his wife Corice were giving a dinner party afterwards for Madame Pompidou."

We watched the Match Game and it was a fast round where the answer was ""Andy Warhol"" and one person was guessing ""Peter Max"" and then ""Soup Can"" and then ""Pop Artist."" Our breakfast was cancelled at the White House. I guess the Carter administration does not want to see us anymore because I did the Ted Kennedy poster. But we were glad we did not have to get up so early to be over there at 7:30. We slept till 11:30. A girl came and took us to Kramerbooks it is a bookshop/coffee house and so everybody was drinking. Bob loves the place because it is where he picked kids up when he was at Georgetown. People were shoving everything at me to sign and I signed it all-underwear a knife. Oh (laughs) and I signed a baby. We had to get the shuttle at 9:00 (tickets $153). Bought some newspapers and a Newsweek ($2). And Newsweek had a great review of Popism. And I forgot to say that at the bookstore in Washington Sargent Shriver went out of his way to come by and say hello. He used to be so handsome. And oh God it is just so hard to talk to old ladies like I have to sometimes-they are so old and their teeth are crooked and all you see is their mouths and it is just so hard to stand it and I guess that is about all the philosophy for now. Went to bed had a glass of wine fell asleep."
"Monday, March 18, 1985",[Joan Hackett],0.13510802469135805,I am getting more nervous by the minute about being on The Love Boat. It turns out I am going to be there for ten days. Now that Jon's working in L.A. most of the time he is buying Joan Hackett's old house on Angelo Drive in Benedict Canyon. it is cheap for Beverly Hills only $100000 next to really expensive ones-Jon said the son of Charles Bludhorn the chairman of Gulf + Western got one on the same block for $1.2 million. Time magazine sent down the Iacocca picture and if I can only make a great portrait out of this picture then I could get a lot of corporation presidents. If they use it they have to pay a lot but if they do not use it they just pay a little bit.
"Monday, March 19, 1979",[Martha Graham],-0.04023692810457517,Halston picked me up and we went over to Martha Graham's studio on I think 63rd to watch her rehearse. Martha arrived and she is so great so young. She has a guy who looks after her. Then we went over to Halston's for dinner. Martha's going to England to do a command performance and to Egypt and to Lisbon. Her Iranian performance was cancelled naturally but I do not see how she can do it at her age it is so hard traveling like that. We talked about cosmetic surgery. I remember somebody telling me once that when Martha was down and out a kind couple took her in and gave her a facelift and then her career revived. Now maybe she will get a hand operation too she said because really her hands are just like little stumps. I told her I saw her dance in Pittsburgh in 1948 and she said she was from Pittsburgh and Halston was surprised he did not know that he said they would never really talked. Halston gives her clothes and somebody else gave her money to redecorate but instead of redecorating she bought one expensive thing instead of doing the basics but she said it was just because she did not have time to do the basics that she will get to it. Halston served caviar and baked potatoes. And when Halston serves baked potatoes and caviar it is always with like a pound of caviar. I do not know if it is really caviar these days though because with all the trouble in Iran where can they be getting it? They may be just making it up. And the Du Pont twins called me at Halston's they were calling all over town for me and I would not take the call and then they had the nerve to ring the doorbell and they were drunk and giggling and I went to the front door and told them off. Oh and Halston's mad at Bianca because she never arrived from London and it was supposed to be Mohammed's day off and Halston had him wait at home all day and when he called her in London she said that she had food poisoning but he did not believe her because he would heard her use that excuse over and over again on other people while she was staying at his house.
"Monday, March 19, 1984",[Rosemary Kent],-0.040332304987477405,"Paloma called and we were invited that night to her dinner for her perfume. They did not send perfume to men but the bottle is kind of nice. She was having the dinner at the old Burden mansion on 91st Street that is now a Catholic school and they rent out the old ballroom for parties. Dropped Benjamin. Glued and then was late. Cabbed uptown ($3.50). And because I was late I would been bumped from the main table. So I wound up at the same table as Rosemary Kent! she is back around and working for the Post! I have been forgetting to tell the Diary. And Fred was at this table too so he was going nuts trying to look away from her. she is still with the same husband Henry. And instead of running up to Paloma I ran up to horrible Rosemary Kent who is still writing her stupid ""what is In/what is Out"" articles you know-""Handbags! Shoes! Andy Warhol's wigs!""-and tried in my heart not to think she was awful because God forgives so so should I. See I am sure I got sick the other day as punishment because I yelled at that lady. did not I tell the Diary? A real estate lady called the office and said she wanted to show our floor to some people and I screamed that she could not that our lease was not up and that she better not set one foot on the premises until it was and she said she could not believe that a nice person and an artist like me would be yelling at her. And then I got sick. Paloma's party just missed. The people were too old or something. I have decided I am just going to go to openings of stores and galleries that is my new philosophy. And the big news of the day was that Rupert's house in New Hope Pennsylvania burned down so he did not come in. A coal got caught in the chimney. I never had a priest exorcise my room that had the spontaneous fire. I blessed it myself-I got holy water. But I still think there is something funny about that room. I had the Picabia painting of the devil that fell down in there and also the ceiling fell down."
"Monday, March 2, 1981","[Andrew Fraser, Charlotte Greville]",0.08,-Paris We made a lot of phone calls to see who was in town and then we got a car and we drove out to Chateau La Hori to this dinner that Bergitte de Ganay was giving for Charlotte Greville and her husband Andrew Fraser. They were there for the hunt. This is where the hunt has gone on since the days of old. Charlotte has forty letters of introduction she can go anywhere in the world. But now somebody's trying to outlaw deer hunting in France. They actually let the dogs tear the deer apart. Or they knife them to death or something. During the ride back Fred freaked out and it was just too embarrassing. Everything was normal and then all of a sudden he was a different person for ten minutes and then he was normal again. The driver got really scared though and almost stopped the car (car $320). And then Fred was complaining that nobody ever is nice to him. Actually we both were complaining-I felt neglected too.

She said ""Nicaragua Nicaragua."" Worked in the afternoon. At 6:00 left to go to Adela Holzer's (cab $3.50). Bob was being crazy and did not want to go said she had no money. But she has a whole house 216 East 72nd Street and I liked the way it looked. She was entertaining James Coco and his boyfriend. When I got home the phone rang and it was Philip Niarchos and he wanted to come over to see my house but I did not want him to so I said I was already in bed."

I do not want to but Vincent and Fred are against me. The Knickerbocker Club is really chic really rich. I guess I made a mistake saying ""cock"" in the big room because David Whitney almost died but then he said ""fuck"" about five times. We had drinks in the dining room and then went into our own little dining room. The food was great. We had champagne and that finished me off for the rest of the day. They toasted me although I have not given my answer yet (cab $6). Interview was moving to the new building and they were complaining because they had to move in the rain. Seeing Interview move made me have to face the fact that I will have to move out of 860 soon too. But after they left seeing all that clear empty space it was just so beautiful that now I do not want to leave. With all my stuff I could probably fill up the whole new building."
"Monday, March 23, 1981",[Chris Makos],0.26640625,The story about Halston that Victor sort of just whispers in sentences that do not go together is that he is still in the hospital-something like that his ceiling is mirrored and the mirror fell on the bed and cut him and then the silver from the back of the mirror got into the wound and infected it but I do not know if Victor is fantasizing being creative. Chris Makos came at 3:00. We were photographing a madonna named Jackie with a baby such a cute little girl a really pretty baby. The madonna was like a beautiful version of Viva more like her sisters.

I had to be photographed by some ad agency and they did their whole setup and then asked me why I was so creative and I said ""I am not."" So that blew their whole thing they did not know what else to ask. Then I took the car up to Bloomingdale's. I was forty-five minutes late and they were mad. I autographed a lot of books. Then the car drove me home. It was raining. Went to La Boite to the dinner Bob organized for Popism. And there were terrible speeches by Henry Geldzahler who said I was the mirror of our times and Ahmet who said everybody loves me. Richard Gere was sweet and said he would read the book and loved it. Stallone crashed with two girlfriends and he and Bianca had a big fight because he heard her putting him down. Everybody sang ""Happy Birthday"" to John Samuels who turned twenty. And our editor Steve Aronson was there and he kept his whole table laughing."

They said it ""was not in the contract."" They wanted me to take a cab. But Fred talked to them. And when we got here since they did not have a room reserved for Fred I am wondering if they are paying for his. I think they must be. So I went to the wardrobe place and ordered a pair of Reebok shoes but I only ordered one and I should have ordered more. And the kid who came to pick me up I asked if he was trying to be an actor and he said ""Oh no I am Captain of the Cars."" He was very cute. We drove to the old Goldwyn Studios on Santa Monica near La Brea. These places are so cold you sit around freezing all day in these soundstages and it is no wonder people want to be actors because the only place it is warm is under the lights. So then I was done there and they brought me back to the hotel and then Suzanne Somers had told Doug Christmas that she just had to have lunch with us so we went to meet her at Ma Maison and then she cancelled. But Orson Welles was there at his own table and he said he wanted to meet me and I went over and he was just great really great and he is a person I would like to interview myself. And then afterwards we went to Doug's place and Roy Lichtenstein was there signing some things so that was exciting. And then Jon met us and took us to the Beverly Hills for drinks. The taxis from there to the Bel Air are expensive ($8). Got dressed and went over to Spago where Swifty Lazar was having his party for the Academy Awards. And the traffic was so bad it took so long to get over there. it is on Sunset above Tower Records. I had to sign like 800 autographs. All the press was there like Susan Mulcahy and Barbara Howar. And Cary Grant and Jimmy Stewart came and just everybody came after the awards. Faye Dunaway and Raquel Welch and just everybody."

I went out passing Interviews and I stopped in at Primavera and ran into Audrey the owner and decided she would be a good person to go around to the new places with and to learn about new categories from so we ran around town and we had fun. Audrey said that a lady brought in a Castellani and she gave her $100 and now it is worth $10000. Well that is what you do that is the antiques game. If it is an old person selling it you give them a break and give them a little more but it is like if you go to a flea market and you see something that is really worth a lot and the person selling it does not know-you do not tell them. And categories disappear. it is like Deco-you hardly ever see a Deco piece anymore. People just get them and then they put them away and they are all collected up categories go (catalogues $8). Then we were in Suzie Frankfurt's neighborhood so we rang her bell. Suzie looks good. she is in sort of a floozy look lately-her hair frizzled and pulled back on one side. And really really big shoulders. Extreme. that is how she looks best. And she looks really rich.

His father was movie star Bill Williams and his mother Barbara Hale was Della Street on Perry Mason. A good interview. Then sat in the lobby for a second and met Liv Ullmann. The place was really jumping with stars all getting ready to go to the Academy Awards. At 4:00 I went to Fred's room to photograph Willie Shoemaker the jockey. Richard Weisman's commissioned me to do a series of athletes' portraits. Richard will keep some of the portraits and some will be for sale and the athletes will get to keep some. So Willie was the first athlete. Had to get some film (cab to Schwab's $3 film $15.30-lost slip). Willie's wife called from the lobby and she came up with a girlfriend-but without Willie. He did not show up till ten after 5:00 and when he saw her he could not believe she was there. he would been in court getting a divorce from her that is why he was late. Willie's ex-wife of one hour was one of the tallest women I have ever seen. She was dressing Willie for the picture and he looked like an eight-year-old kid. And guess what he was wearing-little Jockey shorts! Ordered martinis and the wife was drinking. She kept asking him for a date to celebrate the divorce and he kept turning her down he said ""If I would known you were going to be here I would not have come."" Alana Hamilton called to invite us to an Academy Awards party at Dani Janssen's. I missed Ronee Blakley's invitation to go to the Oscars ceremony with her because I was in Fred's room.

Jack Haley said Liza was in Detroit with her show and coming back the next day. Dick Sylbert was there. Valerie Perrine told me her life story she was once a chip hustler in Las Vegas and on the verge of marrying some rich guy after eight years but he shot himself accidentally.

And everyone was complaining because the Whitney had not loaned the portrait that Alice Neel did of me for the dinner you have to give them a month's notice and I said that that was just fine with me that it was a closet painting. And Alice had a nude of herself. Her family was there. She turns these paintings out so fast. And the mayor was nice he made a cute speech one-liners. And then suddenly some creep got up and started a speech and it was Stewart Mott and it was the oddest speech. He talked about how Alice Neel had lived in the gutter for so long and did not have a pot to pee in and how she lived on like 109th Street on the East Side and then on 105th Street on the West Side and now as a present to Alice would the mayor please give his views on nuclear war and disarmament. And the mayor said something like ""Now listen here we are finished with your speech."" Bob told the mayor we wanted him for the cover of Interview and the mayor said ""After the election"" and Bob said ""Oh could not it be before?"" but the mayor said ""After'll be better.""

So we went up there to Madison Avenue (cab $4) to the Brewster Gallery. But Ted Kennedy did not show up he was in Massachusetts. It would only have been good if he was there signing too.

And she speaks perfect English except with a little British accent. She said that she just decided one day that she hated her last name and named herself Sanda I think her name has a lot to do with the mystique. Then afterward she wanted to walk in the rain so we gave her an Interview for a rain hat and she went off walking. Sharon Hammond was having a birthday party. Went over there and it was really festive. I guess everybody had been so nerved up by Reagan being assassinated but he is going to make it they were relieved. Sharon's lord was there. I heard Lester Persky talking to some other producer about Popism and he said he wanted to ""buy it"" but since it was Lester talking I did not know if he meant the film rights or just a copy of the book."

She was spotted down in Florida or Barbados with Bill Paley. One of those places. Nicky Vreeland saw them and told Diana and Diana told Bob. I was back home at 12:30 and I passed out because of the heavy rain.
"Monday, March 5, 1984",[],0.0667857142857143,I read the book about Mrs. Chairman Mao called White Boned Demon and I decided to do paintings of her. It was great about how she went from prostitute to Chairman Mao's wife. But I mean how this guy wrote this stuff I do not know. I mean going back to individual days in her childhood and remembering if she was happy or sad I mean they do not even know what happened to her mother let alone if she was unhappy on Tuesday in May 1937! The Mrs. Mao book did not have any pictures in it so now I have to find some.

Picked up Catherine and went. We had a really great time gossiping about Jamie's trip to Europe with Bo Polk and Nureyev. Andrew Stein was at the next table with his girlfriend. Catherine ordered Guinness and champagne-a black velvet. Ossie Clark came by. Tom Sullivan arrived just up from Florida where he would gone with Margaret Trudeau. She was outside in the limo. When we got to Studio 54 I thought it was just going to be about fifteen or twenty people for Liz Taylor's party but it was more like 2000 so if Halston was paying it cost a fortune. It was a good work night for me because I saw Mrs. Kaiser-Aly-and she said her face would be okay next week to have her picture taken and we talked about the Joan Crawford sale. Liz looked like a-bellybutton. Like a fat little Kewpie doll. John Warner said hello to me. Rod Gilbert was with the cutest new hockey player a blond who Catherine fell in love with the other night and she says she is going to try to get him but she does not think she is going to be able to but she is going to try. He was with a girl with big tits. And Margaret and Tom did not get much fanfare from the photographers I guess they are an old couple by now. And Bianca paid no attention to me at all but then she wanted me to dance with her so that it would be the new kind of picture for the photographers. She was wearing black and white that is the current Halston thing but she just really does not look good in his clothes. And Bianca kept telling me to call Chris Wilding over and then when he came she would act like she had not had a thing to do with it so he would look at me and say ""Yes?""-like ""What did you want?""-and I did not have a thing to say and Bianca would act disinterested and it was just so dumb. Truman Capote was there and he and Bob were dancing all night and the photographers were taking pictures. Truman looks so thin. Diana Vreeland was there and people were being brought over to Liz-she was the queen. I met a quarterback. Bob was watching Bianca take poppers and he said to Diana Vreeland ""It really becomes more like pagan Rome every day"" and she said ""I should hope so-is not that what we are after?"" The decorations were fabulous vases as big as people filled with flowers and they did a tribute to Liz with pictures on the wall. And Monique was there and we reminisced about the time I met Liz for the first time in Rome around the time we were there making Frankenstein and Dracula."

Got a letter at the office from the White House from Jimmy Carter. I wish I would talked more last month when I met him but I was so nervous. he is really nice though a really nice man. Jamie Wyeth still was painting Arnold Schwarzenegger who was still posing. Lunch for Jamie and Arnold ($16). Alex Heinrici came by to touch up something. Worked all afternoon. Picked up Bob Colacello and cabbed to 45 Sutton Place South. A book party for Anita Loos given by Arnold Weissberger. I had forgotten my tape and camera and there were lots of celebs. Arnold Weissberger and Milton Goldman have the longest-running gay marriage in New York. Arnold is seventy-something the biggest old-time show-biz lawyer and amateur photographer. He takes pictures of everyone who comes to his house. He had a book out last year called Famous Faces. He had the book on the dining table at the party and he was making the famous faces sign it next to their pictures. Milton Goldman is sixty-something and a big agent at IFA. Bob noticed that he was the only person under thirty there-barely-and I said that Arnold must be afraid to have young kids because he might lose Milton. All the butlers and bartenders were over sixty. They brought one drink at a time and the tray shaked. Paulette Goddard was there she told me that she did not sell one rug at Parke Bernet because the dealers she felt had ganged up on her. And they probably did because those rugs are great. Talked to Rosemary Harris Martha Graham Cyril Ritchard Rex Harrison Sylvia Porter. Milton introduced everyone three times. Cabbed to Elaine's ($3.25) to meet Jamie and Arnold and Rudolf Nureyev. Jamie was having a meeting of their minds. On the way in the friend of Lester Persky's who always feels me up grabbed me and introduced me to Neile McQueen and she was actually pretty. He whispered ""Ex-wife Steve McQueen"" in my ear. Arnold walked in with three little girls one of them was a sportswriter on The New York Times and she is in love with him. Then the most fascinating thing happened. A guy who Elaine introduced me to did his card tricks and it was where he flashed the deck and then said think of a card and then he guessed the card eight times! I could not get it out of my mind I thought about it all night. I have just got to know how he did it because if you can do that you can do anything. Dropped off Catherine and Uncle Erskine and Miranda ($3)."
"Monday, March 7, 1983",[],0.1875,I went to Dr. Silver the pimple doctor (cab $7) and he said I should drink more water and I will but I am not sure I like peeing a lot because then I would have to go home more because I do not like to use public bathrooms at all.

"Monday, March 9, 1981",[Jackson Pollock],0.1903720238095238,"-Munich Very sunny and very cold. Went to the gallery where they were having a little exhibition of the glittery Shoes and had to do interviews and pics for the German newspaper and then we had to go back to the hotel and be picked up by the ""2000"" people-it is a club of twenty guys who got together and they are going to buy 2000 bottles of Dom Perignon which they will put in a sealed room until the year 2000 and then open it up and drink it and so the running joke is who will be around and who will not. It was fun because all the men were really straight and it was fun being out with them. Some of them brought their wives. And it was an eight-course dinner with a lot of different wines during each course. The first food was fresh liver the goose was just killed in the kitchen and the liver was just taken out and cut into slices and warmed up-half warmed by the heat and half warmed by the goose. It was delicious but after you thought about it you wanted to throw up. The second course was soup. Then lobster with baby quail-you got the breast of the little quail as big as your fingernail. It was really good but just so sad like eating the chest of a roach. Then in between courses we had some sherbet and they made it look like Jackson Pollock because they pureed fresh kiwi and strawberries and threw them on a plate. Artistic. Then they had lamb encrusted and it was the best lamb I ever had encrusted. And the different twenty men kept changing seats so they could sit next to me because they thought they could get some good conversation but I was just absolutely drunk."
"Monday, May 10, 1982","[Ava Gardner, Debra Winger, Richard Gere]",0.3333333333333333,I was invited by Jon to see An Officer and a Gentleman with Richard Gere and Debra Winger. I can not tell if I liked it or not. Jon said he cried three times during it. Richard Gere has gotten to be a really good actor now though. And Debra Winger is a good actress but she has this nose that just misses. If she had a nose job she could look like Ava Gardner-or anything.

Bob had arranged for us to go to a dinner that Earl Blackwell and Eugenia Sheppard were setting up for the Sacklers. I got a limo and was asked to bring a girl so I picked up Barbara Allen and we went to Doubles. I had a black tie on but I should have worn black pants because I had jeans on and those waiters were all looking at me funny. It was a really heavy-duty dinner. All the right people were there. Andy Stein was there and I told him if he wanted to have really beautiful skin he should go to Janet Sartin and he told me I should go to his gym place so we are going to exchange numbers. Then over the speakers came ""Happy Birthday"" so everyone thought it was Mr. Sackler's birthday but it turned out they piped it into the wrong room by mistake. I just could not take another Taurus birthday I hate them. A little dancing. Eugenia was so cute she is a Leo and she said ""My boyfriend is a Taurus"" so I guess she and Earl are a couple. I guess it is like a mother. Well I am in that category too. Then I called Jon and Barbara Allen and I went over to his apartment on the West Side and I spent an hour counting pennies with him-he was balancing his budget-and he was rereading Popish and asking serious meaningful questions about it and I could not take it it was too dumb. Left at 1:00."

It was windy I was late walked over fast. Some girl took X-rays and could not find the dye on them so I have to go back again. And I was screaming about taking X-rays. I do not like to get them I think they give you cancer. All the Doc could think about was the party he is giving for me and Larry Rivers. George Plimpton was in the waiting room with hay fever when I went out. Paul Morrissey came down to the office. We slipped out around 10:00 and went over to Reginette's where Federico De Laurentiis was giving a wrap party for King of the Gypsies and it was the kind of party where it is all for the television to photograph thousands of people such a firetrap people jammed bright lights-they should not give parties like that it is too dangerous. And Barry Landau was with me like glue every step I would take he was right there and if I would think of a clever new step to get away from him he would still be right there. What makes a person do that? What kind of a person is it? it is so sick. Mr. Universe was there-it looked like Rome. And Eddie Albert that cute kid. Shelley Winters was drunk on the couch and she said I should buy Neon Woman for her the play Divine's in up at Hurrah's. She could really fit the part. It took half an hour to make it to the door. So dangerous.

Mickey had been calling her for months wanting her to give an interview on Max's Kansas City and the sixties for a book he was doing on Max's. Called Julian Schnabel ($.50) and then went over there. He has four floors in the building that Les Levine bought years ago and then co-op'd. Schnabel used to be his assistant. Julian's following my philosophy of doing a painting a day he is trying to be the new Andy Warhol so that made me nervous so I left and worked very hard at the office until 8:00.

Bianca said she wanted to do the Steven Spielberg interview with me. And now that I am thinking about it what made Joan Quinn look unusual was that her hair was not colored the pink and green-it was regular hair. And for once she did not ask for a painting.

The man at the volcano who would not come down must have been killed they could not find him. Gerry Ayres called and he is writing a movie called Painting-he wrote Jodie Foster's movie Foxes. he is the studio person that brought us out to Hollywood in '69. And he wanted to meet Henry Geldzahler. And so I made a lunch with Henry for Wednesday. I met Bob in front of his house and we walked to the Plaza for the JOB Ball-Just One Break-and we would missed the cocktail hour. All the old bags came out for this. Nan Kempner was there with Jerry Zipkin. Robyn's mother was very sweet. She and Bob chatted they are having the same problem-somebody is signing them up for all these magazine subscriptions and they keep coming in the mail. I sat next to Mrs. Tony Curtis. And so I said ""Oh I wish I was home watching Tony Curtis on Moviola."" And she said yes that she liked Tony a lot but that they were just breaking up. they would been married twelve years. She was nice. Sharon Hammond was there with her new beau Lord Sondes. she is gained five or six pounds and she was porking it up. And the lord has a potbelly too. I could not believe it when I saw her eat a whole roll. I took it away from her. All the old presidents of the ball got up there Sao and Chessy Patcevitch and Sharon's mother Mrs. Long and Nan and Jean Tailer and a couple of other heavy-duty ladies. They gave door prizes. Then Bob and I went to Linda Stein's party for our agent Joan Hyler. When we got to the party one of the photographers told me ""you are the biggest one here"" so that is always a letdown. Paul Morrissey was there with his two nieces and Susan Blond and Sylvia Miles and Sylvia said ""you have got to hear my songs"" and I said ""Oh yeah I can not wait."" And she said ""You do not have to-I have got them right here in my bag."" So I had Linda Stein put them on the record player and they sounded good to me but there were eight different record people there and they did not react. And then Linda came over to Paul and said ""Oh listen I mean you are the only person here who realized that I am wearing emerald earrings and have Regency furniture and Lalique and if it was not for you telling them they would think it was junk. So thank you."" Legs McNeil who started Punk magazine was there."

Cabbed ($3) to Mr. Chow's and had drinks with Diane Von Furstenberg Barry Diller and Mrs. Chow and next to my place was a place card that said ""Joan"" and I asked ""Joan who?"" and I could not believe it when they said Joan Collins. And she arrived and was wearing a fake white Halston. She said she is known Halston for years. And she did not have a line or blemish on her face. She said she did not give interviews or do Carson or anything but that she would do one for Interview. But then later Robert Hayes told me she is been on the cover of everything.

Saul Steinberg was there with his third wife Gayfryd who is so beautiful she looks like the ""Draw Me"" girl in old magazines. And Claudia's mother was there so glamorous and really beautiful whereas Claudia is just ""cute."" But it will be a while before Ron Perelman trades her in and she can help him a lot in the meantime. The party was all these old guys dancing around with their new young wives that they traded in for. And when you came in the door there was a guy holding a candle and all along the way up at intervals would be another guy with a candle and then another. And they had drinks in the Mike Todd Room and then out on the dance floor they had tables with flowers on them and each high flower had a spotlight on it and it was beautiful. Like if the flower was blue it would have a blue light and be bluer. It looked like glitter. And if it was pink it would have a pink light on it and be pinker. And there were chairs sprayed silver. Five glasses for each person. And at the Palladium the sound is really good. A big stage with a great sound system. And Peter Duchin played al night. He came over and said hello but said he was working. But I think he did stop to have dinner. Steve Rubell said the other day that Claudia was paying the Pointer Sisters $100000. They came on after the dessert and did six or eight songs. And I had the best seat right in front of them at table 7. Cornelia was at table 1 with Roy Cohn and his boyfriend who was wearing a blue tuxedo that was half leather. Boy George and Marilyn came in at the end. Cornelia and Marilyn hit it off and instead of leaving with me she went off dancing with them. The food was pretty good-Glorious Food. But they do not have the real beauties for waiters anymore. You are not knocked out. Now they have sort of the thirty-five look. Somebody else must be picking them because they used to look like Steve Rubell had hand-picked them-that look. And the Glorious Food waiters wear white gloves now I guess Glorious makes them in order to prevent the fist-fucking from spreading. it is a good idea because I spotted a friend of Victor's among them. The only glittering personality there was Geraldo Rivera."

Everything he said she contradicted. And I do not know why. And he is ended up buying a house out in Connecticut right next to Peter Brant. He plays polo like Peter. He has a good-looking face like an old fairy would be good-looking like this and he is the Joe Allen type-short and stocky with grey-black hair and I think capped teeth. He knows all the right people. And everybody says he bought his title he is a Polish baron or something. I had invited Jean Michel Basquiat as my date and I was next to him so maybe they thought it was a girl's name. Richard Gere's Silvinha moved her seat to sit next to Jean Michel Basquiat. And Jean Michel Basquiat gave me all his meat for the dogs and Silvinha did too. I am watching MTV right now. I do not know what else you can do to these videos to make them different. they are all the same. they are all like sixties underground movies people running around.

I would thought that this trip would bring some progress with Jon but it did not. he would left us to go see his family who really adore him. Oh but from now on I can not talk personally about Jon to the Diary because when I told him I did he got mad and told me not to ever do it again that if I ever put anything personal about him in the Diary he would stop seeing me. So from now on it will just be the business angle in the Diary-he will just be a person who works for Paramount Pictures who I am trying to do scripts and movies with. I gave a tip to the airplane driver ($100). And tipped the limousine driver ($20). Got a call from Tina Chow inviting me to a party for David Bailey and his wife Marie. It turned out it was actually a big party. Marie is really beautiful she had on one of those slit dresses. Eric Boman and Peter Schlesinger were there. I told everybody how I was a male model now I was trying to hustle work.

And did I say that the other day Senator Kennedy called me at the office and I could not get him off the phone and I did not know what to talk to him about. I guess he did not have anything to do. But Fred was explaining why he is stayed in the race-to raise money for the Democratic pot. His Smith sister called me the other day but I did not take the call I knew it would be to want me to give a donation for something. Did I remember to say that at the Empire Strikes Back movie there was a black kid about fifteen or sixteen sucking his thumb in the row ahead of me with his parents? I do not think he was retarded. He did not look retarded.

When we walked in there was the number-one bestseller Fran Lebowitz sitting with Lisa Robinson. One Fifth is pretty-bright and chintzy. Patti did not want to eat too much so she ate half my lunch. She said she only loves blonds and that she wanted to have an affair with a blond. All I could think about was her b.o.-she would not be bad-looking if she would wash up and glue herself together a little better. she is still skinny. she is with a gallery now doing drawings and writing poetry. The Robert Miller Gallery. She had a baby she said-that is why she originally left New Jersey and she said that the baby was adopted on Rittenhouse Square. She called it ""it"" and David asked her what ""it"" was and she said a girl. She reminds me a lot of Ivy-everything was put on. She said she was in Italy the day Moro was kidnapped and that she and Moro were the big things on Italian TV that day. She said she did not take drugs in the sixties that she would only started recently and just for work. Anyway I missed my girl-lunch with David I did not get any gossip (lunch $35). Patti lives over One Fifth and so she went upstairs and David and I walked over to Mays to get some supplies for the office ($32.89 $2.79). I got tired from walking in the sun.

And Julian Schnabel's painting just went for $96000 at auction. Clemente is another one of those new Italian painters like Chia and Cucci. And somehow Julian is in this category too-he really is determined to be a big star. Later I was getting calls from Victor and he was crying and hysterical and saying he had no friends and that when Halston came home ""something"" was going to happen at 6:00. And I said ""Oh Victor I mean I just do not want to be involved because the last time I was involved you told me to mind my own business. Just do not do anything crazy."" And he said that he would drag Halston's name through the papers and ruin his image and I said that he would be the one who got hurt. And I think this is all because Victor's new boyfriend just jilted him and people transfer these things."

And he would sent me a note last week-Vincent did not open it I did-that said: ""Beware of May 5 it is Live or Die."" he is been hallucinating a theory that I stole Mick Jagger's song ""Miss You"" from him and gave it to Mick Jagger to record. I do not know what he is talking about ... I do not even know if this kid really writes songs. he is ... disturbed. So after Janet Sartin I went to Sporting World to buy a hat to disguise myself. I got a camouflage hunter's hat ($27). Made phone calls ($2). Called Jon to tell him someone was threatening my life and when I finally got him (laughs) he did not care. People were still asking for autographs though so I bought more disguises ($15.74) and then cabbed to Park and 18th ($5.50). Robyn was waiting for me there. A Detective Rooney or something like that from the NYPD came over. And Risa Dickstein she is Interview's lawyer said she has a detective we can hire but I am going to hire Agosto to be my bodyguard and go places with me. Anyway I wrapped some presents and then was picked up by Jon Gould and we went to La Grenouille to meet Chris Makos and Peter Wise (cab $6). The place was crowded with funny Miami Beach people. We got an up-front table. And all the other people in the restaurant were jealous because we were having so much fun they wanted to join the party. we would brought gifts for each other and we were opening our gifts. For dessert we ordered two souffles and champagne. And money is the best gift so I gave Jon and Peter each $100 in one-dollar bills. And I also gave Peter $25 rolls of pennies which were so heavy. And Jon I gave $80 of Susan B. Anthony dollars. Jon gave Peter a teapot and a big mixing bowl. I gave them all silver clothespins for their letters. We were there till about midnight having a good time and we were blowing bubbles and Marcel the captain got a little mad at that (dinner $400)."
"Monday, May 5, 1986","[Peter Beard, Sylvia Miles]",0.029166666666666664,Cabbed to the office ($6) and it was really busy. Anthony d'Offay from London was there and he is decided he loves the Self-Portraits. They acted so unsure before that I did not think they were going to take them so when Keith saw them and wanted to use them on T-shirts for his Pop Shop I said sure and I think they have made up 200 of them so now I guess we have to buy them all back. And Bruno came by and Senator Dodd I do not know why and Peter Beard dropped in and everything just all converged. I gave tours. Then Sylvia Miles said to pick her up at 8:00 for the Liz Taylor tribute at Lincoln Center. Cabbed uptown ($5). And Sylvia was all dressed up and we walked over to Lincoln Center. Liz was an hour and a half late. Finally she came and they showed clips and gave speeches. And I do not know how she gets work she is so late. And her mother was there looking so beautiful. She was the one person Liz thanked. And Liz's one beauty problem now is that when she lost the weight her nose never did get smaller. The liquor's still in it. She has a twenty-inch waist now though.
"Monday, May 6, 1985","[David Geffen, Debbie Harry, Gerard Malanga, Stephen Sprouse, Tama Janowitz]",0.10432098765432098,Ronnie looks so good these days and his art's still really selling. he is going with that Tama Janowitz girl who is such a fast writer she writes so many stories. he is like Gerard Malanga. They both stay emotionally immature. Ronnie has a big cock. He services these girls and he stays young just like Gerard-they do not grow up. And Debbie Harry called and said that it was a big secret but that she just signed with David Geffen. And Stephen Sprouse is so happy about that because he is been turning down people like Madonna who wanted him to do clothes for her because Debbie was the one who really started Stephen and he wanted to be loyal to her that is the kind of person he is. So now she will be out there again.
"Monday, May 7, 1979",[Lee Radziwill],0.124905303030303,Went up to Hoveyda's exhibit at the Bodley Gallery. Hoveyda had a letter in the Times yesterday about his brother a letter to the new regime that said his brother did not run away from the country like all the other ministers because he believed in Iran and Hoveyda called it murder he said that the new prime minister could look forward to getting murdered too. It was a good letter (cab $4.50). Bob had a big lunch where he got lots of Lee Radziwill gossip. Everybody thinks she was just too drunk to make it to her own wedding. In San Francisco. She left the groom waiting at the altar. But I think she is probably just depressed because she got so skinny that her chemical balance changed and she does not know what she wants.
"Monday, May 7, 1984","[Bob Colacello, Jean Michel Basquiat, Jonathan Scull]",0.051388888888888894,Jonathan Scull just called to say that the lunch was cancelled at the Whitney that was going to be for his mother Ethel giving my portrait of her to them because she fell off a ladder and broke her leg in two places. What was she doing on a ladder? And I saw her the other week walking on 66th Street going along talking to herself swinging her hanky. So went to the office and the office was busy. Bruno was there and Jean Michel Basquiat was hiding our work from Bruno-the ones that just Jean Michel Basquiat and I are doing. Bruno has the ones that Jean Michel Basquiat and I and Clemente did but he does not know about these that're just the two of us. Bob Colacello called about the party that Sao's giving for his birthday and Brigid talked to him. I have a feeling Brigid's still very friendly with him. I am invited.
"Monday, May 9, 1983",[Karen Burke],0.03759018759018759,Karen Burke called and I did not want to take the call she was that girl who used to come down with Hoveyda and she likes older men or something. But then she told Brigid she was almost a doctor and that she was a collagen and hair-transplant expert so I took the call and she said she wanted to become my personal doctor for all this stuff. She said she will be getting her license to practice in three months. She came down with about 4000 free samples. She said she worked with Orentreich. she is the one that Rupert got the human heart from when I was doing the Hearts. She took it from a cadaver I guess. Those Hearts of mine were not a hit because I did not figure out how to do them right. I was beginning to use my abstract look. Worked all afternoon. Watched cable TV looking for Andy Warhol's TV on MSG-TV but it was not on so called Vincent and he was in bed already and did not know why it had not been on.
"Monday, November 1, 1982",[],0.07037037037037037,-Peking Two-hour car ride and everybody was singing great American songs. Finally when we got to the Great Wall it actually was really great. I would been putting it down but then it was staggering. We went on the left side because it was not so steep and so crowded and all the Chinese were taking pictures of themselves. My hair almost blew off and I think they got a picture of it. Soldiers go there with their girlfriends. it is like walking up to the Empire State Building. Then we got in a bus and went to the Ming Tombs and that was staggering too and that was somehow two hours away too. It was a whole afternoon. Went to bed with my clothes on. The Peking Hotel. The place was infested with roach motels.
"Monday, November 10, 1980","[Eunice Shriver, Fred Hughes, George Burns, Later Fred, Mick Jagger, Philippe Morillon, Ron Feldman, Shirley Goldfarb, Steve McQueen]",0.14084325396825395,-Paris Philippe Morillon called and said he was bringing over some Interview material at 7:00. Mick was coming over at 4:00 and I wanted to avoid him because I do not know what can you say to Mick Jagger? He wanted to be alone with Fred Hughes anyway-Fred's the one he talks to I do not know what about. Christopher and I walked to Cerutti's and Bambi was playing right next door and since it was a holiday the mothers were standing out there with their kids and it was the longest line of tiny little kids waiting to get into a movie. It seemed so sad that these little kids had to wait they should have opened the doors and let them right in. Went to the Cafe Flore looking for Shirley Goldfarb's ghost (cab $8). And Shirley's ghost was not around. We sat inside and did not see anyone we knew. Went to a bookshop and I finally came across the next idea I really want to work on-mothers with babies sucking on their tits. it is just so erotic I think that it is a good subject. Actually Eunice Shriver gave me the idea and the other night we saw a madonna in an apartment a little baby on top of a sexy lady a cherub sucking on a tit and there is something about that that looks good. So Christopher's going to find me some mothers with babies just born. Then Chris's hotel was right next to the Flore so he took me up to show me his room which we are paying for and I thought it was such a dump but he had gotten a TV and he was really thrilled. In the Herald Tribune they describe the horrible death of Steve McQueen. They really went into detail. Rocksavage invited us over to see his place. There was a big piano and I asked him to play and he just played the most beautiful music. I have not heard good music played on the piano in so long. I did not know-these different periods you go into I never even get to a concert anymore. Later Fred poured me a big glass of Mirabelle and I guess I told him I had personal problems and then we talked about art things to do. Fred thought we should do a series of Disney/Warhol that we should do Snow White and a couple of the dwarfs and Bambi and anything-Donald Duck. And so I was really thrilled after we decided to do that and I hope Ron Feldman will think it is a good idea. I was reading Interview and Bob really wants to drop Tinkerbelle but her interview with George Burns-who I think's had it-she somehow made very interesting. it is a good piece of writing and I think we should keep her. She gets Bob really upset but she is one of our good writers.
"Monday, November 10, 1986","[Chris Makos, Dianne Brill, Howard Read, Joey Arias, John Sex, Martin Burgoyne, Michel Roux, Robert Miller, Sue Simmons, Teresa Scharf]",0.14802789802789804,"Iolas came by he is having a prostate operation and so my Last Supper show is being changed to December 15 which I would hoped would be postponed even more to March. Talked to Michel Roux about doing paintings of the bottles for his new mineral waters. It was the night of the Barneys fashion show benefit for AIDS in the women's shop. Wilfredo was going and at first Sam said he did not want to go but then when he heard Madonna was going to be there he felt he might. We went over (cab $8) and we asked if Madonna was there yet and they said no but she must have come in some disguise because when Iman came down the stairs Madonna swooped in front of her and then all the photographers swooped after Madonna. The show was good great jackets. Good ideas. Everybody was in the show-Joey Arias and John Sex and the girl with the shape Dianne Brill and Teresa Scharf. Madonna had on Martin Burgoyne's denim jacket. And then as we were leaving Chris Makos shoved some nuns at me for a picture and then somebody else started to take the picture and he screamed at the guy ""it is my picture I set it up!"" They were from St. Vincent's the benefit was for them. Howard Read from the Robert Miller Gallery was there and he would just been at the auction where Jasper Johns's painting went for $3.3 million! Which is $3.6 with tax and commission and stuff. So it is the highest price ever paid for a painting of a living artist. And it was not even that great a painting there were better ones. It was not a Target or-it was maybe the Numbers. I had Dollar Bills in this sale and it went for $385000 and a Mona Lisa went for $70000. Wilfredo and Paige dropped me (cab $6). I got home and watched the channel 4 news rerun with Sue Simmons talking about me being at Barneys. God she is a beauty. I met her once at some dinner at the Plaza and she was eating really greasy food a lot of it."
"Monday, November 12, 1979","[Ian Schrager, Steve Rubell]",0.026504629629629628,Halston had invited me to dinner but then Catherine called and said that Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager wanted to take us to Pearl's first. So I went there. Steve told me that Liza's pregnant and she is going to get married but that it was a big secret. We should have let Steve order because he gets cranky. We ordered while he was in the bathroom and then nobody ate anything. Catherine had a slice of pork she is got her thin beautiful body back again. I am down to 132. Then we left and we got into the car to Halston's. Halston had dinner ready. He took me aside and told me that Liza was pregnant but not to tell anyone that it was a big secret. Catherine was trying to make out with Ian. And she was drunk asking Steve again how much he really stole.
"Monday, November 12, 1984","[Eugenia Sheppard, Princess Grace]",-0.016666666666666663,Went to see Stranger Than Paradise. It is not good. Oh and the day had started out with Eugenia Sheppard dying of cancer. She invented fashion and gossip together. I guess she started in 195 5. Is that when Princess Grace got married?
"Monday, November 13, 1978","[Barry Landau, Bo Polk, Nan Kempner, Phyllis Wyeth]",0.09398148148148147,I think I may try brushing the piss on the Piss paintings now. Went over to Jamie and Phyllis Wyeth's at 1 East 66th Street for Phyllis's birthday party that Jamie had called that afternoon to invite me to. Joanne du Pont's name came up. I do not think Jamie likes her much but I do not know why not-I mean he married into the du Ponts too. Nan Kempner arrived. Bo Polk arrived and everyone was thrilled that Barry Landau was not with him. Then Barry arrived. And Bo should really be careful because Barry even takes Polaroids now and it could hurt the people if someday somebody showed pictures of everybody at his bathtub parties. Because at the time it is just all fun but if it got printed in the papers it would look like something else.

And then I went at 3:30 to Julian Schnabel's where I was posing for him. And I had on a Paramount T-shirt which would have been good to pose in but he made me take it off and I was posing like that for two hours standing there. And I took off my glasses so I could look him in the face and still look out of it."
"Monday, November 18, 1985",[Marty Raynes],0.10765873015873015,"Oh and the other day when I was reading in bed Halston dialed my number by mistake and asked for Bianca so when I recognized his voice I said ""Oh yes she is right here in bed with me."" So that was funny. Cornelia called and said I should pick her up for the Marty Raynes dinner at ""21."" Every rich guy was at this dinner and all the right models every ex-model who'd made it. Married a rich guy. Every guy with a million millions chic and in black tie with these beautiful girls. Me I was a mess. They had caviar by the truckload. I ate everything because I was nervous. Dropped Cornelia off. And just as we were arriving at the Olympic Tower where she is living now so was Khashoggi and she had never met him and neither had I. she is a friend of his daughter Nubila's. And he is a big guy. He does not look foreign. Really big. He was nice."

Did some painting. Then cabbed glued ($5.50). Went to Sandro Chia's at 521 West 23rd he is in the same building that Julian Schnabel paints in ($7). Sandro showed me his new paintings.

Then Bob was being interviewed by some newspaper and he told the girl we were having dinner with them at Le Cirque and I got mad and told Bob he should not have so then he changed it to La Grenouille because otherwise they would have sent a photographer to Le Cirque. The story about the marriage made the papers by 5:30. Fred intercepted a call for me from ""Chuck Roast"" because he thought it was a crazy kid but it was actually the Japanese kid who came to interview me once who asked me to give him a name. And downstairs the building directory was smashed right beside my name. It gave me an eerie feeling."
"Monday, November 26, 1984","[Craig Nelson, Linda Li]",0.0,Dr. Linda Li can not find out what is causing my allergies. She said my spleen was traumatized fifteen years ago.

Fred hired a kid to replace Robyn and did not even ask me. And I do not think this kid can be any good because he just sat there for five hours waiting for Fred to arrive instead of seeing what little things he could do like sweep up. he is Italian with an English accent.

He was so nice to me in the sixties I wanted to be nice to him. he is the French art critic. And his wife is very striking 6'2""-I guess she was a model. French women if they are chic have the dykey look. Mrs. Restanay was wearing an old Lanvin men's coat. Ronnie Cutrone came by and while I was working out with Lidija he entertained Pierre and his wife he did not know who they were and Pierre said that he would seen his show at Shafrazi and liked it. Ronnie's selling everything he does. He could have been doing this for years. He actually was doing all that stuff first that the Italians now are doing. And then later I decided to go see Twyla Tharp do dances to Frank Sinatra songs. Called Jon. Picked him up (cab $6). And as we were riding up to the Rainbow Room in the elevator we realized there was a Paramount party on the floor below. Got to the Rainbow Room and it was star-studded. Saw Sam Spiegel and Peter Duchin who said ""This is my live-in girlfriend"" and it was Brooke Hayward. that is a strange couple. And Leo Castelli was there and he does not hug me anymore. he is never with Laura de Coppet anymore either. And this performance I guess Twyla just decided to do something just straight she had nine couples doing nine ballroom dances but any people at Roseland would have done it better. And afterwards I talked to Twyla for a minute. And then as we were leaving I saw Dick Avedon Tuesday Weld ""Taverne"" and Paul Simon and they said Ann Reinking was there and Baryshnikov and Treat Williams (coats $2). So then the elevator stopped on the floor where the Paramount party was and Nick Nolte got on and Eddie Murphy. And Nick Nolte's fat and his hair is over his eyes like one of those dogs but he is so good-looking. They say their movie is really good 48 Hours. And Eddie Murphy's really handsome. That intelligent look. They say he is going to be bigger than Pryor. And I was just speechless and I said how thrilled I was but then I remembered I would met him at something once before. And then some girls were lined up to get Nick Nolte's autograph so I did too and he just kept his head down and signed he did not even look up to see who it was (cab $4). Bed at 12:00."

Kind of busy at the office. Sam was depressed what else is new. He had big circles under his eyes it seemed like he spent the night out. Vincent had been up till 6 A.M. working on a video. The Dia Foundation was having my opening. And there was the sixties party that Jane Holzer was having at the Ritz Fred said we had to go to that. Doc Cox had called in the afternoon and wanted a ticket to the Ritz thing. I was surprised he would not pay because it was a benefit for displaced or disabled kids. So after the Dia Foundation thing we went to Jane's party and Jane did not show the whole time we were there. We were walking out and Stephen Sprouse was there and he is really broke. He may be getting kicked out of his apartment. The deal he was going to sign got complicated. Everything always sounds so great until you start talking to the lawyers.

So after what I went through either I am very strong or (laughs) she is. She said my crystal had been invaded. That it was low on energy and that I had to put it in the sun to recharge it. You put the ""share"" on with your head back. You can not be standing up. You throw your eyes back until you see yellow	she is worried about the same things Bernsohn is-liver kidneys large intestine	And instead of my brother being the invader I think it was that girl in the bookstore. they would said my brother was going to invade the crystal soon and I thought well maybe because I would said things in some interview about my nephew who left the priesthood to marry a Mexican nun and I thought maybe that had made my brother mad. But I think what invaded was the girl. Li and Bernsohn do not overlap. Dr. Li is better. She could have gone into crystals but she went into kinesiology and she massages pressure points and she is a nutritionist. After work I went in my silver jacket and dark glasses to the benefit for Sloan-Kettering and when I got there the P.R. guy who had been the one calling to see if I was coming took me aside and said ""there is no card for you Mr. Warhol."" (laughs) And this is the guy Brigid swore she called to RSVP. I wound up leaving and actually it was great to leave. But if I had not gone in the first place I could have had a nice evening just going to the movies with the kids or something. So that was that. And Edmund Gaultney went to a real doctor yesterday after going to a homeopathic one for a long time. he is sick it is scary. I do not know. You know I would not be surprised if they started putting gays in concentration camps. All the fags will have to get married so they will not have to go away to camps. it will be like for a green card."

Sao was there and Patrick O'Higgins and John Richardson and Boaz Mazor and Amina came in from a fashion show benefit at Studio 54 and she looked beautiful. She said she was writing a play about men who put themselves down in a bar and I told her that everybody does that why not make them fashion models who put themselves down at a fashion show and she said that was a great idea that she would just make the men girls. Ricky Clifton gave me the most beautiful earrings little John Travolta earrings. And this guy who I have met before who did a movie about people who drill holes in their heads was there with his girlfriend and they would both drilled holes in their heads. John was telling me that Boaz when he first met him was the star of Oliver Stone's first feature movie. It was called Michael and Mary. Boaz was Michael. They were shooting it on weekends and John said it was like Cocteau-beauties falling all over the place-and Oliver's mother Jacqueline gave all the kids in the movie poppers to make them act better.

Oh something I forgot to tell the Diary! Somebody told us Jack Haley was a fag! Oh I wish I could remember who it was who told us! I thought Liza had married a real man. He does not seem gay I was shocked. I do not think it is true though. I really do not. Anyway I was upset about Jed being upset so I decided to treat myself to junk food and gave Ronnie money to go out for tea from McDonald's for him and Chris Makos and Bobby Huston ($10). We sat on the couch by the window in the conference room with the pouring rain talking through tea about the movie Bobby Huston is writing that I assigned about kids who commit suicide. Rupert came and helped me work. Barry Landau called. I called Jed and he hung up on me. Then we all left the office and a wonderful thing happened: the rain was so penetrating you were soaked in two feet's walk. It felt so exciting! Later at the Studio 54 party for Diane de Beauvau Diane's name was up in lights. And I went over and screamed at Jay Johnson and Tom Cashin for not telling Jed the things I asked them to to calm him down. So I screamed and did not have a good time. Chris Makos and Bobby Huston were there and Robert Hayes saw Christopher and left said he did not want to run into him. They live together but they fight. Christopher said he had not had sex for three days so he was laughing and trying to rip Bobby Huston's clothes off. I did not have my camera I was not in the mood.

And Paloma was there talking with Clare Boothe Luce and Clare did not recognize me at first but then she said ""you are losing weight and why are you doing that?"" so I went through my modeling lines. She looks very old but it is like a young person dressed in old drag it is a very strange look. The food was good the best dinner I have had there. The queen of Thailand was on the dais. I could only think about her jewels."

But Stuart went out for a minute and missed the call but he might come today. If this is real. Those Bouguereaus are now $2 million apiece and Stuart has about four. They went up so suddenly. it is funny they are just the perfect paintings for Michael Jackson-like ten-year-old boys with fairy wings around beautiful women. And Stuart Pivar is really into young bodies. that is what he thinks keeps you young is the hormones. He wants seventeen-year-olds but he can not get them.

She thought he was a friend doing nice things for her when suddenly she got a bill from him for $2000 for getting her on The Mike Douglas Show! Barry had asked her if she wanted to go on and she said sure. He probably sends Stevie Rubell bills too. Went to Elaine's ($3.25).

And then from there I went to Crazy Eddie's and looked at computers got the Atari game to figure out what all that is about and that was exciting. There was a Columbus Day parade (cab $7). Worked out with Lidija and Chris Makos. I would made a date to see Doc Cox in the evening so I had to get people together to entertain him. Worked on a Piss painting. Then at 9:00 Doc Cox picked me up in his Rolls I do not know why he decided to take it and we Rollsed off to Mr. Chow's."

Walked to 42nd and Sixth Avenue (cab $5.50). The day was really depressing because I had to talk to the accountants about taxes all morning. I ate crackers and coffee. Bob picked me up in a limo and we picked up Sao to go to the Jackie O. party for Diana Vreeland's book Allure at the International Center for Photography at 94th and Fifth. It was a small party only seventy people were allowed. Sao said that a robbery was just foiled at the Carlyle. Three gunmen at 4 A.M. I scared her when I told her they were probably there because they knew she was. And I believe that. Jackie O. arrived. I was afraid to take pictures so I gave one of the newspaper photographers my camera to take a picture with. Chris Hemphill who worked on the book was in heaven he made it so that I had to sit next to him. he is just always rubbed me the wrong way. And on the jacket it said he was (laughs) ""associated with Andy Warhol."" His date was Deborah Turbeville. A trembling kid behind a stairway asked if he could take my picture. He said ""I am an artist."" Jackie was there with the Morgan Library guy Charles Ryskamp. She had Gloria Vanderbilt at her table. And the de la Rentas. Oh I hate them. Francoise does not kiss me anymore. Good. They wanted to go home early. Got home and the music in my house was blasting from top to toe-Aurora was entertaining a gentleman friend and I was so embarrassed that I would come home before she expected. They were playing my new Bee Gees record."

And then Martin called me and it must be so horrible to read this article about yourself where it says you are dying. And then I read Steve Aronson's article in New York magazine on the Sid Bass and Mercedes Kellogg affair and it was riveting he really got all the information. He even had about Mercedes returning Billy Norwich's call because she thought it was from Mick Jagger. It was day-by-day how the romance progressed. I have a funny feeling that Mercedes will never make it all the way to the altar. The divorce'll take two years and you can not spend all that time in bed. Should we all make bets? The alarm went off and I would like to know if they can trigger it off from where they are the alarm company.

And they have a construction owner and a doctor for me and I decided I do not really want to meet anybody it is just fun doing it for them being Gramps and seeing the kids have a good time. And oh I really missed Jean Michel Basquiat so much yesterday. I called him up and either he was being distant or he was high. I told him I missed him a lot. He sees a lot of Jennifer Goode and I guess when they break up he will be available again. And oh for Paige's next blind date I said I have got a 6'3"" black instructor from Lidija's gym for her and she said that was not ""marriage material."" So I do not know. he is straight. Although he came from (laughs) Dmitri Fashions. But he says he is not gay and you have to believe people do not you? When I was walking home I passed all the security people that still guard the Nixon house on 65th Street. I thought he would sold it. And there were policemen nearby and policemen always know me so I would have asked them who lived in this house now that they were still guarding it but then they would write it down that I asked so I did not."

She told me that I was allergic to potatoes and I do not know if she is magic or if she smelled them because I had had some. And she told me not to eat them for a while the white ones. Left there (phone $2 newspapers $3). After work I went with Jean Michel Basquiat to finally check out of his hotel room at the Ritz Carlton but when we got there he decided it was too beautiful to leave.

The gallery was closed but they opened it just for me. I thought it was really great. He did two photos framed in the same frame-things like I used to do-and it looked beautiful. I told Bob we should give Chris two pages a month in Interview to do whatever he wants. Andrew Crispo came in and said that there were very few photos sold from the show but that it looked good. Cabbed to Chembank ($3). The office was busy. Kevin Goodspeed came up for lunch. Yesterday I saw a roach go into the water cooler in between the jar and the stand then I saw it magnified (reimbursed Ronnie for cabs $2.10 $3.05 $2.25). Some African sculptor named Eugene a friend of Joe Eula's was at the office doing a sculpture of me. He says he needs to look at me but I think he just wants a free place to work in. He sees me as a hermaphrodite. he is a terrible sculptor and it does not matter if I pose for him all day or not it is just going to come out like an African totem pole anyway. Then Boris Tinter called and I wanted to escape the office and catch up on the jewelry business so I went up to 47th Street (cab $2.80). Boris had just been to Parke Bernet and had some good new pieces. I love to sit with Boris in his cubicle and see all the strange people who come in. And I love Boris's fake hand.

It just said (laughs): ""Record Price Paid for Flute."" And he is funny he pretends he does not want publicity but then you can see he is so crushed when he does not get it. Like that story Steve Aronson wrote he is so excited about it but he still pretends not to be. John Powers called me from Japan and he is looking for an Elvis to buy. there is one coming up at auction and the reserve is so low. It says ""Three Elvises"" but I do not know if it is a really big one or just where the images overlap three times."

She admitted she would never had caviar in all her years with Elvis because he hated fish and would have thrown her out of the house if he saw her eating any. God what a beauty. I wonder if she had her nose fixed though. It looked a little wider in the early pictures you see of her.

And I laughed in his face when he told me it would be done by Christmas. Oh sure. I will have to think about this. Rupert said that his apartment was robbed so not to get upset if those unsigned prints start showing up at auction. But then the police called and said they would gotten some things back. Worked till 7:30. Cabbed home ($6) and glued then went to dinner at the Sacklers' on Park Avenue and it was for Princess Michael of Kent. And you were supposed to get there before she arrived but I was late. It was dinner for only eight people.

I corner this one bug every night and then I can not bring myself to kill it. he is been eating my food for the past three years. I was reading the Barbara Hutton book and the best thing is she had servants wiping her ass. This is at the end when they are robbing her blind. And in the end she was so poor from all these people taking her money that she had to go and ask the people she would given gifts to if she could have them back-oh but wait. It could have just been the people working for her who decided to do it. I did not think of that ... I just keep worrying that I have made a mistake buying the 33rd Street building. Maybe we just should have bought it and turned it over right away. But it is the real estate key to that whole block because of the T shape. there is a truck coming on Friday to move some things out of 860.

I had to meet Marjorie Copley who was having her picture taken for a portrait. Rupert was the makeup person. she is light her hair was in pigtails and she took them out and it went down to her ass she would just washed it and it smelled good. We had lunch. she is going to school. She was a science major but she was not smart enough and now she wants to do social sciences and I told her oh no. Bill looks great. The only thing we are still worried about is that she did fire all the people who worked for him. She did not seem pushy or tough like I expected though. She just did whatever I asked her to. She was nice. Jed bought the apartment right across the hall from Stuart Pivar's in the building on West 67th Street next to the Cafe des Artistes. he is going to use it as an office for his decorating business so his clients and all the workmen will not be tramping in and out of the house all day anymore so that'll be a relief. I called Jane Holzer. I said I would pick her up for the Diane Von Furstenberg party for Diana Vreeland. Worked till 8:00 then cabbed ($5.50) to pick Jane up at the Volney on 74th and Madison where she is got the penthouse with Rusty now. Jane's apartment is small but nice. Rusty answered the door and he is put on weight because I guess he spent the summer with his father Lenny but he is so charming. it is like listening to Cary Grant. He says ""Love to you Mommy."" Jane's now in investing and real estate and movies. So then cabbed to DVF's ($3). As soon as we got to the building Warren Beatty walked in behind us but when he saw us he went outside again he did not want to go into the same elevator. I told Jane he would come in and then gone out again and she said that if he would seen her he would not have done that. Right after we got upstairs Warren came in and he kissed Jane and I told him ""Oh Warren you are so mean you would not ride up with us"" and he said he was looking for someone he was supposed to meet downstairs. But he did not come in with anyone so ... He looked sexy but a little older and a little puffier-his hair's that Hollywood way you know that looks like a hat? Richard Gere was there and I introduced him to Jane and he said ""Oh Baby Jane you are a legend. I read about you in Popism."" Apollonia was there and 'man and a beautiful young girl named Diane Lane-I do not know if she was with Lou Adler or not."

But I just can not see it. she is fifty-five trying to look thirteen. Like me. it is just paying someone to care about you. Got a cab (cab $5.50 newspapers $2 phone $2). Went to the office. I was nervous about going down to the book signing at B. Dalton's on 8th Street and Sixth Avenue after what happened to Keith on Saturday. And I am having a very hard time sending that $10000 back to Sandy Gallin. I keep losing the address. Cabbed to B. Dalton's ($5). It was not a big shoving crowd it was orderly the whole time a long spaghetti line that lasted for two and a half hours and we sold 150 books and Craig Nelson from Harper & Row was acting like a star. Chris Makos came by and he was impressed with my popularity. And Christopher was looking at the America book and saying ""Oh God half these pictures were taken in Europe!"" (laughs) And he was so right! And it was so nice to hear him putting down Craig. I enjoyed it. And the book costs $16.95 and there was a 10 percent discount and one girl bought six copies and I had to sign long things for her like ""Dear Harry I hope you have a good season in the Adirondacks...."" I have been forgetting to say that the new ""Disco"" installation at Area has me and Diana Vreeland waiting to get into Studio 54. it is funny."

One man from France died-the first one to die in the marathon. And the girl who won was pooping in her pants she had diarrhea and they tried to brush over it but they said ""she is tugging at her pants again."" Kenny Scharf called and invited me out for a ride in his Cadillac that he drove here from LA and painted. Now he is got champagne glasses and monsters on it. He and Keith came along and the car looked like really something and the police were in back of them because they were just curious like everybody else. So we drove uptown to 90th Street and East River Drive to see the mural that Keith had done. it is like 2.5' wide X 200' long like three blocks long. He painted it white and sprayed little black and red figures but it would have been better just silver. It does not make the city look better really. Halston called and invited me to dinner at his house where Jack and Anjelica and Steve Rubell and Alana were going to be and Bianca and I said sure and watched TV and then at 9:00 walked over there. Ann Turkel who was married to Richard Harris was there. Bianca was kissing her boyfriend as if she were Jade or something in front of Alana who was talking about money settlements. These girls. it is so strange like over the hill talking about ""settlements."" Bianca was putting down Alana's house in L.A. and saying it was so trashy and in the worst taste and she and Alana almost had a fistfight. they are friends. And the big person at the party was Peter Wolf and I told him how all the girls were so crazy about him they love him in his music video. Dinner was good. Halston's hair is receding a little. His house does not have the flair that it had when Victor lived there."

But I forgot to. Catherine and I went over to Gleason's Gym to interview the girl boxer Jackie Tonawanda (cab $2.60). Lots of good-looking fighters went by. I asked about how you can own a fighter and Jackie said it would cost mostly to pay her because she would manage them and that would be $150 a week and then some more to rent a locker at Gleason's. Catherine fell in love with a 6' 5"" black fighter who was jumping rope. I tried to get her interested in a cute Irish kid but she said he was too ordinary-looking. Jackie was not too good an interview because I would mentioned something about a movie and that was all she would keep bringing up. she is ready to go to Japan and fight a 6'3"" Japanese-Irish girl. Then we cabbed up to the William Morris Agency ($3). We went up to the thirty-third floor. A guy there Steve Pincus had been calling the office a lot wanting me to come over and talk to them about representing me. The meeting was fun he had other guys in there and they were telling me they would get me American Express TV commercials and Broadway shows and starring roles in movies and Catherine got so impressed and God it was so boring you would think I had not heard all this for years going up to William Morris and then after the Big Meeting nothing happens. But I enjoyed going there. They were all married but they looked like closet queens. Catherine told me not to call her a ""rich bitch"" because it was undignified. So now I finally know what to call her. At dinner at Peter Luger's Steakhouse I told Diane de Beauvau who was with her boyfriend Pierre that when I was leaving the house it was on the radio or the TV that a five-year-old Patino girl had been kidnapped. Diane burst out crying hysterically and everybody turned on me and said I would spoiled the party. Stevie went to the phone and called the wire services to get the story and it was only a distant relative. But Diane was still hysterical and they were saying ""To cry is a good thing it brings out feeling"" and in the middle of all this the cute Irish waiter came over and told me that he had an Art Deco radio in his room-that he knew I collected them. Timothy Leary told about how in the early seventies Diane had chased him around Switzerland and sent him notes and letters and he said that it was actually Diane carrying on like that that got him locked up. He told me I was one of his most favorite people of always. Bob Weiner was there still researching his article on Steve and I am sure it is going to be so bad because 1) it is him writing it and 2) he did not pay any attention at dinner while all these great things were happening and with all these great people together-he said it was ""boring."" And every time Stevie would pick up a boy Bob would turn the other way. And then Stevie started rushing everybody-that is all he likes to do is rush to get someplace and then rush to leave. But Tim told him that for years-in prison-he would been rushed and told what to do and he was not going to rush anymore. Then we went to Elaine's. Stevie was too zonked to drive so Diane's boyfriend Pierre drove. First we had to stop at Stevie's house and he went in to get more Quaaludes or poppers or something I think. Margaux Hemingway was with us. Her marriage to the Wetson hamburger guy is splitting up and Tim was after her I guess. Then Stevie wanted to go to the Barefoot Boy and the Gilded Grape."

There was a Halloween party at Studio 54 Stevie kept giving me more drinks and then somebody shoved a Quaalude in my mouth and I was going to shove it to the side but it got stuck and then I drank vodka and it went down and that was a big mistake. My diamond choker was pinching my neck-I hate jewelry. How do ladies wear it? it is so uncomfortable. I went home by cab and got in around 6:30 somehow. My boyfriend Peter came up and found me with my boyfriend Danny so I introduced them as my boyfriends and that got them interested in each other so they went off together."

He was just one of those kids who drove me crazy. he is black but some people say he is Puerto Rican so I do not know. And then Bruno discovered him and now he is on Easy Street. he is got a great loft on Christie Street. He was a middle-class Brooklyn kid-I mean he went to college and things-and he was trying to be like that painting in the Greenwich Village. And so had lunch for them and then I took a Polaroid and he went home and within two hours a painting was back still wet of him and me together.

A guy there told me ""We have someone in common."" He said that his family owned all the brandy and sherry in Spain and that in the sixties Nico was the girl in all their advertisements in all the posters and subways and magazines that she was famous all over Spain. He wanted to know where this beautiful girl was now and I said that it was a whole other person that he would never believe it that she was fat and a heroin addict. He wanted to see her and I said that if she was still playing at the Squat Theater we could go see her. C.Z. took the station wagon and drove us to the Met to the Cardin fashion show dinner. It was the longest fashion show in the world. I was so surprised I think he is kept every dress he ever made there were so many of them. I liked the show but the ladies were bored. I saw Bill Paley and Barbara Allen and Slim Keith. I wish I would taken pictures it was all the right people together. I thought the diamonds in the eyes of Sao's foxes were real but she said they were not. She asked where she could get an inexpensive ruby bracelet and I told her I would seen one for $42000. She said it was for a man and I guessed Patrice Calmette because that is who she is been seeing she is broken up with Naguib she said he made her too emotional. Bob Denison was there with his new girlfriend China Machado and I am going to do a million faux pas with her because I just know I will never recognize her. Catherine Oxenberg's mother Princess Elisabeth of Yugoslavia was there. she is beautiful and I knew it was her from the moment she opened her mouth they talk just alike the voice. She was wearing one of Carolina Herrera's dresses. And I talked to Paloma's mother Francoise Gilot. I talked orchids with C.Z. Her gardening column is syndicated in six newspapers now. I had a lot of fun. We were taking Sao home to the Carlyle we were outside getting a cab when Andre Oliver insisted we take his limo. I saw Pierre Cardin at the end and told him his show was great-I did like it because he would kept so many dresses from 1950-1980. Oh and the dinner was in the Temple of Dendur room and they gave everyone Temple of Dendur books and chocolate truffles and I squashed some truffles between the pages of a couple of the books and it looked like shit and Sao loved it. And a guy lost his book so I gave him mine and when he opens it it is going to look like shit. Sao had me autograph hers.

So Jean Michel Basquiat's finding out how you have to be a business how it all stops being just fun and then you wonder What is art? Does it really come out of you or is it a product? it is complicated. Oh I forgot to say that Dr. Rossi's kid who is just out of Yale wants to do videos and so I am sending him to talk to Vincent.

When we got there I said to Mrs. de Menil that gee she was a great-grandmother-Tiya just had a baby-and I guess I should not have said that because she can not face it but what I meant was that she looks so beautiful much better than her kids. I talked to Peter Schjeldahl the art critic who I know hates me but I was working hard for him to like me so we talked about Ted Berrigan dying from diet pills and Coke-the soda.

Eunice Shriver had called in the morning and said she wanted to come in to see the Modern Madonnas that I told her about and I invited her for lunch but then later she cancelled. The place was busy everyone was running around. One of those boys from Las Vegas that Edmund Gaultney brought by decided to have his portrait done. We could not find anyone to do makeup though so I did the makeup myself and I guess I can actually do makeup it came out pretty good. The boy was really suntanned I put on white. Went downtown to Dr. Giller's birthday party. It was the pretty people everyone we knew. Rupert crashed and when Rupert crashes he stands there in bright red and smiles. Tommy Pashun was there. And a defense lawyer named Ed Hayes who looked like he was from Laverne and Shirley like a plant that people invite to parties to wear funny clothes and jump around and make things ""kooky."" Sort of forties clothes really crewcut about twenty-nine. He said ""I can get ya outta anything."""

But they probably will not like it they will probably say they wanted a canvas. Gerry Grinberg from North American Watches does not like my design idea of hanging lots of the same watch faces off of one bracelet. You know ""multiples"" like my paintings. He says men would not buy that. They just want one watch face on a band. My tuxedo has moth holes in it. Now they are in that closet too but I do not want to take the clothes out of there and risk maybe spreading the larvae around. I will have to do a big vacuuming. Went to a screening at the Coronet of the new Blake Edwards movie. Behind us was Tony Bennett with his art teacher. Tony said he is doing a portrait of Frank Sinatra."

And the new issue of Interview came out with the Schwarzenegger cover which I love it has the comic-book look. And the whole issue I like. It looks the way Vanity Fair should look. Just the right amount of odd things. Laura Ashley died after falling down her daughter's stone steps. But she never advertised. I was just thinking about these English people who just take take take and never do anything for you. We never got a thing from Fred's best friend Lord Jermyn. But you know those Mick Jagger prints that the Heskeths were going to dump on the market? It worked out well-we bought them back and now they are the most popular after the Marilyns so that was a good thing. Paige had people for lunch and I was looking at their jewelry and thinking it was costume and they were telling me how much it was and I was saying (laughs) ""Gee that is like what the real stuff costs."" And actually it was real. And Gael took the Jewish holiday off although she is told me she is Catholic and then once she said Episcopalian."

There was a lunch for Jack Kroll from Newsweek and I had invited two friends of his too one who made a movie that Jack liked called Anti-Clock and I did not know if the girl was his girlfriend or if she did P.R. it is a small movie an art movie. They told me ""it is your kind of movie"" (laughs) so you can imagine what it is like. Bob told me the reason he is after Newsweek is so they will do a cover story on me but I do not want one. I mean what are they going to say? Reporters will just rehash. ""He lives on the Upper East Side with two dachshunds and he is a sometimes walking-stick for Paulette Goddard."" Well maybe they will feel the same way I do too that it is too boring. I mean you have to do something different like get married and have a couple of kids or take a few drugs or lose a few hundred pounds or die to be good copy. Dropped Rupert and Bob ($4) and went home and got into black tie. Robyn's mother Mrs. Amory invited me to the Cancer dance. I invited Gael Malkenson. I went over to Gael's and she was in a bright green dress. We had a drink there. Her boyfriend is out of town. He works at a cheese company and she is gotten fat because he brings home all this cheese. Cabbed to Lincoln Center ($2.50). They had an orchestra and all the old bags were out on the floor doing the foxtrot and there is always that one seventy-five or eighty-year-old lady who gets out there and is the first to start really jumping. These old bags still want men to go to bed with them. They look like the ladies at Bonnie & Clyde that dyke bar downtown where every table it is women who look like anybody's mother. The Gilmans were there they are now best friends with Robyn's mother they have a house next to her in Tuxedo Park. And I asked Sondra whatever happened to Adela Holzer and she said ""My dear you will not believe it she is been staying with me at my house for eight months and she is going to come out of court victorious."" that is a good friend I guess. But then if she is such a good friend why did she let her sit in jail for four days? The raffle was a trip to Milan. Why would someone want to go to Milan? Gael and I spent the night talking about the magazine and Robyn and I tried to get her to dish Bob but she said she would not talk about her boss she just said she goes to the other side of the room when he screams."

When they saw them they said they would thought I was going to do something new but I would done them my usual way because that is what I thought they wanted. they are going to pay a user's fee. But I do not know about these low prices I get when I do stuff for magazines because I think of the time Carl Fischer took my picture for the New York cover for the Philosophy book-I mean he had a whole set built and then he had eight assistants or something so look how much they probably spent on that. So I got all worked up thinking about how cheaply I work and it made me call Vogue and ask them where the money they owe me was. Keith told me that he rented a store for $1500 across from the Puck Building. So I guess he is a little like Peter Max. But then Peter Max never did get in the good art collections that Keith's in. And he said he will not sell his stuff to any other store it will just be in his own store. And Nick Rhodes buys art but he does not listen to anybody and I told him that it is stupid not to that it is just like buying stocks. But he said ""I just buy what I like."" And I remember Kaye Ballard saying the same thing when she bought pictures twenty or thirty years ago and then could not even get back what she paid for them. And Bruno had called earlier. These combined paintings of Jean Michel Basquiat and me and Clemente that he said were ""just a curiosity that nobody would want to buy"" that he paid $20000 for like fifteen pictures for he is now selling for $40000 or $60000 apiece! Yes! And I have a funny feeling that he is actually giving Clemente more because I can not see him doing this for this little. And I should get more because I bring up the prices ... oh but well Jean Michel Basquiat got me into painting differently so that is a good thing."

Richard Weisman was coming to the office at 2:30. When he arrived he said I had to go to Columbus tomorrow to take pictures of Jack Nicklaus. Richard and Fred had a meeting about the series of sports-star portraits Richard commissioned and I wished I would stayed in the meeting longer because after I left they decided there would be the show in December of the ten Athletes portraits we finally settle on to exhibit and I think January would be much better. Chris Makos came by and gave me a copy of White Trash his book of photos and it looked good he did a good job. Left the office early. Doc Cox said he was picking me up in his Rolls Royce and I cringed because I just hate to be seen in that car. But he arrived in a cab and I was secretly thrilled when he told me the Rolls had broken down. But I changed my mind when we arrived at the Folk Art Museum because there were photographers all over and actually for once the car would have been a big hit because just getting out of a crummy taxi was a bomb. Ultra Violet was there and now thinking about it she must have had a facelift. She looked like the first day I met her really great. Really really great. She was wearing a dress with gold coins pinned to it and she was selling them. She already sold the good American ones. I think she got the idea of owning gold coins from me in the days when she thought that whatever I did must be really smart. We went over to the Four Seasons. There were cocktails in the lobby before dinner. I was seated in between Sandra Weidenfeld and Estee Lauder. Estee was really nice she would put perfume on the table for free samples. Peter Duchin's orchestra was playing. Marina Schiano did not like the end of the table she was at-she was upset she was not with Fred Diana Vreeland and Diane de Beauvau-and she said that for $100 she should be able to sit next to her husband Mr. Hughes. [Marina was married to Fred Hughes for a few years although they maintained separate residences.] She went over to Bob who was at another table having a miserable time and told him that she was going home-this is 10:15-and to pick her up for the Studio 54 party in about an hour. She said that she could have been out with Marvin Gaye instead of at this thing. Doc Cox was really drunk drooling over Bob's Kevin. Kevin Farley. I signed things for people and felt bad because they were my friends and I went blank and could not remember their names-people I would known for twenty years who gave me my first job. And then afterwards Alana Hamilton was giving a birthday party for Mick Flick at Studio 54. I was so happy to go to a big fun party after that horrible dinner (cab $2.50). Peter Beard was at Studio 54 and for the first time I saw him so drunk that his words were slurring. He told me he was glad after the Montauk fire burned his mill-house down that he would not be doing diaries anymore that he was actually relieved they would all been destroyed. I told him not to be relieved that he had to do more. Sterling St. Jacques was there he said he has a part in The Wiz-he and Pat Cleveland have broken up. He brought me over to Shirley Bassey and she seemed thrilled to meet me. Stevie Rubell was nice to me and kept bringing me vodkas but the vodka there is the cheapest and I hide it. But when Bob came over it was just what he drinks so I gave it to him but Kevin shook his finger and said that it was a ""no-no""-he does not want Bob to drink. it is so sick Bob letting himself be henpecked."

Then went up to her and she said ""I do not think I want to talk to you I have taken you out of my prayers you said I was better when I had not found God so now I pray for you- badly."" So I think it was something I said in the Faye Dunaway interview in Interview I guess she read it. And I did not know what to do I was a nervous wreck I said ""Oh no Lana you have got to pray for me please put me back in your prayers!"" And I said ""Oh will not you please autograph your book to me?"" And so she finally did and wrote ""To a Friend"" with a question mark and then ""God Bless You"" with another question mark. And Lana and her fairy hairdresser and I were all there with the same hair."

Stood in the back next to Bobby De Niro but I did not recognize him with a ponytail. Doug Cramer who gave me the job on Love Boat was there and he said that when I go to L.A. on December third that Shirlee Fonda would give a party for me and I do not know anything about this trip and I have a feeling it conflicts with something. I guess the whole place there was filled with movie stars but they look so different in the morning. Martin Scorsese made a speech and they showed clips from The Pirate with Judy and Some Came Running and it was just great. Read in the papers about the woman who fell nineteen floors down an elevator shaft and it turns out she would come to one of Paige's advertising lunches at the office. She worked for Chanel. She was in the elevator with her husband and another couple and it got stuck and there was nobody around so she crawled up and she fell. Can you imagine how horrible it was being in the car and knowing she was falling? And Sam's still mad at me so to teach him a lesson and make him feel he was missing out on so much glamour by being mad when I got to the office I had Wilfredo write in my date book for every night this week: ""John Travolta ... Diana Ross ... Warren Beatty"" but he did it all in the same handwriting he was not clever enough to vary it so I guess Sam will realize it is a fake. Because see Sam always checks my book and when he sees I am doing something glamorous that night he plays it goody-goody all day so I will invite him. My nephew Don and his friend David were around working on the computer things at Interview. I do not know if they really know what they are doing or not. And then Donald says he is not sure he wants to go into business with David that he is kind of hard to be with-I am letting them stay in that apartment I own downtown on Hanover Square the one Richard Weisman said was a good investment to buy when it went co-op."

Jay's going-I guess he and Kate are back together. I asked Paige if she wanted to go with me to Ahmet Ertegun's party at the Carlyle (cab $3). Ahmet was at the door. Same usual people-Jerry Zipkin Mica and Chessy. The lights were so low. Mrs. Buckley was there and Charlotte Curtis and Charlotte screamed at me ""Oh your eyebrows are dyed!"" So what could I say? ""Yeah. they are two-tone."" Charlotte always looks so sour. But I do like her. She did those great columns in the sixties. Paige was the youngest one there."

For the January cover. I mean would not that just put Interview on the map? I would even vote Republican. I know I do not vote but I am thinking of registering again because they just started getting the jury-duty lists from the tax rolls instead of the voter things and so I got one.

Had an hour of exercises. I am so tired from them that I really do sleep at night and I get hungry from them so I eat more too. The office was really busy. Lucio Amelio was there.

There was no line so we thought it would be empty inside for Blue Velvet but we got in and it was packed. And what a good movie so weird and creepy. A lot of couples walked out. And Dennis Hopper was finally good. Now he should do straight roles. he is handsome he could get the old Rock Hudson roles. Isabella Rossellini could have been so beautiful without that awful wig. I can not believe she could do a movie like that without breaching her Lancome contract. Went home looking out for weirdos. Watched a Betty Grable movie on TV and the color was so great she was such a beauty and they just can not color like that now. Great color and great makeup.

Pia Zadora called and said she was coming down. And they all came-her husband Riklis his mother and some other guy. I would done twelve portraits of her. And they just liked two and they were not the ones that I thought were the best. So we have all these portraits left over. But we were lucky she bought the Dollar Sign. Worked alone till 6:00.

Somebody checked into a hotel and they did not look under the bed and the next day they did and there was an eighty-one-year-old woman strangled to death. So you can imagine what that place is like. Well it is so hot there I think in hot places people get nuts. It fries your brain. Finally we went up and I went to the bathroom in the airport I was really scared to go there alone thinking of all these murders there and there were a couple of people in back of me and I thought it was going to be a mugging but as I turned around-I had not even washed my hand-the guy just wanted my autograph and to shake my hand. He was one of the workers there. White. On the plane the girl in the seat in front of me wanted an autograph so I signed a sick bag for her.

Sharon said she could not drink after 12:00 because she was getting her eyes lifted in the morning by Dr. Rees and we kept telling her that she was stupid that she did not need it but she said she wanted to get the fat out and it was a good time to begin. And then she is going to get silicone in her cheeks to fill up the line marks around her mouth so she is starting early. Dustin Hoffman was there with his girlfriend and he walked by and did not say anything to me. David Merrick was the big hero there everybody came up to shake his hand. And I kept telling Sharon that I was finished that nobody would say hello to me. But then the Secret Service all came in and what is-his-name came over to say hello to me. Jack Carter. So it was a really good night there.

And one day I remember she had a lady over who had no teeth and the lady was eating a bowl of soup and she did not finish it and my aunt gave it to me and made me finish it I guess because she had no money and did not want to waste food ...

"Saturday, April 19, 1980","[Aileen Mehle, Barry Landau, Bob Wilson, Diana Vreeland, Jerry Zipkin, Katy Jones, Lynn Wyatt, Miz Lillian]",0.11229540778151888,Fred called and said I had to pick up Lynn Wyatt that the limo would be at my house at 8:00. The Saturday newspapers were great. There was the bathtub murders the guy says he kills things and does not remember-things like his wife and daughter-and that it used to happen to him with animals too that he would wake up and look around and they would be dead. And the full Barry Landau story how he is Miz Lillian's best friend and he is going down to Washington to testify again. Left the office at twenty to 8:00 and when I got uptown the limo was already waiting there (cab $5.50). So I went in and glued and Lynn Wyatt called and said that Jerry Zipkin was having cocktails first at 95th and Park and I told her it was Harlem. But we went up there. Then we went to the St. Regis where Francois de Menil was having his thirty-fifth birthday party bash and we went up to the roof. Francois had his new girlfriend from Texas there. And some of his old girlfriends too. Lynn wanted to be at the table with Diana Vreeland and Fred. And Francois's older brother George who keeps a low profile. Bob Wilson was there he is dating the Schlumberger girl from Washington Katy Jones. Little Nell was there the English dancer. Aileen Mehle was there. It was an okay party. There was no big movie star or rock star there it was just in a funny way all his friends. Lynn could not come down to 860 to see her portrait she was going to Paris the next day.
"Saturday, April 20, 1985","[Catherine Guinness, Diana Vreeland, Jean Michel Basquiat, Keith Haring, Marilyn Monroe]",0.21333333333333332,"I got a call from Keith he wanted to work all day on painting the elephant. Fred had it painted white so Keith could do a painting on it. This is the elephant I had to buy for Diana Vreeland's costume show at the Met for ""Marilyn Monroe"" to be riding on. It was pink and then after the show it came to Fred at the Factory and then Jean Michel Basquiat and Victor painted some stuff on it but not much but still I would have kept it a Jean Michel Basquiat even though it was not much of one but Fred thought it would be better as a Keith Haring and so Keith is going to paint it now that it is white. Cabbed up for dinner with Cornelia at Mortimer's ($4). She was not there but Cosima von Bulow was there with her father Claus. he is handsome. He said ""Thank you for being nice to me before I was a star."" I do not know if he was being funny. I guess he means when he used to come to lunch at the office when Catherine Guinness was working there. And then he left and said that he knew Cosima was in good hands. And she is so beautiful. I had a good talk with her. She said she did not want to be an actress because her teacher at one of those schools like Brearley discouraged her after she was in a play-said she was no good or something. Everybody just comes over to her and asks her about her father. Absolutely everybody. People who do not even know her. But she is a good actress she handles it well."
"Saturday, April 22, 1978","[Jerry Hall, Tom Cashin]",0.23528083868992963,"Went up to the Carlyle where Jerry Hall is registered as ""Miss Philips."" On the way we got film (cab and film $5). Jerry was ready to go as soon as we got there she came down in a second. Cabbed to Quo Vadis ($2). she is so beautiful everybody looks at her. she is only twenty I did not know she was so young. We avoided talking about Mick. She said she left Texas and went to Paris when she was sixteen. Her first roommate was Tom Cashin and then she met Antonio and he drew her and everything. Oh but Mick and she are going to have beautiful children and I guess Mick really does want children-he had Jade and Jade's pretty but the kids he will have with Jerry will be stunning. Maybe a beautiful boy. I think he wants someone who will stay home now that he is not going to be on the road too much. He wants a wife who will be there and Jerry's willing to give up her career. Then after we left Quo Vadis we walked along Madison back to the Carlyle and had champagne and orange juice. While they stay there Mick pays the hotel and Jerry pays room service. She makes good money $750 or $1000 a day. She showed us a love letter from Mick it said ""I love you""-it was signed ""M"" with an ""X."" We did not have any more tapes so I said ""Why do not we tape over one of Mick's?"" You know meaning one of his new originals. I was kidding but would not that have been funny? Jerry wants to be an actress. she is taking lessons."
"Saturday, April 26, 1980","[Charles Aznavour, Diana Vreeland, John Bowes-Lyons, Mark Gero, Michael Caine, Ossie Clark, Robert Hayes]",0.0409702380952381,"Robert Hayes has been missing a lot of work and Bob found out it is because he is taking a lot of coke which is not like him at all but the photographers and the stylists just hand it out so freely to editors especially because they want the work and so he is been calling in a lot and saying he has ""a cold"" and doing things that he usually does not do. I had to go to Lincoln Center to see Clytemnestra. The dance came out good really great and Martha was thrilled because she would been worried about it. Nureyev danced he was awful. Saw him in the dressing room and said hello. Bianca was wearing a Halston dress with an Ossie Clark coat. And the dress was beautiful it was flesh-colored in a V on top so it looked low-cut. And the best thing was Diana Vreeland eating a banana. This banana was lying around Martha's dressing room and Diana really wanted it so she peeled it and just ate it right from the peel and it looked so funny. she is old enough to look really really funny. She loves bananas. Afterwards we went over to Halston's and had a little supper. We tried to pick up some of the dancers and bring them with us but Halston said Martha would not like it. So it was just Martha and Bianca and me and Diana and John Bowes-Lyons. And Liza and Mark Gero came over. And an English guy who said he wrote songs for Charles Aznavour. And he had a girl with him-Filipino I think-and this girl said she would lived with Michael Caine and since Bianca had lived with him too the girl poured her heart out to Bianca and Bianca dished too she said she would never talked about him before. They agreed that if he got drunk he would scream for hours. And this girl said she would just do everything for him get up at 5:00 and make him breakfast and then she would go to the set and then leave half an hour before he did to go home and make him dinner. They both said that sex with him was ""memorable"" but I do not know if they meant really good or really bad."
"Saturday, April 26, 1986","[Barbara Walters, Christopher Kennedy, Clint Eastwood, Eddie Schlossberg, Joe Kennedy, Kurt Waldheim, Marc Bohan, Nancy Collins, Norma Kamali, Oprah Winfrey, Peter Duchin, Phyllis Wyeth, Ted Kennedy]",0.061167293513183923,"-New York-Hyannis Massachusetts-New York I got up at 6:00 called Peter at 7:00. The doorbell rang half an hour early and it was Peter with no Grace. He said he went to pick her up and woke her up and she said to come back in an hour. The weather was just a little off. Slightly cloudy. We went to pick up Grace in the Village and she came out in Norma Kamali black wool underwear. Also a fur Kenzo hat. She put her makeup on in the car and in the plane. We arrived an hour late to the airport. The flight was so easy through this grey fog all the way and nothing happened whereas on a clear day sometimes you hit an air pocket and go diving. Grace put on a green Azzedine in the ladies' room of the airport. Peter rented a car a yellow station wagon and he knew where the church was and drove us there. Then he went to check on his house in East Falmouth. The crowd outside the church screamed ""Grace!"" and ""Andy!"" There was the biggest mob I have ever seen around a church. We went in and they had folding chairs near the door. Oprah Winfrey gave a speech. Jamie and Phyllis Wyeth were in front of us and they turned around and said that we would caused too much commotion outside they were funny. And at the car rental we would seen all these glamorous names like ""Clint Eastwood"" and ""Barbara Walters"" and the St. James girl but they were not there. And watching this storybook wedding you just wonder about what it will be like when the divorce comes. Jackie got communion so she walked all the way around the church with John-John to show herself off she looked beautiful. The church service was an hour and the wedding ceremony was fifteen minutes. They had a girl singing ""Ave Maria."" Peter was waiting outside and later he told us that when Arnold and Maria went out they were nice for the photographers they rolled down the window and smiled and posed. But Jackie never smiled at anyone she was a sourpuss. And I guess they would had parties for three days or something because everyone told me that at a thing the night before Arnold gave my portrait of Maria to the Shrivers and said ""I am gaining a wife and you are gaining a painting."" And everyone was telling me how great it was they really loved it. And then a friend of Arnold's brought in a sculpture that Kurt Waldheim sent them and it was really ugly. And Arnold's always giving all these speeches and he said ""My friends do not want me to mention Kurt's name because of all the recent Nazi stuff and the you.N. controversy but I love him and Maria does too and so thank you Kurt."" Outside the church there was a limo and a guy shoves us in and we could not see Peter. Then we got to the compound and Peter had seen us get in the limo and followed us so he was right there. He handed me the drawings I did of Maria but then I did not know what to do with them. But Eddie Schlossberg saw me and he said he would put them in the house and I thanked him. It was freezing. Ran into an Austrian and he took us to a tent where oyster openers were getting oysters ready and Grace wanted some right then and there but they said they were being served to people in the other tent but then someone came over with a plate of them just for her and she ate thirty oysters and then twenty more just slurping them down. And Christopher Kennedy was around he is so cute. Jackie was sitting with Bettina. And Marc Bohan. I did not look at Jackie I felt too funny. Then there was dancing and music. Peter Duchin and his wife. He was (laughs) going off to do another party. He works so hard. Grace began dancing and it was like in a movie everybody stopped to watch. She was dancing with a little boy. We were at Joe Kennedy's table with his wife. Talked to Nancy Collins. I asked her if she was covering it and she said ""Oh no no no. This is a personal thing."" She was best friends with Maria I do not know when. We talked about the Stallone piece she did for Rolling Stone which was not much and she was annoyed with Stallone she said he put her off six times and then did not give her much time. But he only gave PH an hour and Interview's was really great unusual. I was trying to take pictures but I could not get in there and really shove. Arnold's body-building friends had cameras and so the Kennedys could not really stop them but they had their own photographer and they would say ""Oh Chuck would you come and take this picture?"" And so then the pictures all belonged to the Kennedys. Like at Madonna's wedding they should have let guests take pictures because people at a wedding they would just be doing it for themselves anyway. Maybe years later you would use them but you would not rush them to the New York Post in the morning. The food was so good raw vegetables that they steamed while you watched. Grace and Ted Kennedy danced. Then Grace and Arnold were having a talk about what she should do about Dolph because he is fucking all her girlfriends. I told her she should marry Dolph just for a minute because it would be such a great wedding. But I always give Grace the wrong advice. I am the one who told her she would never make it unless she toned down her look that people would never go for anything so extreme. The cake was six or ten feet high. Everybody was coming up and telling me how they loved the painting. Shriver gave a speech he was in tails. And he was talking about ""losing a daughter."" Well I mean she is twenty-nine-he is lucky to lose her. And Arnold gave a speech and was saying wonderful love things like that he would make her happy. It was the first time I have seen really announceable love saying everything all out loud. Then it was time to leave and two Kennedy boys had Grace by the door and one was rubbing his cock against her and then we went to the airport."

Because I mean row with Lou not wanting to get back for a reunion with the others I just am thinking that I really should figure out a way to get money out of that first album. I mean I produced it!And now Vincent just found the master tapes! We have the masters! And I am not going to worry whether we have the right to use the masters or to make a video out of our old film clips of them. Just let them try to sue me. You know? Keith came to the office to paint on the big elephant and he did a beautiful job on it. it is black and white with a red base. I think I would have liked it better just black and white but it is great. Keith's great. He really is a cartoonist. And they say he is like Peter Max but he is really not. He has something else. Peter Max was just a businessman trying to be an artist. He copied me a lot. And now he gets $100000 for a portrait. Look. Here's how it all works: You meet rich people and you hang around with them and one night they have had a few drinks and they say ""I will buy it!"" Then they tell their friends ""You must have his work darling"" and that is all you need. I mean it is like Schnabel sitting there with Philip Niarchos. that is all it takes. So you get your price established. Get it?"
"Saturday, April 3, 1982","[Bob Rauschenberg, Eddie Murphy, Lady McCrady]",0.04911976911976912,I went to Pasta & Cheese and I took out a jar from the refrigerator there and I dropped it and it hit the floor the right way to open it and the top came off and marinara sauce went all over and all over me it was so embarrassing. They said not to worry about it. it is never happened to me before. We went down to Lafayette to Bob Rauschenberg's party and on the way we ran into Henry Post. Lady McCrady was there and she is doing drawings at the Hellfire Club which is a straight club where girls lead the men around on leashes and things and it is piss and shit for straights. Left there at 12:30. Went to Studio 54 where there was a birthday party for the black star on Saturday Night Live who is just signed to do a movie with Paramount. Eddie Murphy. And he is sort of handsome. The place was jammed but with nobodies.
"Saturday, April 4, 1981","[Jon Gould, Malcolm McLaren, Vivienne Westwood]",-0.125,-Paris I took a Valium and almost took a nap but then there were lots of phone calls and we invited people over for drinks-like a guy named Yorgan I think brought two funny people from England-Vivienne Westwood who designs clothes and Malcolm McLaren who managed the Sex Pistols. After going to dinner and then Club 78 at 78 Rue something and the Privilege we got home at 4:00 in the morning and I called Jon Gould at Paramount Pictures in L.A. when I was drunk and I think I said a lot of wrong things.
"Saturday, April 5, 1980","[Francesco Scavullo, Kim D'Estainville, Sean Byrnes]",-0.014276695526695526,-Paris We went to Kim D'Estainville's new shop near the Arc de Triomphe. A funny neighborhood. Kim's recuperating from his play folding on Broadway. There was nobody in town to try to sell ads to. We had dinner at Club Sept (cab $4). We had a big table and we were disappointed there were models there but all the good-looking ones had been invited off to glamorous places and the ones leftover in town were not that good-looking. We were there for an hour about and then Francesco Scavullo and Sean Byrnes came in and they sat down with us we invited them to dinner. And then Francesco told me about all the dirty things he heard I did at Studio 54 and I just could not believe it all the boys he heard I brought home to the house and I just was shocked I mean I do not know where he got his information and I was just trying to find out where he got his gossip from so I could figure out why they would say all those untrue things. Oh and he told me Studio 54 shut down-that was the first time we got the news. Steve and Ian sold it. So the end of an era. And we also heard that Halston went to Xenon with Bianca so that is a first. And Bonds clothing store is going to reopen soon as a discotheque on Broadway. Scavullo paid for dinner-I did not want him to because I would invited him but he did.
"Saturday, April 7, 1984",[Julian Lennon],-0.02,Benjamin and his roommate Rags heard that there was a birthday party for Julian Lennon at the Be-Bop Cafe so we decided to crash that. Got a limo that was $3 per person ($20). Got there and pretended we thought it was open for regular business. And somebody tried to introduce me to Julian Lennon but he just looked at me and did not have much reaction and so we left and then on the street we ran into a kid who asked us if we were going to Area and we said yes and took him with us. And at Area I held up the walls for a few hours.

David Whitney said why did not I get one of those paint rollers that you roll flower designs on the wall with so I went to paint stores and finally one place could have one for me on Monday so I will send Ronnie up (cabs $2.00 $2.15 $1.60). Bob said let us take Mick and Jerry out and entertain them and so we invited them for dinner at La Grenouille. We had a good time we got drunk (dinner $320). Then we went with Mick back to the Pierre because he wanted to take his sneakers off-why is everybody wearing sneakers? Why do not they make them in dark colors so they could be dress shoes they would be so comfortable. Jerry complained that the Pierre made a big point of calling her Miss Hall all the time and finally she and Mick were deciding that they should really go to a new place. Because Mick had always been at the Pierre with Bianca. It took them long enough to figure that out. Anyway they are going to move to the Carlyle. Mick wanted us to hear his new record and we were going to bring it over to Studio 54 but it was at Earl McGrath's house so we went over there (cab $4). Jann and Jane Wenner were there and Stephen Graham who had something wrapped in foil in his pocket. It looked like drugs but it turned out to be a Rice Crispie cookie. We went to Studio 54 and when we got there it was already so late I did not realize it. And Jane and Steve Graham had said they would do anything for a Quaalude so I got some from Steve but then I got scared-I am never going to do anything like that again. it is bad image. And by the way Bob says he saw me put a little coke on my gums when we were in Mick's room but I did not really. I mean my finger was in my mouth but uh ... okay so I did not leave there until 4:00. When I got home the dogs woke up and started barking and so they notified Jed what time I was coming home.

When they brought the Pope's body out everybody standing around there in Rome clapped all these people because it was such a good production. There've been 262 popes already. is not that a lot? they are usually so old when they get to be Pope that they only last about fifteen years.

We picked up Christopher and Peter and went out to the Meadowlands to see Blondie and before them on the bill was Duran Duran and also David Johansen. We went back to see her. And Chris Stein has lost thirty pounds he is been sick I think it is all this bad air from some air conditioners. Debbie's so fat now she kicked us out because she wanted to get dressed in her Stephen Sprouse clothes. Our seats were up in the concessionaire's box and that was fun. I took pictures of the mother the wife and the kid three generations of concessionaires (hot dogs $20). And the milk shakes were so thick they must have been plastic it was like drinking margarine. Marianne Faithfull came along and read a poem she wrote and somebody put down drugs and she said ""Oh do not put down drugs because I am on cocaine right now."" And I did like her so much she was much different than when she stopped by the office a few weeks ago with Jay Johnson. She was so intelligent and so together. And she did not have an English accent she was like an American and so alert and not out of it at all."

We got there and it was all beautiful straight models dressed to the hilt accessorized with jewelry and T-shirts torn just the right way like Weber photographs and they all look like they just fell out of a magazine. And the right age like twenty-eight to thirty. They parked their motorcycles out front. And beautiful girls too. This place overflowed onto the sidewalk it was so chic. I could have stayed there longer but we left at 2:30 (drinks $40).

There were two TVs but no clickers. And the bathroom was worse than a 1950s Holiday Inn. I do not know how a girl could manage in it-I was not doing too well myself. There was no light. But they had a new gadget in there I think it might have been a hairdryer. Or maybe it was just a phone. And the security at the Beverly Hills looks like it- at the Bel Air they just blend in. Steve Rubell decided not to go over with us to see Dolly Parton. He stayed in bed and made phone calls. You know it is odd to watch Steve because it is like he is trying so hard to be ""a character."" Like the way he eats his ketchup and his Coca-Cola and he repeats over and over that these are the things he likes and that this is the way he likes them. So that people will remember him as ""a character."" it is like he might have read a book on how to be remembered and make an impression and he is doing everything it said. he will order the food and then let it sit there. And we all ordered ice and he made this big thing about waiting till the bottom melted and then sucking it out saying that is what he liked to do because when his father used to buy him ices when he was little that is what he did. Got a cab over to see Dolly Parton at Sandy Gallin's. Dolly does not want anyone to know where she lives because she is had death threats. So we were there and I guess Dolly was appalled that we brought as many people but Keith and everybody had wanted to have a totally star-filled day. Sandy Gallin had the spots measured where he wanted the portraits to go on the walls and everything. And then we walked back to the hotel. Called Cher's number and it was a recording that said that anyone calling this private number was automatically invited to the barbecue going on there. So we went over to Cher's and the door opened and they let us in but we could see that Cher and her boyfriend were shocked to see us. And Cher served good pork and beans and she would not say what the secret was and finally she admitted it was that she opened a can of Campbell's and poured in a lot of hot sauce. The little Allman boy Elijah was being a brat and going around cutting the buds off every flower any one that was just about to open. And Cher was funny she told a story about this crane that came and stayed two days and ate all the fish. And then later on we went to Lisa Love's and she said ""Gee a crane just landed in my yard and he is eating all the fish."" So the crane gets around. And she told us that at the wedding Madonna had asked her how to cut the cake. Cher said ""As if I know."" And then Madonna was asking people if she should put the cake on plates and she was just handing it to everyone in her hand. You know being ""earthy."" And there was a copy of the Star there that had this story about Cher in it. And somehow everybody wound up reading it. And Cher was upset because it said she never bathed. And it said ""Next week: Cher's meeting with Jackie Kennedy."" And nobody wanted to ask if she would ever had one or not. And Cher talked about meeting me in an airport in someplace like Atlanta in '65. On one of our first tours. She was with Sonny. David Horii that new Interview illustrator came to dinner with us at Mr. Chow's and I was telling Fred that David was very good and Fred was in one of those moods he said ""I would have to see his work. I have not seen his portfolio."" And I said ""Well Fred I am telling you this person is very good"" (dinner $530). And then we went to Brad Branson's. He was Paul Jasmin's assistant and now he is a photographer too. It turned out they had the best time there because they took Keith and everybody to a porno store where they got a spray called ""Fart"" and they sprayed it in the car and everybody had to jump out (hotel tips $50)."

I saw Ron Delsener and he invited us to the party for Prince at the Palladium. Prince left in a limo the second the show was over. We went into the Mike Todd Room and it was just almost empty tables set up reserved and there in a white coat and pink bellbottoms like a Puerto Rican at a prom all by himself was Prince. He was just great that image of him being weird and always with the bodyguards and everything was just dispelled and he came over to each and every person and shook their hand and said he was so happy they came and he danced with each and every girl-all these weird girls in sixties dresses. Literally with every girl and he was not even a good dancer. And he remembered names like he said ""So glad you came Wilfredo."" What manners! And Wilfredo was in heaven. We asked Prince if he would be our December cover and he said we would have to talk to his manager and we said that we would asked the manager and the manager said to ask him and so they said they would work it out. We were just shaking it was so exciting. And Billy Idol was there and you know seeing these two glamour boys it is like boys are the new Hollywood glamour girls like Harlow and Marilyn. So weird."

He said he would send a car for me to come to dinner but I said I would walk over so I did. And we sat there and then in the other room were three bodyguards that Halston had hired because Victor threatened to come and break all the windows from the outside. You know Victor is saying he loves Halston too much to stand by and let him get so grand but I mean it is Halston who works so hard and if he wants to get grand then he can do it. I know though that the drugs do take over so I guess that is what is wrong with Victor. And Halston called Victor's brother who lives in town to go and help him but the brother said ""I do not want to interfere in my brother's life."" Oh and Chris had come over to the office and told me everything that I wanted to hear. He said ""Oh it is over between Brian and me. we are not doing it anymore because we are tired of each other.""

Ran into Claudia Cohen on Central Park South where she lives with forty-foot ceilings and we decided to be Puerto Ricans and sit on a stoop and gossip. She told me that that big Joan Hackett/Marsha Mason ""girlfriends"" rumor that got all over town was started by Bobby Zarem because he got mad at Joan Hackett who was his client.

He gave stock answers. We kept asking him how it felt to be an idol with thousands of girls screaming and he was insisting that it did not change you and then we walked through the lobby through the screaming girls and (laughs) he changed. He was so different. The limo came and he had a whole different personality. We went downtown because he was going to be photographed for Interview by Barry McKinley. Shaun just turns into something else when he is being photographed something just happens to him he just falls in love with himself. And Barry has a different style of saying things when he is photographing-instead of saying things like Scavullo and those people say like ""Marvelous marvelous"" Barry says (laughs) ""Give it to me motherfucker. Push it out. Push out all you can."" ""What kind of drug are you on motherfucker?"" It was so unbelievable that I went and taped it. Later at Madison Square Garden in Shaun's dressing room there was a beautiful girl there his girlfriend and he had on stretch pants with his big cock showing and he brought the band in to give them a lecture on when to go slow and how to turn on the thirteen-year-olds. It was funny. When we went out to our seats Shaun's mother Shirley Jones was there and I bent over to say hello where she was sitting and she looked scared but then I said ""I am Andy Warhol"" and she grabbed my hand and was sweet and she introduced me to her husband Marty Ingels. Then Shaun came on. He jumped through a hoop like a lion and the girls went crazy. They took me on stage and it was the first time I was ever on stage at the Garden. Smart little girls were screaming: ""Andy."" And he does sexy things with the microphone he puts it between his legs and he touches his cock a little and he is like a Mick Jagger for the young kids."
"Saturday, August 30, 1986","[Charles Ludlam, Judy Holliday, Kevin Dornan, Marc Balet, Mitzi Newhouse, Ron Galella, Sean Penn]",0.07083333333333333,"Martin called me in the morning and he wanted to give me his ticket to Madonna's play. he would already seen it and was too tired to sit through it again but he said he would meet me afterwards and take me to the party at Sardi's. Worked till 7:00. Went to the Mitzi Newhouse Theater (cab $6). The best thing about the play was the costumes which were done by Kevin Dornan who was once the fashion editor at Interview our first. Madonna changes outfits all the time from one beautiful one to another one. And Sean Penn wore a gun holster and fuschia socks and shoes. The play was like a Charles Ludlam abstract. Madonna was good when she was not trying to be Judy Holliday or Marilyn. She chewed gum through the whole two hours and I did too. She was blowing bubbles and everything. They did not do any curtain calls. Liza was there and I went over and said hello and after reading in the Enquirer that she weighed 200 pounds she was not fat at all really. Marc Balet was there and I got mad at Kevin because here he would gotten Marc two tickets and had not offered me one. After the play Martin met me backstage and there was a big candy chocolate leg there from Kron and everybody was eating it and Martin was too. And it is so sad he has sores all over his face but it was kind of great to see Madonna eating the leg too and not caring that she might catch something. Martin would bite and then Madonna would bite. I like Martin he is sweet. We went in Madonna and Sean's limo to Sardi's. The big bodyguards were with them and they said to the photographers ""If you take one picture we will kill you."" And there was Ron Galella and I felt bad but what could I do? Warren Beatty came over and said ""Hi how are ya?"" He looks old he does not look good but I think he looks unattractive on purpose because if he just did a few things he could be a knockout again. At 2:00 I left and went to Broadway myself and got a cab and none of the photographers cared because I was alone (cab $6)."
"Saturday, August 4, 1979",[Rupert Jason Smith],-0.02081930415263749,Picked up Rupert down at his place on White Street. Rupert's trying to buy the building his loft is in. Actually it is two buildings-the one he is in and the one next to it. I guess Rupert has plenty of money or he would not be thinking about buying buildings. His mother's from Palm Beach but she just looks like a mother. When Rupert went in drag to a party once he looked just like his mother. Rupert Jason Smith. I went out and got cheese and candy for my birthday on Monday and then went back upstairs and worked with Rupert for about four hours. Then we cabbed down to Christopher Street ($2) and wandered around there seeing what is new.
"Saturday, August 4, 1984","[Anthony Quinn, Marina Schiano, Michael Jackson, Rosanna Arquette, Susan Blond]",-0.01677631578947368,"Worked all afternoon till 7:00. Susan Blond called and said that we could go to maybe meet Michael Jackson in a hotel room before his concert at Madison Square Garden. So we cabbed to the Penta Hotel ($5). it is the hotel that was called the Statler Hilton until last week or something and now it is the Penta. But the cab would not go near the place because of the mobs for Michael so he let us off and we had to walk. Finally we found the place we got Elevator B and went up and Calvin was there and he was mad that he would come so early. And Marina Schiano was with him and his girlfriend Kelly. And Rosanna Arquette the actress came up and was so sweet and I asked her if we would ever done anything on her in Interview and she said ""No and you have just got to!"" But then I remembered that we had done something-but just a ""First Impression."" Little Sean Lennon was there and that was exciting. And then this apparition appeared and it was Michael Jackson. Susan Blond pushed me into his arms and he was shy and then people pushed me away and Keith gave him T-shirts and everybody was meeting everybody and then I was pushed back at him and it was anticlimactic and then it was over. I shook his hand and it was like foam rubber. The sequined glove is not just a little sequined glove it is like a catcher's mitt. Everything has to be bigger than life for the stage. We went to the show and it was laser beams and a movie where a sword had to be pulled out of a stone and Michael pulled it out. Bianca arrived late and the Jackson father was in her seat and she did not know who he was and tried to kick him out but Susan Blond got up and gave her her seat. And then after the concert we called Mr. Chow's to see if they would be open and they said yes that they had leftover food. And at Mr. Chow's we were next to Anthony Quinn and he said hi and I did not know if I should go over to his table I never know so I played it shy but then when he was leaving he came over and sort of hugged me and I remembered that he is an artist that he paints."
"Saturday, August 5, 1978","[Candy Darling, Jimmy Slattery]",-2.7755575615628915e-18,I cabbed to the nail place ($3.20). Getting my nails done was $46.80 plus I gave a $10 tip to the Cuban lady who told me all about herself and did a rotten job on my nails. They serve drinks there to the customers and one boy who works there said he did Candy Darling's first perm when she was fifteen. I wonder how old Candy was when she stopped being Jimmy Slattery and just wore dresses all the time. Walked back to the house. Catherine called from Montauk and she was sober. She said that Tom had about thirty people out there shooting Cocaine Cowboys and that the toilets were backing up. She pretended to know that Tom had just married Winnie. And Mr. Winters called Vincent going crazy about all the people. Tom moved out to the hotel at the yacht club so Catherine was happy-she spent the day there ordering from room service and watching TV.
"Saturday, August 8, 1981",[Jane Holzer],-0.05468749999999999,Jane Holzer called and said that I should come over to 4 East 66th Street where a kid who goes to Columbia Film School and a group of his friends were filming an underground movie with expensive 3 5mm equipment. I went over and got depressed because here it was twenty years after my underground movies and here were young pretty rich kids-even richer and in bigger apartments than the kids who'd been in my movies. And we could hear them saying that they did not want the old people in front. I got sort of depressed and left.
"Saturday, August 9, 1980",[Bill Schwartz],-0.05659722222222221,"Vincent was at the office with his whole TV crew. Don Munroe and everybody. They filmed me doing some introductions to the shows he is shot to give me a bigger presence in the programs. I think they are going to call it Andy Warhols TV. it is interviews with people-just the people talking to the camera. Painted at the office till 8:00. Bill Schwartz called he is in town from Atlanta for the Democratic convention and he asked me for dinner he is staying at the Mayfair House. Glued and walked over to the Mayfair House. When I got there a man signing in said ""You painted my wife."" And I did not recognize him and then his wife was there and I did not recognize her either. It was awful because there were not too many people around. she would dyed her hair blonde and that threw me. It was Mr. and Mrs. H&R Block. And I was looking so squarely at them. It was really bad. I invited them down to the office."
"Saturday, December 1, 1984","[Chris Makos, Grace Glueck, Kenny Scharf, Tony Shafrazi]",0.14423905723905725,"Picked up Jon and cabbed down to the Tony Shafrazi Gallery for Kenny Scharf's show ($8). The blond kid who tells people he is my lover was there. And the kid told me that he is the one who is been planting flowers outside my house. I pretended that I did not even know anybody was putting them in but I have seen him there. And Kenny's paintings are now going for $30000 and so Keith felt funny because they are both with Tony's gallery but Keith's never wanted his prices to be too high. His go for eight ten fifteen. Then afterwards there was a dinner for Kenny at Area. The new theme over there is ""Religion"" they are trying to take over the Limelight theme. And the front page of the Sunday Times ""Arts and Leisure"" section is plastered with Schnabel Grace Glueck calling him better than Pollock. The dinner was fun. Kenny sold all his pictures. Then I went to the dance floor and toured saw the burning crosses and things. Benjamin's friend Bernard was St. Sebastian. Keith and Kenny were going to do more work on their article for Interview. Gael told me she took out the part where Kenny asked Keith if it was true he went to bed with Chris Makos in order (laughs) to meet me."
"Saturday, December 12, 1981","[Jade Jagger, Jane Holzer, Steve Rubell]",0.1036111111111111,Halston called and invited me to dinner for Jade Jagger. Brought Jade a Dollar Sign painting. Bianca is trying to be a Communist she is a Nicaraguan guerrilla now. Halston was funny telling her how beautiful she looked and how rich her clothes were and I told her I would just been to see Mrs. Marcos and she said how could I and I said that if the Marcos regime fell it would just be another Iran. Steve Rubell was there and Ian came and Ian is having an affair with Jane Holzer which I did not know about but he thought I did so he was talking as if I knew trying to pump me about Jane. But he was after Bianca too he wanted to drop her off. Calvin called a couple of times for Steve. Calvin's kind of great. He does anything he wants-he takes ads in Interview and in WWD and he goes to 54 and to Xenon-he does not let anyone push him around. Bianca's going down to testify about Nicaragua in Washington I just do not know what she is thinking she is doing.
"Saturday, December 13, 1986","[Dennis Hopper, Diane Lane, Matt Dillon, Tony Shafrazi]",0.044476332199546484,"Benjamin picked me up and we went down to Arman's on Washington Street. It was supposed to be for lunch but since I told them I do not eat lunch there (laughs) was not any and I was starved. And I got so jealous he showed me the jewelry he is doing he gets little hearts and redoes them in gold and glues them down. I asked him to be on our TV show. And then I got even more jealous when he told me about the dresses he is making-a ""sleeve dress"" all made of sleeves a ""pocket dress"" all made of pockets. I mean why could not I have thought of those? In his drawings he repeats images but not in his paintings. And he is doing paintings now that are just brushstrokes across. But I always wonder if he copies Cesar. Cesar was the artist in the fifties and sixties a short French guy the one who made the big hands you sit in and things like that. he is still alive. He did the plastic that got bigger and bigger and looked like poop and he sold it by the piece. I wish I would thought of that. I was thinking about that dress that I made for that Rizzoli show that was called ""Fantasy in Fashion""-the one in the early seventies. My thing in it was a dress made out of sewn-together pieces of designer clothes. Somebody wore it to a ball eventually. But the timing was just too early I guess because the bluejean jacket thing a few weeks ago at Barneys for the AIDS benefit that was sort of the same thing. Corice set it up for me to get a French visa. I took Benjamin to lunch the lady cut the sandwich in half and it fell on the floor and she laughed and I do not know if she charged me for it ($19). We ate in the car on the way to the studio. Paige was meeting me there before we went down to Dennis Hopper's show at Tony Shafrazi's gallery. And Dennis's show the photographs were nothing special I guess Tony just wanted publicity with a movie star. Met Keith and Kenny there they were fun. Paige was peeved when she took a picture of Keith and then he said (laughs) ""Oh Andy why do not you sign this for me?"" Matt Dillon was there with a blonde girl who looked like a young Diane Lane. Diane Lane's only like twenty but this girl was even younger. Everybody kept telling Dennis how great he was in Blue Velvet. I tried to get him to be on our TV show but he was leaving town the next day."
"Saturday, December 15, 1984",[],-0.02359307359307359,Got up early had to go to work. Had Jay come in and Rupert. During the week it is impossible to work at the new place it is just people coming through and gawking all the time. I bought three Cabbage Patch dolls on the street with their birth certificates. A boy and two girls (3 X $80 = $240). And they wanted to wrap them so that I would not be attacked for them on the street. Got research books ($180).
"Saturday, December 16, 1978",[],0.04360119047619048,"Halston said I was invited up to Dr. Giller's and that he would pick me up. Put my contacts in and Halston arrived in a cab. I told him it was the first time I ever saw him in a cab and then he got embarrassed and then I was embarrassed I said that I always take them that cabs are great but then he explained for the rest of the ride how he takes cabs a lot but that I just do not see him because having the car sit around all day is expensive and then I was even more embarrassed. And he told me that any time I see his car outside 54 when it is late to just take it home. Dr. Giller's place is an exact miniature copy of Halston's. The same paintings the same layout the same colors. What Halston's been most upset about in the Studio 54 bust is that the IRS agents discovered another little room that nobody knew about and Halston is hurt because he is such a close friend and Steve had not told him about it. Steve says it was an inside tipoff because nobody knew about the room except the people who work there. But Steve and Ian are kind of mean when they fire people so it could have been anybody. At Studio 54 later I asked Potassa if she would ever had sex with Dali and she said ""No he just picked my cock up once and kissed it."" She said Dali was coming back to town and that we had to resume our friendship. And Potassa only drinks champagne. ""Schom-pon-ye."" She said when Dali kissed her cock he said ""Magnifico!"""
"Saturday, December 17, 1983","[Bo Polk, George Plimpton]",-0.05361772486772486,"There was lunch with Bo Polk at ""21."" I asked Jon if he wanted to go. Picked him up and we went to 52nd and Fifth. Got out of the cab ($5) and happened to turn my head and saw this car running down about fifty people. People were being thrown up in the air. It was like a movie scene. And when the car stopped there were people lying all over the sidewalk and other people screaming and running. It made me really sick. Jon ran over to try to help. Some people who were not hit were trying to help the others but there were other people trying to get Cartier packages away from people who'd been hit. Jon found this boy on the ground who did not have anybody with him he was from Yale and he asked Jon to slip his Cartier package in his inside pocket so no one would steal it. Ambulances got there in just a second though. Lots of Empire ambulances. Where do they come from so fast I wonder. It was chaos. And I was standing next to George Plimpton and I asked him if he was going down to the lunch but he did not answer me he was being grand. When Jon was done I thought he would have blood all over him but he did not. Then later on after seeing on the news about all these other disasters the bomb at Harrod's and the fire in Madrid it was great that not one person in this Fifth Avenue thing was badly injured. And what happened it turned out was that a traffic cop told this guy in the passenger seat of some car in front of Doubleday to move and the guy could not drive but I guess his foot just went onto the accelerator accidentally because they did not charge him with anything. So it was all really odd and I can still see it in my eyes. It could have been us or anything. At ""21"" the hat-check girl said ""I know who you are."" And I thought she was making a reference to my dirty coat which the other day they had not even wanted to check they just threw it on the floor. But later on she asked me for my autograph so I guess that was why she said it. After lunch walked up Madison still feeling peculiar because of the accident."
"Saturday, December 18, 1976","[Bianca Jagger, David Bourdon, Delfina Rattazzi, Karen Lerner, Paul Morrissey, Robin West, Sisi Cahan]",0.12013403263403263,"Went shopping for office gifts at Bonwit's and Bendel's then went over to Quo Vadis for lunch to introduce Robin West and Delfina Rattazzi to each other. I had thought Catherine liked him from the weekend at the Wyeths' but she said she did not mind that she wanted to give him up to Delfina or something. And Delfina liked him she was aggressive-it was the first time I ever heard her say ""My family is in the airplane manufacturing business"" because usually she pretends she is so poor. Robin's a flier. Saw Karen Lerner and Sisi Cahan having lunch and I figured out it probably was Karen Lerner who just sold her Flower prints because David Bourdon just got some cheap at Parke Bernet. Went home and Bianca called and said she was going to be packing at the Pierre and then taking her stuff over to her and Mick's new place on 72nd. Went to the Pierre and she packed and packed and around midnight she was done and we went up and she turned off the alarm and we went in. It must be costing them a fortune this little house. The people had just had it redone and it was all painted and with new furniture and I would like to see it after the Jaggers have it for a year. After we were there for a while Bianca turned on the alarm and went out to the airport to get a plane for Montauk she wanted to get back out there because it was so beautiful. [""Montauk"" refers to the oceanfront property in Montauk New York at the easternmost tip of Long Island that Andy bought in partnership with Paul Morrissey in 1971. The property included one main lodge-type house with three smaller ones plus the home of the caretaker Mr. Winters. Mick and Bianca Jagger were at this time renting the place from Andy and Paul] Jade was still out there."

I was taking pictures of this handsome kid I thought was a model and then I was embarrassed because it turned out to be John-John Kennedy. Fred brought him and Mary Richardson. And Chris Makos was there taking party pictures. And Debbie Harry gave me a present and she said to open it up and I said no that I would wait till I got home and I am glad that I did because I just do not know what it is. it is this black thing. I wonder if it is a cock ring because it is rubber with a stick on it but it has this one piece that does not make sense. Monique's getting ready to push her book and she wants the cover of Interview which actually might be fun.
"Saturday, December 21, 1985",[],0.30624999999999997,Called PH and said I would gone to Jean's and gotten her the earrings she was in love with and that I would pick her up to go to Vincent's Christmas party and give them to her (cab $6.50). I did not like these earrings at first but I now think they may be Schiaparelli I really do. She was thrilled she did not think she would be getting the pin too. And when she put them on they did something for her they are unusual-strands of gold that bounce around with rubies in the center.
"Saturday, December 22, 1984","[David Daine, Kent Klineman]",0.05,Went to David Daine's the hair stylist. Kent Klineman Hedy's husband was there and all he sees in me is a tax shelter and all I see in him is a check. I do not know if the deal for a Cowboys and Indians portfolio he wants to commission is going to fall through because I will not do it as a tax shelter. we will see.
"Saturday, December 23, 1978",[Christopher Walken],-0.10000000000000002,Talked to Tinkerbelle and she was saying how she makes out with everybody she interviews that she was making out with Christopher Walken and that his wife was getting upset. She said she cut her arm falling on the glass from a skylight-she would broken into a friend's apartment-she thought they had some drugs in there. I guess Tinkerbelle's really wild.
"Saturday, December 24, 1983","[Cheryl Tiegs, Diane Von Furstenberg, Peter Beard, Steve Rubell]",0.11916666666666667,Halston's place was really Christmasy. Victor was behaving himself. Bianca was there with Jade and Peter Beard and Cheryl Tiegs and Jennifer and Jay from the office and Halston's niece. No Steve Rubell. Dinner was delicious cranberries and turkey and I porked. Halston gave me an old dress it weighed like 4000 pounds. And the presents were not really that great-it was not like the other Christmas Eves there. Bianca made a faux pas she asked me if I was going to Diane Von Furstenberg's and I had not been invited. So I guess I am off her list. She must have chosen Bob over me. Well then she missed a Christmas present. I do not know it was never that much fun there anyway. Benjamin was trying to get me to leave so he could go off and have fun so he got me out of there by 12:00 and walked me home. I just lallied around feeling blue. Took a Valium and forgot about the world.
"Saturday, December 25, 1976","[Bob Colacello, Delia Doherty, Jay Johnson, Kitty Miller, Nick Scott, Paloma Picasso, Rusty Holzer]",-0.04791666666666666,"Went out to Westbury to C.Z. Guest's for lunch. It was a magazine Christmas-the decorations and the food and the house were just like a spread in McCall's or House and Garden like what a house should look like on Christmas. But you would think with all C.Z.'s involvement with flowers and gardening that she would have real stuff but when you looked close the wreaths and things were half plastic. C.Z. gave everyone her bug repellent for gifts. Ninety-year-old Kitty Miller was there she is still putting blue shoe polish in her hair. The pies were great-apple mince and plum. The turkey had already been cut up like a magazine would tell you to before it got to the table so it was like a Turkey Puzzle. Kitty was drunk and when the Spanish ambassador said a few words she screamed ""I can not speak Spanish."" It started to snow a little. Said thanks and left to go home to get ready for the Jaggers'. Got to East 66th and glued [see Introduction]. Went up to East 72nd (cab $2.50). We were one of the first to arrive. Nick Scott was at the door working. This was a job he would come up with to earn money-being the Jaggers' houseboy. Only he was supposed to get there at 8:00 in the morning to help and he did not arrive until 6:00 at night. I gave Jade the grey kitten from Rusty Holzer. She looked at it and said "" 'Lydia?'... No. Harriet."" I felt sorry for the cat though because I think it is going to have a horrible home. I do not know. Mick sat down next to Bob Colacello and put his arm around him and offered him a pick-me-up and Bob said ""Why yes I am rather tired"" and just as he was about to get it Yoko and John Lennon walked in and Mick was so excited to see them that he ran over with the spoon that he was about to put under Bob's nose and put it under John Lennon's. Halston and Loulou de la Falaise put a lot of the pick-me-up in a covered dish on the coffee table and when someone they liked would sit down they would tell them ""Lift it up and get a surprise."" Paloma Picasso was there. Jay Johnson brought Delia Doherty. The dinner was terrific. Mick and Bianca forgot to bring out the dessert though."
"Saturday, December 25, 1982",[],-0.18571428571428572,Got up late. Went to church. Had a miserable Christmas. Got Benjamin to come into the office before he went home to San Francisco (cab $5). Worked with him all afternoon trying to get my bills paid. Heard about the big snow out in Denver. Gave Benjamin cash for working that day ($100).
"Saturday, December 28, 1985","[Carole Davis, George Condo, Kenny Scharf, Matt Dillon, Susan Blond]",0.02045454545454545,Susan Blond called and we made a date for dinner and by the end of the day I would invited ten or eleven people and I decided that Bud's would be cheaper than say Jams and so we decided to go there (cab $6). George Condo came and he is that new artist. He makes these small things. And George and Paige were hitting it off but then Kenny Scharf had invited this actress Carole Davis for George and she got there late after dinner-and she played the Jewish girl in The Flamingo Kid. So George got confused about who was his date. And this girl was the hit of the dinner. She was really funny. She just broke up with an Armenian or Indian plastic surgeon in L.A. who'd done three generations of noses she said and she talked about her chin job but I think she is had a nose job too. She said her best scene was cut out of The Flamingo Kid when she tries to give Matt Dillon an ice-cube blow job. She said Matt did not relate to her (dinner $600 including tip). Bernard dropped me off ($10). And there is really no American cabdrivers anymore. This one was from Afghanistan or something. Is it that these people are willing to risk their lives and Americans are not?
"Saturday, December 29, 1979",[Suzie Frankfurt],-0.03125,Bianca called and Suzie Frankfurt called but I could not remember their numbers so I did not call them back. I should really keep an address book. And then I had a glass of wine or so and I watched a little TV and I was tired so I fell asleep.
"Saturday, December 4, 1982","[Charles Evans, Sidney Pollack, Teri Garr]",0.10729166666666667,I invited Curley to see Tootsie. We could not get in at first they were giving us a hard time there were not tickets for us that Charles Evans was supposed to leave. And if I would known at that time that I was actually in the movie which I did not even get paid for-that I appear on the cover of People magazine with Tootsie when she gets famous-I would have been pushier and said I could take in as many people as I wanted. And the movie they play it really straight Dustin does. it is not really like a drag queen it is like having an aunt that you did not know was a man. it is something else entirely. Then we went over to Charles Evans's. It was packed with stars so we sat by the food so we would see everybody. Dustin was sweet and the director Sidney Pollack was too. I talked to Teri Garr who was great in the movie and we talked about Henry Post and does he have gay cancer- that is the rumor. And Curley got me to drink. I had vodka.
"Saturday, December 6, 1980","[Doria Reagan, Joe Dallesandro, Lily Auchincloss]",0.09425779534475186,I called Bob to see if our dinner with Ron and Doria Reagan was on and he said it was. Rupert was there waiting at the office when I got there and Jay came in. And then Joe Dallesandro called from California somewhere around Sacramento I think. He was calling for money of course he said he was in a truck with his mother they live in a truck or a trailer I do not know. I told him he should go to Los Angeles and be discovered. it is so absolutely boring-he never calls and says do you want to do something together it is just always for money. Worked all afternoon. Decided to go Christmas shopping. Rupert took some Interviews and we went down to the Village. People seemed out shopping early. I think this is going to be the most gigantic Christmas for sales I really do. Country-wide. Ron and Doria were already at Nippon when we got there. The owner took us to one of the private rooms. Ron was in his alligator T-shirt to show off his muscles. The Secret Service jammed the place. The owner kept bringing in toys for us-he gave the Reagans this new kind of bottle-opener gun that opens up and you really could kill somebody with it. Bob asked if we could go to the inauguration in January and they said we would be getting invitations. They said they were going to Bermuda soon and Bob said he was seeing Lily Auchincloss so he would ask if it was okay for them to stay at her house there. Doria's really sweet and charming. Bob was so happy. We left them with the Secret Service and got home-walked-about 12:30 or 1:00 (dinner $200). And life gets more exciting every day but then I had to go home to my horrible home life where the situation with Jed is getting worse every day.
"Saturday, February 1, 1986",[],0.04296296296296297,Paige and I went to Global Furniture-they advertise. There was an umbrella thing as big as a whole room that I am thinking we should get for the Madison Avenue part of the building so that the people across the street can not look down and see me painting. it is such a huge umbrella about 20' X 20'. it is only about $800. We were there all afternoon.

He was working he said and also in the middle of hosting a party for twelve kids he would picked up at the Anvil. Went over to Truman's for his facelifting party. He had to check into the hospital the next morning Sunday and have the lift on Monday but he was not telling anybody which hospital. I had Janet Villella and a ""Du Pont"" twin with me-these two twin brothers who say their name is Du Pont but I think they just made it up. When we got to Truman's Truman was not happy about seeing the twin because once at Studio 54 Jacques Bellini who this twin is in love with had him go over to Truman and say awful things and Truman remembered. The other twin is Rupert's boyfriend. Bob Colacello was there and Bob MacBride and Halston were there and Dr. Giller who said he would tried to call me and gotten very jealous when another man answered the phone. Jed picked up my line. Truman was trying to get me to eat lots of chocolate he thinks I like it so much which I do not really. Commissioner Geldzahler was there with his new boyfriend who is cute. Henry said he told Mayor Koch he wanted a badge for being commissioner so the mayor gave him one. He flashed it. Christopher Isherwood's boyfriend Don Bachardy was there."

I went upstairs and there was no fireplace going and I still smelled burning so I went up to the room on the fourth floor where two kids have been working restoring furniture for Jed's decorating business. I opened the door. There was a dropcloth all over the room with a big burned hole about ten inches across in it and underneath the hole was a quarter-inch hole in the floorboards. I started to shake. My biggest fear had happened. There were open cans of turpentine around the windows were closed and the heat was on. I just do not know what started it and I just do not know what stopped it. It must have happened while I was asleep because I did not smell anything when I came in. Do you think ... ? I mean it was like The Exorcist. Should I put a cross up there? I am going to have a cross blessed and put it up there. Because in the same room once the whole ceiling had a flood on one wall and now this. And then I was thinking that I was mean to my nephew the priest and that was bothering me. And when I looked at where the fire had been right in the center of the room it was like to show what would happen ... I was absolutely shaking. The dropcloth had vein lines going out from the hole and the floor underneath had vein lines. It was so weird. Then I spent the whole morning cleaning up. I called Judith Hollander for the phone number of the boys who were ""restoring."" I called them up and screamed at them to come and get their junk out of there fast and when they came I would not talk to them I was so angry. I was so exhausted from this ordeal in the morning with the fire that after work I just went home and drank some wine so that I would be able to sleep and not think about the possessed room upstairs. Remember when Tom Tryon used to live across the street and I would watch him in his window writing? Now I am living a nightmare like one of his stories."

Carole Bouquet was with him she is leaving for Paris in a week. Then Fred arrived with Cecil Beaton.

He can hardly walk he is paralyzed on one side. he would taken photographs of Carole and signed them for Peter with his left hand which is great that is the hand he draws with now. He does not talk much he just said things like ""Oh my"" and ""Yes."" And I guess Diana looking at him was afraid something like that would happen to her because she overreacted in the other direction she was running and jumping and dancing and humming and pushing forward with her tight body and her beautiful clothes. And Consuelo Crespi whose daughter Pilar is married to a Colombian Echavarria was also at Diana's. Tom knew all about Colombia so I just do not know about him. He said that Pilar's husband was the biggest smuggler in Colombia but what does that mean he smuggles? For sure cocaine? Or money? Echavarria owns an airline there a small one. We were talking about plane crashes and Tom was telling about his-the one that wrecked his hand that he wears the glove on and Consuelo said ""If you crashed in an airplane you were probably in Colombia right?"" And he was. Tom does not seem to take coke too much but I think he was missing Margaret so he was snorting some. he is so free with it it is not like a dealer he gives it away like it is candy.

I did used to think he was good too but then that last time at Lincoln Center it was so boring. it is like artists who do things-well I do not know maybe I fit into that category-but they are showing the mechanicals of something instead of entertaining you.

It starts off with how he arrived from Waco Texas and then being at Max's and who he met. Everybody but me.

And I mean she goes around the city doing her photographs of anybody she wants so where does she have the nerve to act like that? And then she went downstairs and I was talking in a loud voice about how I thought she was a phony and maybe she heard but I do not care. If I see her again I am going to tell her off once and for all what a big phony-baloney she is. Julian had a lot of new work around. he is buying back his early work that he sold for $600 or something for about $40000 because he knows he should.

And Tinkerbelle died. It was in the Friday papers. It said that she died on Tuesday when she jumped out of a window. Edit deAk was wearing one of these Afghan hats and she said that she told Diane Keaton once to ""stop wearing those stupid hats"" and then she comes in wearing a stupid hat herself and runs into Diane Keaton so she was really embarrassed.

Left there and saw a sign that said ""Funeral Home"" and I thought it was a discotheque and started to go in but then they were actually bringing a body in and I freaked out and crossed to the other side of the street."

Peter Wise had decided to give him a hotel room for a present he got him one at that hotel on Central Park South that nobody seems to go to anymore the St. Moritz and so we all went there (cab $3). And Peter was sweet he would brought all Chris's toiletries and Chris loved it he was thrilled. Jon Gould the vice-president from Paramount arrived with an airline steward. I think the roses that I keep sending him at work are embarrassing him so I would better stop. He tries to play it macho. Then we went over to John Reinhold's apartment to see how the decorating job by Michael Graves is coming and it is taken like nine months for one room-they keep making the window either one inch too small or too big so it keeps having to be redone.
"Saturday, January 30, 1982",[Harvey Fierstein],0.11876033057851237,"Jon picked me up and we cabbed to Sheridan Square to see Harvey Fierstein's Torch Song Trilogy (tickets $3 5 cab $7). It was at the Sheridan Square place and the theater was one of those firetraps and it was embarrassing because there were nothing but boys going in and so we went around the block and then when a couple of girls went up to the box office we stood near them. The play was four hours long but it was really funny it had funny lines and everybody loved it everybody laughed. Like the drag queen said ""I have had so many names-Kitty Litter Beef a la Mode...."" And when the play was over the usher said that Harvey Fierstein wanted to see me. I would always had it in the back of my head that somehow he was somebody we knew vaguely but I could not remember and then I met him and he said ""do not you remember me? I was that 500-pound boy who was in your play Pork and look at what I have here-a hit play!"" And he is great his voice got so low. he is appealing and really talented-he wrote and directed it and acts in it. I told him I would try to get Interview to do a story on him because he is new talent. Dropped Jon (magazines and newspapers $10 cab $6). Got to bed around 1:00."

Heather Watts wanted to meet the poorest kid in New York because she is been spending so much time with Anne Bass so Stephen Sprouse brought her a cute messenger who has a twelve-inch tattoo. They put two tables together for us in the front and there was a Mafia-type guy at the bar who said stuff about Stephen's punk hair and Stephen got so scared he left and then Paige went over and started telling the guy off and she almost got it she really almost was history. He was a greaseball a big ox about 6'5"". Huge. So then Peter Martins was obligated to go over and defend Paige and then Jock Soto got up too and all I could think of was that the whole New York City Ballet company would be wiped out by this Mafia bruiser at the bar. It was scary. A lot of talk like ""asshole"" and all those words. Heather loved it. So Peter was a man and defended Paige but after the bruiser left he was so relieved that he sank in his chair and he told her ""Paige I am never going out with you again-you are too much troubled Dropped Wilfredo off and went home to bed (cab $6.50)."

John Samuels invited us to the ballet with his father who is chairman of the board at City Center. Got to the theater and we had good seats in the grand tier or the dress circle. Peter Martins danced and he was good. Bought drinks at intermission ($20). Mr. Samuels took us backstage and the girl who did not marry Balanchine was there. what is her name? Shelly? Shirley? Suzy?

Oh and I heard about about a way to shoplift at the supermarket which I think I am (laughs) going to do-switching the price stickers at the supermarket. Went to the new museum way downtown. It was an automobile show. Real cars mixed in with Ma tisses and Rosenquists. And they had a painting of mine in it that they had labeled a ""Car Crash."" But when I saw it it was not a Car Crash it was a Disaster. The one with the fireman. Should I tell them? How could they not even notice it did not have a car in it. And the show's going on to Detroit. In Detroit they will notice there is no car. But really should I tell them?"

Vincent was calling Montauk because Mr. Winters was failing and Mrs. Winters was upset. I just could not believe that anybody who looked as good as Mr. Winters did was in bad health. But he has been really cranky I think last summer with Tom Sullivan out there really made him cranky. Then Bob called and said that Rod Stewart and Alana Hamilton wanted to see us for dinner and that sounded like a fun thing. I worked at home until 10:00 and then Bob picked me up and we went to Elaine's (cab $2.50). It turned out to be actually Swifty Lazar's dinner party and the Erteguns were there and Rod's manager I think or assistant he was funny talking gay with Bob. Well the party was so stuffy poor Rod looked miserable you could see he really wanted a good time and they all wanted blows and nobody had any. And then Francoise and Oscar de la Renta left and suddenly-it was incredible-everything picked up. Who would think that just two people leaving could do so much-the whole mood of the dinner changed. Rod and Alana had the most beautiful coats. He had black mink and she had a matching white mink. He looked so great-he looked better than she did. Then we went to Studio 54. Truman was there. He goes up into the crow's nest where the DJ plays the records and it is like his private office. People come up to see him and he stays until 8:00. Truman said that Ivan Karp had seen Bob MacBride's art and said he would put him in a group show in December of next year. Rod and Alana were in the back I introduced them to the manager. it is hard to get coke there now they are not really selling it. And some guy was sort of bothering me and John Fairchild Jr. came over and asked if I wanted the guy beaten up and I really should get to know him better because he must have a bad temper which is always interesting.

Went all the way down there to see what people are doing and I got jealous. Bought Keith memorabilia and posters from the show ($95). This is at the Disco annex of the Tony Shafrazi Gallery. Ran into people and it was weird. This Keith thing reminded me of the old days when I was up-there. And then we went to see Lichtenstein's show and he did a mural! I just do not understand that. Right on the wall. Like picking up the graffiti thing from the kids but I think it is so silly why would he want to do that. But somebody told me they will put sheetrock over it and it will be underneath and then someday they will peel it away. So then we went to a duck exhibit a new kind of old art primitives like duck decoys. And then we went to Peter Bonnier's gallery and it was Steve Jaffee's paintings and there is a portrait of Jean Michel Basquiat in it and Jean Michel Basquiat told me that this guy just does it the way I do- tracing.

Bob Rauschenberg was at the opening and Joseph Beuys and Hans Namuth and it was like a busy sixties day. And I forget how attractive artists are. They really are attractive. The stairs were the best place to stand to see people and sign things. Then went over to the Greene Street thing and the heavyweights were there. Rosenquist did not know what to say so he told me he loved the photograph of me.

I worked all afternoon and then Victor came by and we went propping in the Village we went to Utrillo's the used clothes store and left Interviews there. They said that they could sell old issues there if we sent some over. Then we went into the second-hand shops along 6th Avenue and one guy said ""Oh you are the one I sold the stuffed dog to."" And then I went into another shop down the street and the woman there said ""Oh you are the guy I sold the stuffed dog to."" Actually she sold it to Fred. So I said ""How could two places sell us the same stuffed dog?"" and she said ""Oh we used to be partners."" These people just know the price of everything every little piece of fifties junk has a price that they know! And I mean the easiest thing would be to just buy something new and stay in business for ten years and then sell it as an antique. Victor bought these clear plastic chairs from '65-or maybe even later-for $150. Was that a good price? What would something like that sell for new now? And they are nice-looking. Molded. it is things like old Mickey Mouse stuff. Why not just get it new now and do not use it and then you would have it new in ten years instead of the old beat-up things they sell (photo supplies $16.96)."

Silva Mind Control. She was after Jon showing him how to walk like you have a dime up your ass and they did that well. She talks model talk. And she plays the flute. Only three notes. And she does yoga. All those things. She took off her clothes and they were nude sunbathing and fucking the rocks. She had a great body and Jon had one too and Chris is a little fat but it is a good body and I had on my white protector and I was safe except for my feet which got burned because I walked. Had lunch with Halston he was adorable. I tried to read scripts. Took a walk on the beach over by Dick Cavett's. Jon said he had to go back to town but Chris and I convinced him to stay another night. After dinner we watched Grease and at 12:30 I decided to go to bed early.

And so he was going to come up about 6:00 so I could rephotograph him. Then I ran into him again on the beach and all the people on the beach were taking pictures of him. He looked so great without clothes on he is pencil-thin he looks like a muscle man like Mr. America with small biceps and I told him not to ever put any more weight on again. But he was saying he had to because he had to do Rocky III and so I told him to do a fat suit. And so we left to go back to the hotel to refresh ourselves and wait for him to come. Then I glued myself together because it was time to get ready to go down to the opening of the show in the lobby. I was ready before anyone else so I decided I might as well go down and work so I got downstairs about five minutes after 7:00 and Pam Combemale and Freddy Woolworth were standing there greeting people and I was next in line and I shook hands with everybody coming in like a receiving line. They would introduce me and there were all these old bags I mean the oldest people in the world. And then Jamie came down and he was next to me and we went down the line and in it was Raymond Loewy! The guy who designed the Lucky Strike cigarette package and everything else! I was just so thrilled to meet him that I just jumped up and down and asked him if I could take his picture. And he was great. And then the old bags there were just so many of them I could not believe it. I think we got some portraits to do so that is great. Then Stallone came all in white and he looked really beautiful and then Iris Love and Liz Smith came and Liz said it was the chic-est party opening they would ever been to. Mary Richardson came and Kerry Kennedy and Mona Christiansen and a cute little girl Vicky who is the daughter of Frank Gifford. Mona told a story of how Garbo picked her up on Madison Avenue a couple of weeks ago and took her home for tea but then she said nothing happened they just compared face jaw-lines. I do not believe her but it was fun to hear. Mona was feeling up all the girls really feeling them up.

She dropped a whole bowl of spaghetti at lunch and just picked it up and put it back in another bowl with the glass in it and everything and then served it to the people who came later like Kenny Lane. They barbecued beef but it started raining. They dropped a bowl of raspberries and picked them up too. Pretty table setting and grand. So dirty in the kitchen with children and dogs and maids. People with babies serving. Catherine really did a lot of the work herself.

Bobby Zarem's office had been calling wanting me to go down there but when you are with that many big celebrities you never get any publicity. Later on that night Jack Nicholson introduced Bob Dylan and called him ""transcendental."" But to me Dylan was never really real-he was just mimicking real people and the amphetamine made it come out magic. With amphetamine he could copy the right words and make it all sound right. But that boy never felt a thing-(laughs) I just never bought it. Someone gave me a copy of Leo Ford's sex video and I put it on when I got into bed and he was massaging this limp sausage of his for so long and there was another guy there doing the same thing with his limp one and I fell asleep and when I woke up they were (laughs) still doing it."

Went to see Young Doctors in Love (tickets $10) and it was really good (cab $3). It was directed by Garry Marshall who I did not know was an old guy. And there was a funny scene where the guy in the Calvin Klein ad is wheeled into the operating room in his jeans in the same position he is in in the ads and so that is funny if you get it. Not everybody gets it.

I think it sounds funnier than it is going to be unless she can really do a lot of good menus."

Victor had a ""big black number"" coming over to his house that he wanted me to photograph as a ""landscape"" so we cabbed back ($3.60). Then the big black number called and said he would not be there for hours so Victor and I cabbed to Studio 54 ($3). It was filled with beautiful people.

And I would just seen Urban Cowboy on TV a couple of times and she was so slim in it and now she has those wide Texas hips. Clarisse Rivers was there really fun. And Earl McGrath was funny. Mick happened to sit near me. Jed was there and I think he was with Alan Wanzenberg and actually I think it was Alan who was sitting next to me but I was not absolutely sure.

Then we decided to do the discos. Halston was the most fun person on the trip. He would call up every place and say ""Hello this is Steve Rubell the owner of Studio 54. Can I get in free?"" He was just camping the whole time-the tour guide. Bianca had to wear all her Halstons while he was in London and she was unhappy because Mick had called her and had a fight about Jade. He said he can have more children and she can not and she got insulted and said she could. They do use Jade as a prop and they make each other really unhappy. He wanted Jade to come over for his birthday but Bianca did not want to let her she said it was bad publicity with the Pallenberg boyfriend's suicide.

John Forsythe told me he bid on a portrait but dropped out at $25000. Now would be such a good time to really go after the Hollywood crowd because now they see that the portraits at this auction went for $40000 so they would know that $25000 was a bargain. If we only had somebody in L.A. to follow up on this. Bob Colacello would have been so good at this. Jack Nicholson was there all weekend we saw him everywhere. he is fat now. Jack Scalia gave me his phone number for Italian dinner at his house in L.A. Afterwards I told Dionne Warwick that I met her twenty years ago at a Brooklyn Fox rock and roll show and she remembered and I am not surprised because it was so odd-I was with Isabel Eberstadt who was doing an article for maybe Vogue and she was talking to Dionne in her breathy society voice like Jackie's.

But Ian Schrager as he read it got more interested but the thing he kept asking questions about was Paraphernalia. Dozens of questions about Paraphernalia-who owned it who designed it who really owned it. And it is the most unimportant thing in the book. I guess he was sort of interested because of Norma Kamali although I do not think they are still seeing each other. The kids with beautiful bodies were playing the pinball machines in town. It looked like all the movies I have been seeing like Porky s they were just beautiful. Gosman's was too crowded with old people so we went to a local place where there were kids and models and that was $40. Got a toothbrush ($2) at White's the drugstore. Went back and watched TV and talked intellectual. Read the good art books that Victor always has around. Steve Rubell and Ian had gone to East Hampton to play tennis with Steve's brother and they brought back corn and came just in time for dinner and all Steve could rave about was the corn because he brought it.

There were lots of new trucks I can not tell which are the real farmers and which are the people who buy the stuff someplace else and bring it there.

And Jade she really has to grow another head or she is finished-you know what I mean? she is really beautiful but she is still smaller than Bianca. And for a while she would been the tallest girl in her class. She was saying how everybody thinks she is the luckiest girl in the world for having these two great parents but that they just do not know how hard it is. She also said that she could not wait to get married and have a baby who will scream ""Grandma!"" and ""Grandpa!"" at Bianca and Mick. I told her she should marry Steve Rubell and she said ""He would not be faithful"" and Steve said ""Well would you be faithful to me?"" and she said ""I would have to think about it.""

I asked her if she were going to Washington on Wednesday for the Mondales' party for artists whose work is in the vice-president's house and she said she was. I am going down with Fred. I asked her how her big silkscreen was-I heard she would done a big one-and she said ""I do not do silkscreens-I leave that to you."" And so I was confused if she did one or not so then I said ""I mean for your multiples"" and she said ""I do not do multiples."" She was awful. Well she married Motherwell to get a start. Her work's terrible. Went to the movies (cab $3) to see Patti D'Arbanville in Big Wednesday. She had three lines: 1) ""Oh my God"" 2) ""Uh-uh-mm"" 3) ""Eh-oo-oo."""

They said it was okay. Went over there and only Chester Weinberg and David Geffen were up. It was a grey day had some breakfast. Then Calvin and Steve Rubell woke up and they talked about the fun time the night before. Went to a Hawaiian party at Gil de la Cruz's down the street. In the sunlight you can really see what these people look like you really see. Egon Von Furstenberg was the only one I knew. Although I thought I recognized the dog from the Breakstone TV ad the one with the black spot over his eye that Sam Breakstone chases away. Then we went for pizza and you could really see in the light who the dogs were (pizza $20). Then we went back to Calvin's but we walked in on Calvin and Steve who were with those two porno stars Knoll and Ford and so we were embarrassed and left and went back to the party down the street. Then went home again and by this time Chester Weinberg had come back from the party too and he had walked in on two guys who told Chester to go away so Chester was hiding out in his room. Then we had barbecued steak and all the talking was gay gay gay. If I would had a tape recorder you would not believe it. Then what happens is everybody goes to bed about 12:00 and sets their alarms for 2:00 because ""things do not get really hot until 4:00."" I heard everyone getting up at 2:00 but I stayed in bed and later I heard them all coming back from their 4 A.M. cruise."

It was the day of Averil's wedding to Tim Haydock. Suzie Frankfurt was getting us a limo out to Manhasset. Got a call from Christopher on the Cape. Peter wants to stay up there all summer and work on his art and take care of the garden which has not been taken care of since his father died. If he stays up there all summer and makes art and then comes to the city and sells it in the winter he thinks it is a good plan which it is but Christopher can not stand family life and Peter's mother's up there and even though she likes the idea of Chris and Peter being together Christopher just does not like family life. His father's Greek and he lives with a Chinese guy and his mother's in California she is Italian. Went out to Manhasset. Averil looked beautiful. The Kennedy boy who traded ties with me at his brother's wedding was there wearing the tie I would traded him so he was imaginative. He said he was always going to wear it to weddings. I should have worn his. Catherine was there she was a bridesmaid and her hair's lighter so I guess she dyed it. The boys had to pick up the girls and take them to their seats and they were (laughs) about to take me until they realized I was not a girl after all. They played ""America the Beautiful"" and everybody talked and yelled during the ceremony. Averil's whole family was there so tall. And Fred was there in his morning coat. And Vincent and Shelly. And Rachel Ward was a bridesmaid she just finished a movie with Burt Reynolds and now she is off to California to star opposite Steve Martin so she is really made it. Jerry and Mick were there and Jerry's just dying to get married herself you could feel the tension. It was pouring rain and we went in the limo to the reception. it is such a great house. Talked to Catherine she said Winnie wrote her a letter about Tom Sullivan dying that began: ""Somebody who loved you so much is dead."" Which was the exact same note she sent me. I do not know why Winnie's bothering it was like a form letter. And I was telling John Samuels-John Stockwell-that I thought he would have made it as an actor by now and he said ""Listen I am only twenty"" and then I realized he was right! I keep thinking he is like twenty-five. He invited me to his father's house over on West Island in Glen Cove where a lot of people at the wedding were staying for the weekend. it is the ninety-room Morgan house and there is like thirty guests and one servant-Nona Summers was saying how she mentioned she would like breakfast in bed and everybody laughed at her. And John Samuels told me how Michael Kennedy was swinging on the chandelier but then when you go to his house they say ""do not touch that-it will break!"" and they are pointing at some cheap chair. He says that they save all their destruction for when they go visiting that that is why they are always so rowdy wherever they go-because they are so careful around their own things. All the kids were dancing and swimming naked. At 8:30 it was still raining. Then we left to go home and a boy jumped in the car sat in front I do not know who he was. We gave him a ride home."

Nobody was in town so it was an easy cab ride ($4.50). I was doing Flower paintings again and it was so sweltering and I got a funny feeling like a flashback to 1964 because it was the same Flowers and the same heat and the same mood as when I first made them that summer. I asked Rupert how it felt to see me painting these famous sixties images. He said it did not feel like anything. But to me it did. These are a commission. I will do something different with them though-maybe put diamond dust on them. John Reinhold called and invited me to see his apartment that Michael Graves just did. It was raining like crazy. Henry Geldzahler was meeting us for dinner at a place called Petit Robert which sounded familiar but I did not want to think about it. It turned out that it was the restaurant of Robert Biret who I have known since 1948. He gave me work at Glamour and Bonwit Teller and he was my best friend we used to have dinner together in the fifties. I met Halston for the first time at his house. Then Robert left New York and went to Paris. This place is way over on 11th Street. I talked mostly to Robert he looks pretty good. We talked about our mothers. I think his went back to France. There was a lot of garlic in the food. I ate cooked beef with garlic and later I was sorry I could feel it in the morning still.

Tried to read Dominick Dunne's book The Two Mrs. Grenvilles but it is too boring because it is not real and it is not fiction. Then I started reading the copy of Savage Grace that Steve Aronson autographed for me. it is about the Bakelite woman and her beautiful fairy son who killed her and it is all the real society people talking and these fascinating letters from the father-I guess someone will make a good movie out of it because the people are glamorous and it is a good story-mothers who want their sons to be fairies so they sleep with them. Told Stephen to meet me at 7:30 sharp at Diana Vreeland's for dinner. It was a huge rainstorm but it stopped at 7:40 and I walked over. Stephen Sprouse was already there and sweet. he would brought Mrs. Vreeland some outfits. I had my tape recorder on and she came in and said ""what is that?"" and I (laughs) told her ""A camera"" because I thought she could not see. And she said ""No it is not."" So then I told her it would be like old times taping again and she said okay. She said she has a girl sit in the room with her while she sleeps. I thought that was so strange that she would want that. But then I guess she is sick so ... She had four vodkas and she smoked about fifteen cigarettes. Andre Leon Talley was coming the next day to read the Rothschild book to her she said. She can not remember names but then she never could. And the funniest thing was she said that someone who was going through things for her found her birth certificate and it was August 29th and not September 29th the date she would been celebrating all her life because that is when her parents had told her her birthday was. So she is a Leo she finds out."

But I just felt like saying ""Hi I think you are great"" so I did and he unfolded. Sean Penn. I do not know if he knew who I was or not."

Mrs. Winters is trying to get him to move down to Florida and Vincent is scared we will lose him. Looks like the place will not be rented until maybe August if Bianca wants it. People do not like it that all the rocks make swimming difficult and that Montauk is so far away. it is not for sissies.
"Saturday, June 13, 1981",[],-0.09776785714285716,Had a horrible day so depressed. I decided I would explode if I did not get out of the house and I wanted to go to work. I was meeting Rupert at the office but he was not there yet so I went in and pressed the elevator button and the elevator was right there on the first floor and the doors opened and standing in the elevator were two Rastafarians. A man and a woman. It was so strange. So I backed away and went outside and Rupert finally came and then he went in and told them to leave and they just left. I guess they were stoned. They were just standing there like mannequins.

Barbara Colacello picked me up and then we picked up Rupert at the Pierre because it was near a subway stop. Then went over to pick up Blondie. She lives in the great building on 58th and Seventh. Blondie-Debbie-was sweet her hair was fixed up and you would never believe she is in her thirties-no wrinkles and so pretty. She said her grandmother lived to be ninety-five and all her family looks young. She spends all her money on makeup. She must not have been pretty all these years though or I would have noticed her. She must have tried to look bad or something. But I guess some people look better actually when they get a little older. I did not know what to call her. I guess I call her Debbie. But when I introduce her I call her Blondie. But Blondie is the name of the whole group so ... She was really great on the ride out she did not complain about anything and she did not want anything. So we got to Brentano's and the thing was a big dud. The store did not advertise that we would be there until that same day's papers which did not come out until one and so even if people did read it they would not rush down probably. But the kids who came all came just to see Blondie they did not care about me they were a whole new young crowd. What they did was go next door and get copies of her record and had her autograph that. Then Debbie had to get back to rehearse for her new album. We got back around 5:00. After we dropped her Rupert and I went for a late lunch. We had aquavit and caviar ($70). We were getting drunk talking business and we did not pay attention when a guy next to us was down on the floor screaming and finally he said ""Oh can I have your autograph?"" and it turned out to be John Lennon! And I just wished we would noticed him before-he was with Yoko and her mother and it would have been so much fun. John's very skinny now. I do not know what kind of diet he is on maybe rice. They live at the Dakota. Then I went home and I was drunk so a movie was out. I really can not drink in the afternoon."

But it was like Suddenly Last Summer-I was his prop to go cruising the boys would come over to talk to me and Victor would get them. We sat at the Riviera Lounge for four hours having coffees and teas ($7). Went home called Julia Scorsese at the Sherry Netherland-she would called me-and she said to hold on and then she was gone for ten minutes. Then she came back on and said to hold on some more and was gone for another ten minutes. Then Liza Minnelli got on the phone and said ""This is Liza let me have your number and she will call you right back."" And then Julia called and said to come over for dinner. I said I was with Catherine and her brother that evening and she said to bring them. Cabbed to Sherry ($2). As we were going in a guy with a beard was getting into the elevator. Mr. and Mrs. Scorsese Martin's parents were there. they are taller than he is which is unusual because kids are usually taller than their parents. There were a couple of agents. His parents live downtown right below Ballato's. There was a nurse with a beautiful baby. It was a nurse that Julia had just hired and she would gotten lost in the airport so Julia was worried that she was not a good one. There was a Negro girl with a baby too and the guy with the beard turned out to be Bobby De Niro and this Negro girl was his wife Diahnne Abbott. Marty's skinny now he is been on a diet. Jack Haley was running around. Liza was wearing the dress Halston made out of fabric based on my Flower paintings. Marty came out in a white outfit and then changed into a black outfit. Everyone went downstairs to eat. Roger Moore was with them and a girl from you.A. who was doing publicity she was kissing Roger. Roger Moore was wonderful and charming. He showed us what he called his three expressions: ""worried"" ""eyebrow up"" and ""eyebrow down."" he is been married three times he is married to an Italian woman now. Bobby De Niro came in after dinner with an agent with funny glasses did not say much. Marty's parents were there really late. Everybody got really really drunk. They were wanting me to make a toast and I was so drunk I actually stood up and said something and it came out right I guess because everybody kept saying how moving it was but I was so drunk I can not remember what I said. Liza kept saying ""I will tell this to my grandchildren-and I have forgotten everything else!"" It was the best party. I stole a copy of the record album of New York New York because Valentine wanted it and Roger Moore had written backwards on it and then I felt bad because they saw me do it. I was popping painkillers because of the neck operation from last week the biopsy. I have not found out yet. When we left the Sherry it was dawn outside six of the clock (cab $3.50)."

And he kept saying ""Well do not you agree? do not you agree? what is the matter you are not saying anything."" It was really horrible. He said ""she is going to wake up and hate herself. do not you agree? do not you agree?"" And I said ""Well Truman she is so weak now she might commit suicide."" And he said ""Too bad."" He said ""If I told you all the things she is said about you...."" I said I did not care that I never thought of her as a friend that I have always known what kind of a person she is that she was just somebody who was renting our house in Montauk so whatever she said it did not bother me I knew all about it already. It was scary how vicious he could get over someone he was best friends with. When Truman turns he really turns. And Halston's going to rent Montauk we think. Vincent was out there this weekend showing the place to him. Victor was with him and I got scared about that visualizing Victor painting red footprints all over the main house."

Fred really thinks he is English royalty that is what it is become when he drinks. He identifies with them and I do not know why. Chris Stein showed us some 1950 Weegee photos and they were just great. Weegee was the newspaper photographer who would get the first radio call to all the crimes and things and so he would get those kinds of photos. Most of the pictures Chris bought were of a Greenwich Village party and you would think you were looking at pictures of a 1980s party-it looks just the same! it is funny that things really do not change. I mean people think they change but they do not. There were people wearing clothes with safety pins in them and two boys kissing in a window and a woman looking on and then it was called ""Living in Greenwich Village"" and now it is called New Wave or something. But it is the same."

She turned out to be a beautiful girl and she brought her one-year-old baby. The baby gave us a really hard time. Babies are so hard to photograph they never sit still and they are teething or something so they are scrunching up their mouths and they are so cranky and I just hate them. Then Edmund called from Arizona and said that we should do the baby alone but by then it was over-I would only done the baby with the mother and the mother alone. Dropped Rupert ($5). I glued myself and went to meet Alan Wanzenberg and Stephen Webster friends of Jed's. We went to Inagiku. I have been having too much wine lately so I stuck to Perrier and had some raw fish. Alan's an architect working for I.M. Pei. And the other kid's a lawyer and I gave him the job of contesting our tax assessment because the taxes went from $400 to $12000 when they combined both Bowery buildings together which they had no right to do and the place is just a dump so I do not know why it is that high. Then we went for a nightcap at Trader Vic's ($25). The headwaiter invited me to his sculpture exhibition next week. Got home about 1:30.

Picked up PH. Got to the Palladium (cab $5.50). We were at a table with Vera Swift and Philippe Junot and Jacqueline Stone and some prince from Austria and Vera's daughter Kimberly and a man I did not know and two women I did not know. Said hello to Barbara Walters who just announced her engagement a few weeks ago and she looks really good. And everybody was saying how sick Roy looked and that he was dying. Steve Rubell told me the other week that Roy had cancer and was in remission-that it was not AIDS but regular cancer. He did not look well. And Jacqueline Stone was going on worried about her son Oliver who is now in El Salvador directing a movie he wrote and nobody's heard from him in a week. And I remembered later that Boaz Mazor was the star of Oliver Stone's first movie and he once told me that Oliver's mother was a stage mother on the set handing out poppers to the actors to help them act. And then after dinner the politicians' speeches started. Stanley Friedman from the Bronx gave a speech and mentioned Lebanon and the hostages there from flight 847 and said we can not forget the trouble spots in the world like Afghanistan and Nicaragua while we are having our nice dinner at the Palladium. And Philippe Junot during all the political talk just sat there practically asleep. But when somebody at the podium introduced a ""twenty-nine-year-old Donald Trump"" Philippe's head popped up and he said ""Donald's not twenty-nine!"" And then the last speaker was Roy himself and before he started to talk the two big blocks of TV monitors came down and they were all filled with vintage footage of Roy's face from the fifties giving his anti-Communist speeches. And that was exciting it was the best thing. And they brought out a big fat cake and then a Kate Smith record was blasting over the speakers with ""God Bless America"" and the ""flag up there"" that all the speech-givers kept referring to came down and it was actually shredded red white and blue banners. Plastic. Talked to Richard Turley and the lady who invented Weight Watchers. And then the dancing music started and everybody got up. And by this time the kids they would let into the club were overhead looking down from the balcony on the dinner."

We have the company called Nice Jewish Boys moving us and they really all are Jewish boys. One blond one was so cute but he is going back to Israel. They all wanted books so I gave them some of the Philosophy books. I went through one old box from '68 and a picture inside was so strange. We were at a college and we were the only freaks there. It was Viva and twenty of us. Before I was shot. We really were the only freaks there. These kids did not have long hair and yet they did not have normal-looking clean-cut short hair like now either. Today everybody goes down to Astor Place and gets a great haircut but these kids did not even have any fashion. It must have been in a strange place because by '68 practically everybody did have long hair. And they were pudgy. Maybe we were at this Catholic college St. Paul's. Maybe that was it but it was so sad to see-and seeing these pictures of myself! I ran into Bob Colacello on Friday. he is like a dapper rich person now.

But it is so much better with Halston he keeps everything up and does not have a lot of people out and part of the reason he is paying $40000 is because he put furniture in. And Liza does not come out anymore-she and Halston are still not on good terms. Because she did not wear a Halston to the Oscars. And I keep asking people ""Why would she have done that?"" But I think it is the Geros. They wanted to break her up with Halston so they would have more control. I mean when your husband tells you you do not look good in these clothes ... I guess Mark knew that Liza was using Halston's to have assignations too. But Liz Taylor will be coming out to visit Halston in Montauk soon-she is getting Saturdays and Sundays off from Private Lives. Went into the town. And Halston was saying to me ""Oh darling would not it be grand if your paintings cost a dollar and you could just cover houses all over the world with them and a big one for over the fireplace would cost $50-but think of all the homes in America that you could just fill up.""

I was there first then Bob arrived then Lester and Paloma. I was on my diet so I just had melon and arugula but the chicken that Bob and Paloma split looked good. What do restaurants do with the meat that is left like on the backbone? Do they throw it out or do they use it to make hash? Lester interviewed Paloma and she is great she just tells everything. And she said that we could do the end portion of the interview at the MOMA Picasso exhibit with her and she will talk while we walk through. After dinner we went to Un Deux Trois the place on 44th Street that is supposed to be like La Coupole. Then it was too early to go to Bonds. So we went to Les Mouches. And they made Bob pay. Bob still hated Patti LuPone but not quite as much. If she had come over and said ""Oh Bob you are the editor of Interview I love Intervieni"" he would have loved her. I am the same way though I guess. And Ron Duguay was there. At first he was not interested in Patti-these athletes all just like the same blonde types all the time-but I told him ""She really wants you and she is great."" And afterwards she came and sat with him. Patti's funny she does these sophisticated songs and then she gets nervous so she sticks out her tongue like Donald Duck or something.

I told her not to mention my name or he might beat her up that he thinks I am the Devil. She said the apartment is all red and he has everybody's picture up and he puts everybody down. Bill was asking Mick about the ""drug culture"" and the ""revolution"" and all that and then Mick and Jerry left. I stayed there for a little bit. Then Victor Bockris walked me down and we waited for half an hour before a cab came (cab $5). Home at 11:00."

"Saturday, March 12, 1977","[Jack Nicholson, Jane Holzer, Joe Eula, Larry Freeberg, Lee Radziwill]",-0.005390565317035902,"Up early beautiful day. Went down to Subkoff's Antiques to see ideas (cab $3). Walked over to the office. Bob was there looking through pictures for the photo book Bob and I are doing. Vincent went out and got the paper and that is where the headline was: ""MOVIE DIRECTOR CHARGED WITH RAPE."" Roman Polanski. With a thirteen-year-old girl he took to a party at Jack Nicholson's house and when the police went over to Jack's the next day after the girl's parents called them they searched the house and Anjelica got arrested for coke. Victor had told me that I absolutely had to watch the Dinner with Halston show on channel 5 -Metromedia. This is the idea that we submitted to Larry Freeberg at Metromedia and they turned down and now they are doing with other people. Halston's guests were Bianca Joe Eula the acupuncture doctor-Giller Jane Holzer Victor. It was very boring. they would asked me to go on this show and I said no because they would ripped off my idea. It was a live dinner with a seven-second delay. Joe Eula said ""bullshit"" once and it was cut. The only real-life thing missing at the table was coke and no runs to the bathroom. Victor was the life of the dinner he took his fake mustache off. He used to have a real one but he would shaved it off probably because he hates the acupuncture doctor who has one but he put one on for the show. He also had a plastic chicken with him and kept talking to it telling it to ""say hello to Andy."" Joe Eula and Victor had a tiff at the table something about me. Joe told Victor ""Let Andy speak for himself why he is not here"" and that is when Victor-on Metromedia-said that Metromedia had ripped me off. So he was great. Jane did not have the right makeup on so she did not look good and they kept referring to her as ""the renowned fashion model."" The dinner degenerated into throwing drinks. Maybe they would decided on that because they are supposed to be the ""wild set."" Jane threw champagne in the air and then everybody started but it looked so lame and so Victor poured his in her lap. Victor and Halston were having a quarrel-you could tell because Victor announced that he was not going to do Halston's windows anymore that he was now ""an artist for hire"" and the camera went close on Halston's hard face. At one point Halston or Bianca or somebody actually said ""let us take this hour and a half and just go with it!"" And that is when most people probably shut their TVs off the thought of something like that dragging on for an hour and a half must have made them gag. And meanwhile who should Fred be at dinner with but Larry Freeberg who'd stolen the idea from me in the first place. They were all at the Hermitage at a dinner for Nureyev and Freeberg was with Lee Radziwill-they are planning to do a channel 5 dinner with her too. Halston was having a ""cast party"" at his place after the show. When I got there Mick had come by. He was cute-he told Bianca how good she was on the show but around 4:00 he wanted to leave and she did not so she stayed. Everyone was mad at Victor saying he would ruined the show so he would already left to go barring."

Decided we would go to the Met to see what the new Rockefeller Primitive Collection looked like (cab $4 admission $7). Liz Holtzman was going in to see it too and she was nice and charming she came over to say hello. There were a lot of photographs of the Michael Rockefeller boy who got eaten and a boy and a girl were looking at one of them and I heard them say ""He looks like a hippie."" The collection was great it is mostly African but some American Indian and some Mexican and some South American and the installation was terrific. Walked down from 83rd Street to 44th Street and stopped at Barnes and Noble for reference books and some books that'll help with Interview about Dorothy Kilgallen. Bob Bach was a good friend of hers. I just ran into him recently. he is the one who gave me the job as the hand drawing on the weather map for about a week once on CBS during the Will Rogers Jr. show in the fifties."

Fred was there (cab $4). The streets were mobbed with TV crews and police. Churches always make me dizzy. They had pretty flowers on all the pews. The bridesmaids came in and the funny thing with that was that when Bob was in Switzerland they were making up all the bridesmaids' gowns there and they were saying ""These are for the Kennedy wedding they have ordered all these nightgowns."" So here were all these girls in what I knew were nightgowns that cost probably $75 each. Purple with pink ballet shoes. Kerry Kennedy was a bridesmaid and Mary Richardson's sister. And then the bride came in and she was the prettiest bride I have ever seen in my life. Really the best-looking bride. It made you want to get married it really did. I would met her before in Monte Carlo. she is Frank Gifford's daughter. Cab to the St. Regis where the reception was on the roof ($4). It was beautiful up there. I had to shake hands again. Robert Kennedy wanted to trade ties with me and then he was peculiar he wanted to trade pants. he is the other good-looking one he was going with Rebecca Fraser. Really these kids were all so good-looking just a roomful of seventy-five of the best-looking boys and seventy-five of the best-looking girls and then about twenty older people. Caroline Kennedy would not talk to me she was giving me the cold shoulder I do not know why. But John-John was nice he said hi and everything. I went quickly through the receiving line. Senator Kennedy was so sweet to me and thanked me again for doing the posters for him. He and Joan were together at this thing. I was invited to Stephen Graham's and then Franco Rossellini called and invited me to dinner at Le Cirque and we knew that President Reagan was having dinner there too. Walked over there and we got the worst seats we could not see anything so Franco took the best seats and he started describing to us every little thing the presidential party was doing. All of the tables had reporters having dinner to cover the president. The whole place was foreigners Bob and I were about the only Americans. Then we were leaving and did not want to go by the president's table because it was too groupieish-everybody else was stopping at the table-so we went the other way but then they called us over Jerry Zipkin was yelling and I met Mrs. Reagan and she said ""Oh you are so good to my kids."" Then went to go to Stephen Graham's to the Sovereign. A boy asked me to go home with him and I did not know what to do because nobody had ever asked me that. I mean in those words (cab $5). Bed. Then Chris Makos called. I knew he was calling from the Baths and then he admitted it."
"Saturday, March 15, 1980","[Ed Ruscha, Farrah Fawcett, Marion Javits, Prince Abudi, Ryan O'Neal, Sam Green]",0.08262866762866763,"Farrah Fawcett called and said she was on her way down to Union Square and she arrived in half an hour with Ryan O'Neal. They looked at her portrait and I did not think Farrah liked it but then she studied them for about half an hour and finally said she loved it. I had Bob come down because I thought he could talk them into doing a cover and she said she would. And she looked pretty her hair was all washed and she looked very very nice. she is sweet. So then they left and I stayed alone with Rupert. Dropped him off (cab $4). Then glued myself together because I was invited to Prince Abudi's dinner for Marion Javits. His place was just around the corner at 10 East 68th Street and as I am walking in in comes Ultra Violet wearing the same dress from the sixties with the same gold coins and I said ""Gee Ultra you should not do that-it might have been a camp when a gold coin was worth $35 but now they are you know worth $775 apiece so you should be careful."" But she said she is had to sell most of the good ones she was just wearing her pesos very heavy pesos. And it was really fun seeing her again I kept asking her ""Well who invited you how did you get here?"" I think she is a good friend of Marion's. I have a funny feeling that maybe she services people or something I have a funny feeling that maybe that is it-like when there is a guy an older guy maybe she will go out with him or something. But she was fun. I spent the whole evening with her because it was a really awful party. Abudi was very quiet. Although he is a Saudi Arabian prince he did not have any young princesses there so it was just all the people I know like Sam Green and Kenny Lane and Marion's boyfriend who makes holograms. And she likes him. I do not see what she sees in him but he is the mistress. What would you call a guy who a woman sees? A ""lover?"" A gigo -no a lover I guess. And who else was there? Oh the Bulgaris came but I did not get a chance to talk to them because Ultra Violet went to the caviar dish and she said it smelled like a tin and then Kenny Lane came over and said it was the best caviar you could buy so then she decided to eat half a pound of it. And she said she was going to write her memoir. Oh! And she finally told me how she got sick. It was all over Ruscha the artist Ed Ruscha. She had fallen madly in love with him and he had a wife and he just could not handle it and she just went too crazy because she was too in love with him she let her whole nervous system fall apart. And that is when she was eating a piece of gold every day-somebody told her that Indian people eat gold or something like that and it ate a hole in her stomach. And now Ruscha does not have the wife but it is not the same. And she is looking for another young somebody. It ended up we were there until 3:00."

She had two people with her. She said she has a place in New York and goes out and around but I do not know how she can unless she puts another kind of wig on. She talked nonstop for four hours. she is a walking monologue. Jean Michel Basquiat came by and he misunderstood something she said about ""plantations"" so he did not like her but then I got him to come back in and she charmed him. She repeated herself a lot called herself ""trash"" a lot. She said most of her groupies were lesbians and fags. She has a group of dykes that follows her around. She had her hairdresser and her girlfriend Shirley pick her up. They just came in a cab not a limousine. I worked late."

And Mel Bochner the artist who was married to Dorothea Rockburn the artist and got ideas from her. And Mary Boone who said she will give Ronnie a show but he is not interested because she calls him every night at 4:00 in the morning. Carl Andre was there. I invited the Newhouse daughter to lunch on Monday she is just a shy girl but then I found out that her parents were divorced when she was little so I do not know if she is in the bucks or not. Mark Lancaster was there. Bianca had called me before I went to the Newhouses' and invited me over to Halston's later but I could not bring Mark because Halston gets upset when you bring another person. So cab to Halston's ($1.50). Bianca was talking on the phone to Steve Rubell in jail and Steve was having to put in nickels every three minutes. Because you can not call them and you can not write them letters or he does not want you to or something. Somebody asked him if the phone was tapped and he said ""No no."" But then somebody else was saying that when they talked to him before they could hear a guy warning him to watch what he said. Another inmate giving him advice. Steve said he is having a wonderful time that he is put on eleven pounds and he had sloppy rice for dinner. He said that if he can get his liquor license back for Studio 54 then he will liquidate because it will be easier to get rid of it with a liquor license. He said that the top people were there. I think he said Sindona but I am not sure. He said Ian sleeps all the time. Bianca was saying all these things to him like that she was going to Magique later to try it out and that she would been at Xenon the night before. I guess she thinks that kind of talk-that that is the kind of talk that'll excite him. He kept putting nickels in. Bianca had John Samuels there he got a haircut and he looks fifteen."

She had the dark glasses and the big coat and pants on and the mouth and she went into a Trader Horn store to talk to a woman about TVs. Just the kind of thing she would do. So I took pictures of her until I thought she would get mad and then I walked downtown (laughs) I was alone too. Stayed up all night until 5:10 getting ready for the next day to go to California for The Love Boat and now maybe a Coke commercial too.

Then went home and glued myself for Fiorucci's went there at 1:30 and began signing Interviews and I was there all afternoon. Paulette showed up and Keith Richards and Ron Wood and it was the first time I was seeing them in the daylight and they looked so old and beat-up. Their girlfriends looked young and fresh. Paulette was sweet she said she does all her shopping there now. The kids who were waiting on her did not know who she was. it is so strange to be famous in one category and then other people do not know who you are. But I explained to them that she would been married to Charlie Chaplin and they connected with Charlie Chaplin. I was there until 6:00 and then took some of the kids to Reginette ($70).

Michael Bloomfield who did the Bad soundtrack came as we were leaving. Ron Galella was taking pictures. I had to leave to go to the Bad screening. What was so great about seeing the movie at Filmex was that everything had such big significance suddenly because the screen was so big so much more Pop-like that Santa Claus knick-knack on Carroll Baker's refrigerator. I want to rent a big theater for a screening in New York. Got back to the hotel about 3:00."

Halston's fifteen pounds lighter and he was drinking ginger ale. He told me the real story of what happened. He said that he and Martha Graham both shot up B-12 which I knew but that a syringe he would been sent was contaminated with lead and his leg began hurting and he went to the doctor and the doctor said he should rush to the hospital but Halston said no he would just go home but then the other leg started hurting and he could hardly walk and then they rushed him to the hospital they thought he might lose the leg and they operated. I think this is all true because Halston does not make up stories he really does not. He was happy that it did not get in the papers. Then we left there and Steve did not tell Halston but (laughs) he was then going on to Calvin Klein's. Steve dropped me and I went to John Samuels's father's party at 123 East 79th Street. John Samuels Sr.'s boyfriend David played the piano and he said that he practices five hours a day. Mr. Samuels met him when he hired him to be his piano teacher.

Joe would go and live with a fat queen hairdresser just to be perverse. Went to Spago for dinner. Gene Kelly was there with his son and his son said he would see us later at Brad Branson's party (dinner $300). So after dinner we went to Crenshaw Avenue way in the black area of L.A. where Brad Branson who does photographs for Interview was giving his second weekly party. he is doing it like a club but with friends' names on the list.

Fred was with Rupert Everett and Nando Scarfiotti was there and Susan Pile and Paul Jasmin and Toni Basil. And all these kids were coming over to me and it was fun. I was keeping an eye out for someone to fill the new vacancy as my New York Wife. And Mary Woronov was there and I never have anything to say to Mary. I can not ever really forgive her for being such a creep about Chelsea Girls in the sixties for demanding money-saying she would not sign a release until she got it. She squeezed around $1000 out of us. She was talking to that screenwriter named Becky Johnson-she is a friend of Jon's. She and Mary were both in the GQ article on ""The Most Eligible Women in Hollywood."" Whatever that means. The most desperate I guess."

Garrett. Then I had John Scribner talking in one ear about John Samuels IV and in the other ear Cindy the Hustler from Columbus talking about John Samuels IV. And she was jealous because he would dropped her for Larissa. Studio 54 was a lot of fun. I went up in the balcony and Halston was there with Lester and if you say ""This is Lester Persky the producer of Hair"" these boys just get down on their knees.

She offered us a ride back to the hotel. She was cute wearing leather and foxtails. And then we invited lots of models to a party Lord Jermyn was giving for me-he said it was a party for me but I think it was just a good excuse. That was at 9:00. We picked up Chris and walked over. Johnny Pigozzi told me that John Belushi died from an overdose. Then the models said they had another party to take us to and Eric de Rothschild said he wanted to come with us and that he had ""a limo"" outside but it turned out he just had a Volkswagen and so about eight of us had to fit into it. And we got to the party and it was really great all these beautiful models one better than the other. Dancing to beautiful tunes American smoking joints and cooking frankfurters with the windows open. Then the police came and we got scared everybody had to throw their dope away.

Fireplaces working all the time. His cousin a girl came from New York to make a cake for us and she baked bread too which was the best thing. New Hope is 90 percent gay. We went to a place called Ramona's and a drag queen served us and people were there drinking at 2 P.M. Gay old guys. It was too gay for me it drove me crazy. Like a time warp. A gay hotel-motel. The drag queen looked like Rupert's mother with the blonde beehive. She had on pants but a four-inch leather belt really tightening in her waist. And a guy came over and said Rupert was an alien and Rupert said ""I am not an alien. I am Rupert Jason Smith"" (lunch $60). And then Rupert said I had to leave the drag queen a big tip since she stayed open for us (tip $25). Gave me goosebumps. Then we went to places run by gay sons and fat mothers. Antiques places. Then we went back to the house and the girl had made a dessert and we ate lots of bread. Then at 7:30 we left for New York and then after John dropped me off I remembered that I would been invited to Chastity Bono's birthday party. So I cabbed downtown to Sixth Avenue between 9th and 10th a Mexican restaurant ($6). The party was in full swing. Every girl was like a movie star I mean she would copied a look.

She started saying things to me like ""Do you believe in children?"" and ""You can always adopt"" and ""You should get married."" And then she said ""Maybe this is too personal for you we can go into it another time."" So now I am thinking that maybe Tama has put ideas about me into Paige's head because it was odd when Paige got so upset that I did not call her from Europe. But then I thought maybe Tama's doing this for herself. I do not know it is too odd. what is wrong with them? can not they see they are barking at the wrong tree? Someone should set them straight."

So we left there and when I called later on after thinking about it they said it cost $16000. I mean these are kids right off the street getting these prices! Went to the office and John O'Connor came to help. Did two big Rorschachs and they looked kind of good I do not know.

Peter and I went into another room to talk and while we were doing that we heard all this commotion in the back room and when we went in there was a big water-pistol fight. Nobody wanted to give up until finally Christopher did give up because he was cornered in the bathroom. Shelly and Jon were winning and they were sneaks. Then Christopher went up to Jon and slapped him right in the face and it was so dramatic we just could not believe it and he just stood there taking it but he said it did not hurt that he thought it was all in fun. And he told me that he has to win at everything that he has to decide what is right and what is not right and that if he wants it he gets it and if he does not want it he does not care but he has to decide he wants it and that is all he wants.

And this woman was holding these two big white dogs and I do not know if she belonged there or if she did not. You do not know about people. Everybody just does their own stuff on their own scale. There was a naked baby in the middle of the floor.

He calls at like 7 A.M. because he has not gone to bed yet. He wanted to go to the Jackie Curtis wedding so I got myself together. Cabbed to St. Mark's Church on Second Avenue ($9). But the wedding was called off there because the priest was upset because Jackie had called the newspapers and done press so he would not do the wedding and so it was moved to Mickey Ruskin's place at One University so we went over there. Jackie's relatives would come over and say things like ""I am Jackie's aunt from Toledo."" And then Jackie arrived so late as usual and it is the strangest thing she is still telling everybody that we were roommates twelve years ago. I am beginning to think maybe she really does believe that. Remember when he used to tell interviewers that we were roommates and it was a big joke? Well now I wonder did he believe it then or did he start to believe it later or did he just have a hallucination for a minute and it stuck? Anyway for some reason he now really does believe it. There were a couple of people there who looked like Valerie Solanis who came over and said hello. Jackie was wearing a beaded cut-short dress and his teeth were so bad-looking. The groom was a good-looking Czechoslovakian boy maybe twenty-one or twenty-two and maybe mentally retarded I do not know. He did not open his mouth. So then we left there and went to the Village and it was the Art Fair time and so many people stopped me for autographs."

When Bianca arrived she passed out some Locker Room poppers and Barbara Allen did not want Philip Niarchos to take any so she hid them and later when Bianca ran out of them she begged Barbara for them back. Meanwhile some creepy girl recognized me-we were dining al fresco because it was a beautiful night clear sky and big moon-and she started screaming in French that she loved me but that I abandoned the underground and that she was a necrophiliac just released from a mental institution. It sort of ruined dinner. Fred was tired and went home. We dropped Philip and Barbara at the Ritz Bianca had a car. In the car after we dropped them Bianca said she did not know what to do because Barbara had asked her if she knew if Philip slept with any other girls when he was down in the south of France last week. Bianca told us he would been with Anouk Aimee's daughter Manuela Papatakis and Bianca did not know whether to tell Barbara the truth and hurt her or lie and have her find out from someone else and then think that Bianca was not her real friend. Barbara had refused to go to the south of France with him because she had a ""screen test"" with Jack Nicholson."
"Saturday, May 3, 1986",[Barbara Allen],0.07942328042328041,Stopped at Sotheby's. Looked at my paintings. Somebody put one of my Ticket to Studio 54 paintings up for auction and somebody's going to make $5 or $7000 that is the estimate on it ... I wonder who is selling it. I gave them to Halston and Barbara Allen people like that. Paige picked me up and we went to Kenny's opening but first we went to the Pop Shop Keith's store that opened the other week that I still had not been to. And he has five people working there two bosses and three kids. And they get paid $8 an hour. But the store is hard to find it is that little bit out of the way that makes a big difference. I do not know if people will go but there were people in it. Bought watches. Went to Kenny's. It was a good party. They had three cooks there making pasta under the right kind of light and it looked so chic. Kenny was unusually high.
"Saturday, May 30, 1981",[],-0.015151515151515148,I had a long philosophy talk with Brigid and we both decided that maybe time had passed us by. When I saw myself in those home movies we took on the Cape last weekend I hated myself so much. Every simple thing I do looks strange. I have such a strange walk and a strange look. If I could only have been a peculiar comic in the movies I would have looked like a puppet. But it is too late. what is wrong with me? I look at Vincent and Shelly and they look normal. And I do not look good in cowboy boots anymore I do not think. I think I will get sneakers. I will have Jay take me over to Paragon to get some.
"Saturday, May 31, 1980",[Dick Powell],0.14166666666666666,I was working at home. I watched a good old movie about skating with Dick Powell. It was not really about skating but it had everybody skating. It was so cute it looked just like the Roxy. Skating was so big in the early forties I guess but then it died out in the fifties-no in the sixties I guess. Everything died out in the sixties.

He came and rolled some joints. He was really nervous I could tell about his show opening later on at Mary Boone's. Then he wanted a new outfit and we went to this store where he always buys his clothes. He had b.o. We were walking and got to Washington Square Park where I first met him when he was signing his name as ""Samo"" and writing graffiti and painting T-shirts. That area brought back bad memories for him. Later on his show was great though it really was."

But I said ""You must have known or you would not have hid them away for all these years and you must have bought them cheap off somebody like Terry Ork or Soren Agenoux."" So those fakes really did damage and Gerard is still swearing up and down he did not do them. They made my prices go down because people are now afraid to buy paintings because they feel they could be buying fakes. there is an auction coming up of paintings that Peter Brant is selling-a big Electric Chair a big Soup Can a big Disaster a big Mao and a small Soup Can."
"Saturday, May 7, 1983",[John Reinhold],-0.061972402597402595,Benjamin picked me up and then picked up John Reinhold and we went to 78th and Madison to that expensive Italian place Sant Ambroeus. And because they are so expensive they do everything slllowwwly. They wrap everything chicly ten times and you pay for their chic slowness. And oh my sister-in-law is in town and she calls and says she is going to come over some evening but I keep saying I am out of town. Her son James does not call anymore-he is been in New York for about two years. He got a place right across the 59th Street Bridge in Long Island City. So he is sticking it out. He does art freelance he draws sort of Conan the Barbarian-looking things.

And he did not even laugh he had no sense of humor he did not know I was kidding he got upset. And he made a point of telling me that he just spent $20000 stopping the condos so now I am expecting a bill from him. I told him Lauren Hutton was building a house and he told me Paul Simon was too. Went to see Rear Window and I was next to a black guy who would not move but when he saw it was me he said ""Us Leos do what we want to do right?"" He had b.o. He was intellectual he laughed in the right places. I loved the movie it was beautiful Technicolor like they do not make anymore."

His boyfriend is black and so he had 400 black kids there so cute so adorable. Just like the sixties except (laughs) black. And Ronnie was there looking very chic with his girlfriend. His art's selling like crazy. Then there was a party for the show in the basement where it was all in blue light and they wanted me to go down but I knew my hair would turn completely blue so I did not go.

Herman drove really fast in this pouring rain. After we got there we were not allowed to say one word to each other. We went into the lunchroom and then the monk read something for twenty minutes while we ate our lunch-sour apple cider and lentil soup which tasted like canned to me but when I said so everyone just looked at me like I am crazy but-I think I know my soup. There was one really good-looking priest and he was behind me. Then we left and went to Paris.
"Saturday, November 15, 1986",[Michael Jackson],-0.00026455026455026495,Went to Saks and there was a big crowd for the Swatch event. Keith and I did our autographing act together. Stuart picked me up and Michael Jackson was staying across the street at the Helmsley Palace and we went to a gallery near there to look at Bouguereaus. Stuart's going to try to see him this time. The last time he blew it. Michael Jackson was coming to his apartment at 3:30 but Stuart got home after 3:30 so he missed him. But now Michael is in town again and he is wearing a brown wig and dark glasses and a white gas mask so if you see that coming down the street ...

Madonna arrived with a black wig on. Downstairs there were three limos and we went out to see the ""Greener Pastures"" thing at BAM in Brooklyn. Keith had done the sets and Willi Smith did the clothes. I was next to Stephen Sprouse and he is so hard to talk to but I am just crazy about him he is adorable. And we were all wearing Stephen Sprouse. It was really a great show. And they had really good hair in the show. Like brown underneath and red on top and they used twine. I talked to Stephen about doing show-biz stuff. Then that was over. We went to Mr. Chow's for dinner. Then we went to Area and saw Keith make dresses on John Sex. I asked Madonna if she would be interested in doing a movie and she was smart she said that she wanted more specifics that she just did not want to talk and have her ideas taken. she is very sharp. she is really hot right now. Stayed till 3:00 too many people coming up to me to talk (cab $8)."

Thomas Ammann picked me up in his limo and we went to the Odeon and it was star-studded with artists-John Chamberlain and Joseph Kosuth and the Christos and a lot of art dealers and Barbara Jakobson. And a creepy girl who said she is been trying to come in to the office to see me but Robyn will not let her in. She wants me to look at her work so badly that I am going to have to or she will go crazy (dinner $256.80).

Cabbed into town ($20). We made it to the office by 1:00. Finally T.T. Wachtmeister said I could bring Jon to the dinner for the king of Sweden at Reginette's. So then I called him and he was not sure if he wanted to go. I was getting nervous and drinking coffee-I had an opening at 4:00 a retrospective of prints down at the Castelli Gallery. Leo called and asked when I was coming down he wanted to show me a photograph of me by Hans Namuth which did turn out to be beautiful. I hated the show. And Ethel Scull said ""Do you remember me?"" (laughs) And Lester Persky invited me to his cocktail party before the king of Sweden party but I could not go because the only way I could get Jon to come to the king of Sweden dinner was by first taking him to Giorgio Sant'Angelo's surprise party for Marina Schiano. Oh and I am forgetting the most glamorous thing of my opening. Warren Beatty walked in with Diane Keaton and I made a faux pas by saying ""I just read that article about you in Playgirl"" and they said ""Oh my God!"" and ran out. I do not know if they were interested in buying art or if Diane Keaton wanted to take pictures but anyway they made quite an effort to come to this crowded thing so that was nice. So later at Reginette's I really liked dinner it was fun. The cute girl next to Jon was an Argentinian a Ford model and she was cute because she ate the bread that I would autographed. And (laughs) the king of Sweden was there. Bob said that a few months ago Diana Ross's P.R. guy would not say if she would come or not to this dinner that he (laughs) asked Bob ""Well who else is going to be there besides you Andy and the king of Sweden?"" I got home and went to bed and the alarm went off at 3:30 and I was scared and Aurora was there and we went around the house together holding hands and it was a false alarm we did not find the bogeyman."

So I had it spread out on the floor and then suddenly they arrived and Prince Michael walked right on it he thought it was a floor covering. So Fred asked him to autograph it. And he just signed it ""Michael"" he does not use ""Prince."""

They put it on because it was the JFK death anniversary I guess. I am always surprised that one of the Kennedy kids would not want to know what really happened who really killed JFK and Bobby Kennedy. you would think Caroline would get interested and say ""I do not care if I get killed I want to know."" Went to Doyle's and then to Sotheby's and got catalogues (cabs $4 $5). This is right before they closed. And they told me there that I would just done very well. The Soup number two went pretty high at $6600. I forgot we would sent Jay to bid on Ladies and Gentlemen a set of those and some Flowers. Jasper's Numbers set went for $140000. There was a dinner at 7:30 at River House and Paige said she would pick me up. She arrived and had a basket on her head with flowers on it. It was left over from the photo session for Tama's book A Cannibal in Manhattan that they would done that afternoon at Tavern on the Green. Paige is art-directing the book setting up the photos in it. Stuart had told me how beautiful the ""hat"" looked but it was just-ridiculous. she would had on a silver outfit but for the dinner she changed into a black Gaultier but kept the hat on. The dinner was for Francesco Clemente it was given by the Angela Westwater lady who has the Sperone Westwater Gallery and the first person whose hand I shake turns out to be Alan Wanzenberg-I did not recognize him right away. And then I realized Jed was right across from me. Then Edit deAk came over and told Paige and me ""Oh the two of you should be married."" A Tama-type line. I made a faux pas I said to Alba Clemente ""Is Bianca coming?"" I forgot that Bianca had had an affair with Clemente. She said ""No. she is not a friend of mine."" And Thomas Ammann said Mary Boone wants to represent me and that I should think about it. Keith and his friend Juan were there. And then about thirty-five people were going down to Nell's. I did not want to go and Paige did so I told her to go ahead but she insisted on dropping me off-I can just feel all the weird problems starting again. When we got to my house Paige's flowers had fallen out so she was going home with an empty basket on her head."

He took his drinks onto the wagon with him and he was riding around drinking. Jamie took me to his aunt's house to see a 5' dollhouse. It was like an old-fashioned Christmas. Then went over to the museum where an antique dealer was having a benefit for an opera school and I really enjoyed that they were singing an opera. They passed a hat around and Frolic gave Catherine $20 of his own money for her to drop in and I dropped in $20 too. did not get to bed until around 4:00.
"Saturday, November 27, 1982",[],0.012499999999999999,Brigid called and I invited her to see Cars (tickets $200). Cabbed to the theater ($6). We had first-row seats but on the side. The first act was so boring but I noticed the pussies of the girls in the cat suits. I was so revolted. You could see the slits up their fronts. They should really wear pads. And you could see the hair coming from their pussies but then they also had cat fur put on there so it was confusing. But oh you could just see everything! Maybe that is why all these old men are going to the show. And I finally saw what the set was a big Pop Art thing it was like two-feet-high Coke bottles and two-feet-high Campbell's Soup Cans whatever you would find in a kitchen. But Oldenburg size. And people were gesturing me to look at it. And a lady near us put her husband's coat and hat on a box in front of them and it turned out to be a Brillo box that was part of the set and his hat got squashed when a cat sat on it. Oh but those pussies. You could see the- cracks-and the lips-of the-the-the-vulva. Okay? that is how outlined it was.
"Saturday, November 28, 1981","[Ethel Scull, Nikki Haskell]",0.025757575757575757,Worked all afternoon. The Du Pont twins called and invited me to Cornelia Guest's eighteenth birthday party that Nikki Haskell was giving for her at Le Club. I said that I had a date with Peter and Christopher and they said to bring them. Then they talked me into going to the Underground the disco on the first floor of 860 which I never wanted to do. I went with Cornelia because she wanted to be photographed with me and Peter and Chris went separately. We got there and I met the Mafia-looking guys and they were so scary. Ethel Scull was there and she could not believe I was dancing and making a fool of myself and so she invited me to her birthday party the next night so I could make a fool of myself there too and I said yes but I knew I would not go. The people who run the place brought out the Dom Perignon for us. And Cornelia's friends were so cute so many cute girls in jewelry all eighteen. A juggler was juggling for Cornelia and he gave me one of his juggles. The Underground was doing very well when Studio 54 was closed but now Studio's open again....

And the guy was handsome and lunch was fun. I think I will try (laughs) to get a car and driver out of them to get the ""feel"" for the paintings. I am painting old Mercedeses for them. Then Katy Ford and her husband Andre Balazs took me to the Miss Olympia contest at the Felt Forum and afterwards we went to Tommy Tang's down on Duane Street. It was fun. Richard Johnson of Page Six was with us and he said that when he was working at the newsroom of the Post he got a phone call and it was Timothy Hutton saying ""Hello this is Timothy Hutton. Did anyone there call me?"" And Richard asked around and everybody said no. And then Timothy Hutton asked ""Well did anyone call Madonna?"" I guess she was with him. You know how these things are you get a message with a number. And they said no. And so then he said ""Well where is it that I am calling?"" And they said ""The New York Post. And since we have got you on the phone what are you doing with Madonna?"" And he hung up fast."

I was going to call Dr. Karen but I could not face being tortured with collagen needles. I did not even call to wish her a Happy Thanksgiving. So I am at the office and the phone rings and it is Geri Miller calling from the women's shelter and she goes back and forth from ""You scumbag!"" to being sweet. And she is screaming in the background calling some policeman ""You nigger!"" and I could hear him getting mad and then later she is screaming at this social worker ""You black lesbian nigger get away from me!"" And she is saying that Mario Cuomo is her father-the other day she called and said Muhammad Ali was-and then she knows everything-like she knew the cover I did of Cuomo for Manhattan inc. magazine. And she is saying ""He has a birthmark there and I have a birthmark there so he is my father!"" it is like talking to Crazy Matty. And they both have all this energy. She said ""When you saw me on the street I was working in real estate for Alice Mason."" that is exactly what she said. And I have a funny feeling she is a young senile person. After seeing these Donahue shows. Because she says they say it is schizophrenia but I do not think so. A Jewish girl who came from New Jersey-in her Trash days she was our most sensible superstar-then in the seventies she suddenly got crazy. One day she was very down to earth worrying about her topless dancing career and then the next week she showed up barefoot at 860 saying that the Mafia gave her LSD because she knew too much! From working in all those topless bars they own on 45th Street I guess. And so she is calling from shelters and the odd thing is she remembers all these details of things that happened to her way in the past. Like she brought up when she had sex with Eric de Rothschild in the sixties and she said that after they had sex he called up Jane Holzer to go for a walk in the park and she said ""Why did he have to call up Jane Holzer-why did not he take me for a walk?"" I mean every detail. Does that mean nothing's happened in her life since then? Oh and more sixties updates: My sixty-year-old cousin called and she was in town with her son and said they wanted to come and see the office so they came down. And her son is the one who knew Ondine in Pittsburgh. He once took the film courses that Ondine was (laughs) giving there and he told me that Ondine is now selling hot dogs at Madison Square Garden. I am serious. You know Ondine ""rented"" all those films from us and then never returned them. Loves of Ondine Chelsea Girls. And there was a story about Gerard Malanga in New York about him being the new archivist for the Parks Department and for some reason Vincent was upset that Gerard was saying he was thirty-eight. I took a picture of Gerard the other week though and he does look great. But how old is he really? About forty-two or forty-three? And oh God on my Blue Cross I just scribble and make it up all the time and then I get these things that say my birthday is August 28 1982 so if I have an accident I probably will not get (laughs) my money. I am starting to think that crystals do not work. Because look what is happened lately when they are supposed to be protecting me-my rug has cancer from the moths I stepped on a beautiful old plastic ring and crushed it and I was assaulted at the book signing. But I have got to believe in something so I will continue with the crystals. Because things could always be worse."

I mean they went through so much to get a good actress for Gone with the Wind and then now they are having Marisa play her?

We went around to all the wonderful shops and there was so much Deco around you just could not believe it. Later Jerry Hall called and said she wanted us to come to see her and Mick's new apartment on that island in the middle of the Seine. Mick was in the recording studio. She asked me to bring two bottles of champagne so I bought some ($200) and we went over there. I talked to Thomas and I really made him tell what he knew about the Jed situation and he finally did. Thomas Ammann is the person who brought Alan Wanzenberg into the picture Thomas knew him first. Then Fred wanted to go dancing and I just wanted to go home so Thomas dropped me. And I came home and waited around for the phone to ring and it did not and I was depressed and I put my earphones in with La Boheme.

Closed up and went to Seventh Avenue and 4th Street (cab $5 tickets $30) and after the play we went ""backstage"" which turned out to be (laughs) outside. I got Demi Moore to invite me out to her wedding on December 13th to Emilio Estevez so that'll be a good time to go out it is the big art time there. Elizabeth Saltzman had invited me for dinner at Indochine. She was inviting Barry Tubbs and I was the draw. she is with Jellybean now though. Cabbed to Indochine ($6). Barry Tubbs never came. Elizabeth did not pay which was odd because she would invited us (dinner $200). Somebody came in and told us the whole story of the night before at Nell's how Fred had stood on a table and pulled down his pants in front of the whole restaurant. Then we went down to Nell's and there were eight of us (admission $40) and they got us the table in the back.

The Carter son who is not married was supposed to be coming that is why the limo but he did not come. In about forty-five minutes we were out in Jersey at the stadium club. We got the VIP treatment up to have brunch and bloody marys. Robert Redford and Muhammad Ali were there. Also Gordon Lightfoot and Albert Grossman who used to manage Dylan. He told me again that he has my silver Elvis but I do not understand that because I gave it to Dylan so how would Grossman get it? Kissinger was there waving his hands around like the pope. There were lots of Secret Service around. Then at 1:30 they made them go out to the game. I went over to Muhammad Ali and said hi but he looked at me blankly he did not seem to know who I was or remember that he met me down at his training camp in Pennsylvania. His people who tell him who is who and what is what were not around and he was just alone eating so I got embarrassed and backed away. In the stands I sat next to Robert Redford's two kids about twelve and thirteen. Everybody said this was the first time Redford was out in public letting himself be photographed. There were empty seats all around me where the Carter kid was supposed to be but he never showed. Muhammad Ali was in front of me and they would put the Carter kid next to him. Ali's wife and kid were there too. Elaine of Elaine's was there too she told me she was on a high-protein diet. But later I saw her stuffing herself with rolls. Pele played on one side and then on the other side. When it started to rain they passed out raincoats to the VIPs and it was nice in the rain it made it more exciting. Seventy-five thousand people there. The parks commissioner invited Ali into his glass box so he would not get wet. When we were getting really soaked we jumped into somebody's box and the little girl in it said her father owned the Giants. Kissinger shook my hand but he shook everybody's. The men from Ali's Pennsylvania camp recognized me and asked if I would talked to Ali and I lied and said no.
"Saturday, October 1, 1983","[Brooke Shields, Matt Dillon]",0.028125,"Had to get up early. Maura and I were scheduled to interview Matt Dillon at Fred's house. Finally Matt came and sat in the kitchen and Maura interviewed him. he is only nineteen. Maura asked the same things she always asks: ""Are you Catholic?"" and ""Are you Irish?"" He said yes. it is going to be the same exact interview as Brooke Shields."
"Saturday, October 10, 1981","[Maxwell Caulfield, Steve Rubell]",0.2776199494949495,"I wanted to see Duran Duran at the Savoy because their videotape was so good it is called ""Girls on Film."" When I got there the first band was still on. Duran Duran are good-looking kids like Maxwell Caulfield. And then afterwards they wanted to meet me so we went backstage and I told them how great they were. They all wore lots of makeup but they had their girlfriends with them from England pretty girls so I guess they are all straight but it was hard to believe. We went to Studio 54 in their white limo and Steve Rubell was really nice to them. He took them to the booth and gave them drinks. Ran into old friends met a bunch of new kids and got home at 5:00 (cab $5)."

Jay's back with Kate Harrington and he is too happily married to go to work too. Benjamin's too happily married to go to work. So I went alone ($6). The only person who was called was Michael Walsh the kid from Newport who wants me to look at his work. Worked till 8:00 all alone. Went uptown ($6). Cabbed to Mick and Jerry's for dinner on West 81st Street (cab $4). There were three butch bodyguards outside. Jack Nicholson was there and he is into Bouguereau now-he has all these Remingtons and now he is buying Bouguereaus. The baby was not there. Jerry's sister Rosy was and she had her two tits almost popping out which is so odd because I do not know why she would dress like that when she has this big butch sexy great husband. And I talked to Wendy Stark and she had three pictures of her kid so it looked like triplets. Whoopi Goldberg came and the Garfunkel guy was there and Mike Nichols. Tina Chow was in the kitchen with the food they would done it. And I approached Jack Nicholson about being in the Jackson Pollock story that PH and I are now thinking of buying the book rights to from Ruth Kligman and then Fred came up and said it was a terrible idea that Ruth Kligman was another Crazy Matty and so Jack said ""Well I will let you two movie moguls fight it out."" Jack was wearing a suit that he would had made in London that made him look like a box. Mick was drunk and really friendly came over and hugged me a few times. I was sort of glad that I did not bring Cornelia because she would be ""a threat"" to Jerry. I was surprised to see Whitney Tower there because Jerry always accused him of getting girls for Mick. There was a whole other room with more stars in it."
"Saturday, October 15, 1977","[Bobby Zarem, Chris Makos, John Weitz, Susan Kohner]",0.06722222222222221,Ran into John Weitz the fashion designer on Madison with his wife Susan Kohner the actress who gave up acting to be married to him. He was going over to Fraser-Morris so I went with them. They wanted to invite me to a party they said and asked for my number. They wanted the home number I guess and I gave them the number down at the office and I do not think she liked that. Went to Studio 54 and it was jammed. Victor and Halston were there together. It was a party (laughs) to show that Victor was not blackmailing Halston. Victor said that Bobby Zarem had called and said there was a rumor that one of Halston's employees was blackmailing him so they should appear together to squelch the rumor and have lots of pictures taken. Then later Chris Makos took us to a bar on 52nd called Cowboys a hustler bar where Ara and Zoli go to pick up beautiful kids for models. Left about 4:30 got newspapers and magazines ($5).
"Saturday, October 18, 1986",[Stephen Sprouse],0.04182655478951775,Stuart called and said that he was interested in a platinum flute at Christie's that was going at auction and he was trying to get me interested in the gold one. I met him and Sam there and looked at it and it would have made a good necklace. Stuart decided he would not go above $120000 for the platinum one. The silver one went for $4400 and then I started bidding on the gold one but my last bid was $22000 and it went for $40000. The platinum flute was estimated at $40000 but the bidding kept going up and up. Stuart kept his paddle up and I could feel his whole body next to me shaking as if he was having an orgasm. He was in a panic to see who the other person was who was bidding but we looked around and could not figure out where the other bids were coming from but when the bidding was over it was Stuart's flute for $170000 which with the tax and commission is about $200000. Stuart was in shock. Just in shock. Everybody there thought it was me who'd bought it not Stuart. People ran over and started giving me their cards and handing me copies of Flutist magazine. It was really funny. Then reporters came and asked why I wanted it and to some of them I said because it had the World's Fair emblem on it so I needed it for my collection of World's Fair plastic knives and forks and to some others I said I was buying it to melt down. Stuart could not even open his mouth to tell them it was his flute he was still shaking so I dragged him out of there. The other guy bidding turned out to be from New Hampshire and he looked rich. I told Stuart to invite him to one of his musical soirees and try to sell him something. The flute had a whole story some man willed it to his mistress but then after he died his family could not believe he would have a mistress so they held it up for ten years. it is American. Boston. Kincaid. Then Stuart wanted two double martinis and four hot chocolates so we went and got them. Then we went to the Antiques Center to see if we could find another flute for $2. Stuart's trying to think of how to pay for this. Then he went home and I cabbed ($6) downtown. I would made plans to see Sid and Nancy with Stephen Sprouse. It was at the 57th Street Playhouse (tickets $18 popcorn $5). Ann Lambton played herself the movie was sick real-nobody would ever want to be a punk after they saw it.
"Saturday, October 19, 1985","[Alice Neel, Bill Katz, Jean Michel Basquiat, Tony Shafrazi]",0.18613608613608612,I got a cab downtown ($5.50) to meet Vincent who had opened up and his mother who is in town for a visit for two weeks from California and then after she leaves his father's coming. And you can not believe how energetic she is. She says she is my age but she looks like she could be Vincent's sister. And she does beautiful paintings really tight good stuff. She wants to be the new Alice Neel. I guess she saw her on some TV show. Ran into that artist Bill Katz who raved about the show of Jean Michel Basquiat and me at Tony Shafrazi's. It was coming down this weekend. Jean Michel Basquiat was getting all the good press not me. And Tony's not too happy I guess he did not sell many. They were expensive-$40000 or $50000. It was too early I think. I am hanging on to my Piss paintings.

Sean McKeon the Wilhelmina model called from Japan. It was Sunday there. Bob was working on the Ten Straight Men For Sao dinner that he would promised her still trying to find some straight guys. Every straight man cancelled. I guess they will not come out with us without Richard Weisman and the athletes. Dropped Rupert (cab $6.50). Bob was ringing the doorbell he had a limo with Sao. We went to Helene Rochas and Kim D'Estainville's at the Olympic Tower for a drink. It was windy. Sao had just had her hair done and she said that she would never live there because when you walk in the door the draft is so strong that your hairstyle always goes. She said she knew a couple of women who have moved out because of that. So before she went in we had to go in and have the guy close the inner door and that got rid of the wind and then she came in. Then we went to dinner at 65 Irving. We picked up Franco Rossellini on the corner in our limo. We yelled ""Mary!"" and he did not hear us and then ""Porno Queen!"" and he still did not hear us and he was wearing a cape and finally he saw us. he would told Bob earlier in the day that he was retiring from the movie business because he would made so much money on Caligula."
"Saturday, October 26, 1985",[Keith Haring],0.125,Keith Haring was having an opening so cabbed to the gallery (cab $4). Keith said that when they had walked into the gallery earlier he was with his mother and Joey Dietrich - I guess it must have been around noon-and two white kids threw tar and feathers at them and the only one who got hit was Joey. And we were trying to figure out what that meant-tar and feathers. When do you do that and what kind of person would do that? What was the message? Oh and the tabloids say that there is a big TV producer who is got AIDS and who could it be? I am telling you I do not want to know anybody ever in my life. it is so much better just going to dinner. there is different ways to have fun different kinds of people to have fun with. I do not need romance.
"Saturday, October 27, 1984","[Jack O'Shea, Truman Capote]",0.05909090909090909,Kate's picture was big in part one of the Truman Capote article in New York magazine and part two is about to come out so I am wondering if it is going to say how she is actually the daughter of the old boyfriend Jack O'Shea.
"Saturday, October 28, 1978","[Aline Franzen, Bill Cecil, John Warner, Lee Grant, Liz Taylor Warner, Thomas Ammann, Truman Capote]",0.027188805346700085,"Thomas Ammann called. he is staying at Fred's house. We went to Christie's and got catalogues because some of my old drawings are up for sale. they are from Bill Cecil who was killed in a car crash. His family was in the American antiques business. I think that is how I started collecting American stuff-I got my first cupboard from them the cupboard that is now in the Interview office the one they keep the pencils and rubber cement in (catalogues $6 $22 $8 $10). Victor said that Halston had been trying to reach me to invite me to the benefit for John Warner that Liz Taylor Warner was having that night. Liz looked very fat but very beautiful. Chen her secretary was there. But John Warner was not even there. Liz was upset at how awful the party was. Halston told her he would have just given her the $10000 if that is all she was getting from it. Some face doctor that said I would met him in California three years ago started talking to me he said he was screwing all day and had come seven times. I do not know why he was telling me. He asked me how old I was and I said ""Thirty-five"" and he said I looked forty-five. He said (laughs) that if I go to him I can look like ""a normal thirty-five-year-old"" because he would do nutrition and things. I guess that is why he was telling me he was screwing that I could come seven times if I went to him too. Then Aline Franzen who was in charge of the party decided to do her auction thing but nobody at this thing was about to buy anything-they were all just wearing the teentsyest jewel you could buy at Bulgari or something. Aline said ""This is my painting that I did myself with my whole heart and who will bid on it?"" And nobody did. Finally Liz hit me and said ""You better bid on it"" and I said no that I wanted to bid on the two tickets to Studio 54 and finally Liz screamed ""All right I will take it myself"" and Aline said ""No Liz you can not"" and Aline threw herself on the floor and was crying and it was such a comedy and then Liz's secretary Chen said she would take it and Liz screamed ""No Chen you can not you do not have any money."" And Lee Grant was an auctioneer too she auctioned off two teeth porcelain ones I think for $2. I am telling you nobody in this crowd was going to buy a thing. Oh poor Liz. And Aline said ""You rich people are being cheap."" And then John Cabot Lodge got up and made a peculiar speech because he talked about the Red Enemy and it was so weird. Then Halston and Liz said they would meet afterwards at his house. So Halston and I went to his house together. Liz sneaked in later and he gave her some coke and she got high and happy. I told her ""Look you have got nine days until the election you have got to really get down and talk to the Negroes."" I said ""This lady stuff is not going to work."" And she said ""Oh lawdy lawdy lawdy."" And I told her ""Listen if you lose the election and you leave your husband I want you to play Truman Capote for me on Broadway."" So she started laughing and went into a trance and tried to talk like Truman but she could not remember how he talked. Then Victor and I went into the kitchen and I fed Linda potato chips under the table which I was not supposed to do which was fun and Halston and Liz were talking intimately in the other room and he told me later that John Warner was not fucking her. I told her ""Elizabeth""-you really do have to call her Elizabeth-I said ""Elizabeth it would be so great to see you in the White House."" And she was cute she said ""Oh but I just want to be a senator's wife I mean can you imagine me in the White House? A Jew and married seven times?"""

So we picked up Diana Vreeland and Jamie Auchincloss the half-brother of Jackie O. and Ruth Warrick who I know from years ago. She was on As the World Turns and now she is Phoebe in All My Children. She was Orson Welles's first wife in Citizen Kane. she is very good. The first thing she said when she saw me was ""Your Soup Can changed this country."" We got to the theater and I have never seen a crowd that big not for anyone so many people. Liz Taylor and Halston sat behind us Sammy Davis was in front of us with his wife Altovise. Liza was on for the whole show. The Halston clothes were beautiful they really were. I asked Halston to make me up a black sequined tuxedo with light blue shoes too. It was so beautiful the boy suit. Everything was sequins in all different colors. Liza's lost a lot of weight. Martin Scorsese's parents were saying hello to me. He directed The Act. Victor was putting down the clothes saying there was nothing creative about them which surprised me that he would put down Halston's stuff. But he is into punk now. When the show finished people were doing the ""bravo"" thing. Sammy Davis was standing up doing that. Liz Taylor yelled at me for leaving Diana alone. She was glaring at me for some reason giving me that look like she would scratch my eyes out. And Liza came over and was kissing Liz so much for the photographers that I did not talk to her. She and Jack Haley were not accepted into River House yet so they are at the Park Lane Hotel. Jack Haley was sweet he told me that Liza may want a portrait. We dropped off Diana and then Victor and I went over to Studio 54 ($4). It was jammed with beautiful people. Now Studio 54 has its liquor license. Stevie took me over to meet Vladimir Horowitz and his wife who is the daughter of Toscanini. He was thrilled to be there in his seventies about but chipper but when he got up he tripped. I wanted to get out of Studio 54 because there were so many beauties trying to get my phone number and I was inviting everybody down to the office so I had to leave."

They still did not have a guest host. Jon picked me up in his car. Made a lot of phone calls trying to find the new Maud Frizon shoe store ($.60). And then we found out it was on 57th between Madison and Park (cabs $5 $6 $3 $4.50). Still we could not find it and there was a crowd of people in the street and I asked one of them if they knew where the Maud Frizon store was and they said that that is what the big crowd was looking at. They said ""Cher's in there."" So everyone was looking in the store at Cher trying on shoes. So we went in and I was too embarrassed to look at her. And Sonny Bono was there too with his girlfriend Susie Coelho who is really beautiful. And I guess these people just buy clothes and shoes all day because Rupert told me he saw Rod Stewart in Parachute buying a few thousand dollars' worth of clothes and reading Interview. And Sonny and Susie were trying on shoes and Sonny had on the exact same leather Armani jacket that Jon had on but his was in brown and Jon's was in black. And the shoes Jon liked they were out of they said Rod Stewart had bought ten pairs the day before. So then we were leaving and a boy who worked there asked if we wanted to go out the back door and then he said ""Cher said that she would be honored if you did her portrait"" so that was great and Jon said I should go back inside not let that slip through my fingers. So I did and we talked and she is at the Pierre."

It started at 6:00 on the nose and it went from Westbeth to Washington Square and it was the funniest group of people one was dressed as a table and lamp. Picked up Jon (cab $7.50) he was cutting holes out of a hanky to make a mask. Went to Studio at 2:00 and it was the best party they have ever done. They had girls with live snakes and a haunted house and I did not see Steve Rubell at all. Chris was a doctor and Peter was a nurse. Robin Williams was there.

Because I have decided to do a real photo book of real apartments. Real Apartments. Not photograph houses the way Architectural Digest does but do just what people really live like. is not that a good idea? Bianca just got a ten-room apartment at the El Dorado it just went co-op so they are all up for sale and people are trying to make a killing. So cabbed to the El Dorado ($5). The lady showed us three apartments and the first was two faggots who'd just bought a loft so they were selling and then one that belonged to a lady I guess in her eighties and she had doilies and things on the sofas. It looked like a Barbra Streisand kind of place. Oh and on Page Six in the Post a few days ago there was a headline: ""Warhol Man Does Mick Jagger's Apartment"" and then the item said that Jed was the director of Bad and now he decorates apartments and they said they asked him about it and he said ""No comment."" And there was an article on survivors in the Daily News last Sunday-they asked Lester Persky about me and he put me down he said I was a has-been it was funny. And I do not think I told the Diary this but Tom Baker our star of I a Man died. He O.D. would. Mickey Ruskin had a wake for him."

I did not want to go alone so I waited on the corner for Fred and Mary Richardson to pick me up and we cabbed to 55th and Sutton Place to Le Club. The paparazzis were all there Ron Galella and everybody. Caroline and John-John were there and Eunice Shriver-I think it was her-and Ethel. The only grownups missing were Jackie and Ted. And Jean Kennedy Smith. Fred and I were at the old folks' table. Eunice told me that she likes madonnas and I told her that I was doing Modern Madonnas and I am going to call her to come down to the office. Michael gave a speech about how he loved Frank Gifford and it was like having a new father. And the little ten-year-old gave a speech about how when Michael was in a car and had to go to the bathroom he pissed in a beer bottle and they were all telling him to shut up but he would not. And Robert Jr. gave the best speech he will probably be better than Teddy he will probably be the one. But the funniest Kennedy was the one who was dancing with his girlfriend's purse and being like a fairy. They all dance pretty good. Kerry wrote some songs and they all sang them. Mary kissed all the boys she knew them all. I was then invited to a boat party that Calvin Klein and Elton John were giving down at that boat called the Peking where Yves Saint Laurent had the Opium party that I would missed so I wanted to go. Elton John had given a concert for 400000 kids in the park. Fred wanted to take Mary and Kerry and a bunch of boys so we got a limo outside to go downtown. It was a beautiful night. And I saw some interesting people there like Joe Dallesandro. And Archie and Amos's vet who is so good-looking Dr. Kritsick was there. And John Samuels. Every model in town. Lester Persky was running around after every model there.

He showed me his high school equivalency diploma and so he really did stick with it and get it that is good. I worked on the Gotti drawing. Left at 8:00 to go to Madison Square Garden to see Elton John (tickets $40). He came out like an angel in a halo with a red wig plus a tommy-hawk wig. And oh God is he fat. He had on a silver-lame caftan but tight-a skintight caftan-and the audience loved him. People were coming up to me the whole time for autographs. This big butch guy thanked me for giving his girlfriend one and then he walked her to the bathroom and she is so lucky it is so nice to have someone care about you. When they came back he thanked me again. At 10:00 Elton was still going strong but I had to leave to go to Indochine to meet Wilfredo.

They walked you in and walked you out. Gerard Malanga asked me for my autograph. Taylor Mead was there. Rene Ricard. The paintings looked really great everyone seemed to like them. Iman was on the scene she is broken up with her husband. Tony had people downstairs for champagne but it was the same old people and the same old talk. My dates were two stores- Lee from Matsuda and Philip from Fiorucci plus Benjamin. Talked to Madelaine Netter who was in running clothes. Fred had Sabrina Guinness bring David Lee Roth. I was wearing the Stefano jacket with Jean Michel Basquiat's picture painted on the back but I have decided I can not wear odd things I look like a weirdo. I am going to stay in basic black.

A beautiful day. We went straight to the Brandywine River Museum and then someone there took us to Frolic Weymouth's house. He had a tent over the whole place and good chicken salad. All the right people were there. Lady Bird Johnson Henry and Shirlee Fonda rich old ladies who look like bulldogs. Then we went over to Jamie Wyeth's who spent the whole time giving an interview to WWD and Phyllis was in the pool. I talked to Shirlee Fonda. She said they sold their East Side New York house on 79th Street to David Brenner but then he backed out at the last minute he said that he was too famous to own a house. She said that if Henry Fonda could own a house David Brenner could too. But she is very happy because now they are renting the house for $5000 a month and making more money that way. When she was cleaning the place out she found a big gold cross worth about $20000 behind the bookshelves and they are going to try to find out who it belonged to. She said that she would not have felt right keeping it. I could see that Suzie really wanted it badly she likes gold crosses. We went back to Frolic's to change. The girls got into their ball gowns. Oh and Henry Fonda has all his teeth. He was eating green apples. I am sure they are his because they are sort of darkened. Suzie was rolling a joint and it was embarrassing. I had one of those peppermint drinks mint julep and I threw it out. Suzie forgot to feed the driver and that was terrible. At the museum Frolic introduced me to Governor Scranton and his wife and some old ladies. Had a few drinks pictures dinner. Marina Schiano and Jed changed placecards so they would be next to each other they were not happy. I was next to Nancy Hanks on one side and the sister of Henry Mcllhenny Bonny Wintersteen on the other side. Nancy Hanks is the head of the National Endowment for the Arts I guess she got Jamie on her advisory committee The National Council on the Arts. Bonny Wintersteen was fascinating and fun. she is fat with grey hair pulled back very tight. She sold her ten most famous paintings to the Japanese a few years ago when they were going for very high prices she said she got tired of people showing up at her house and demanding to see them. I met a lot of kids in black tie who said they met me twenty years ago at the University of Pennsylvania when Edie and I went there for my show. We left at about 10:30 and I fell asleep in the car.

They had a tent for food and a tent for dancing and lots of security people. I sat next to a lady who said she had a sore thumb and I asked her if it was a ""murderer's thumb."" She was awful. She said she was ""Mrs. Goldenson"" and I asked her who she was and she said ""If you do not know I am not going to tell you"" and I would ask her another way and she would say ""You should know so why should I tell you."" Later on I found out her husband is a chairman at ABC Leonard Goldenson. But she was so rotten I did not talk to her for the rest of the night. Then Bob found me and said that Mrs. Potamkin-Luba-who does the TV ads for Potamkin Cadillac was dying to meet me so we went and found her. And Bert Parks was there and I was so excited Bob and I had been sitting at his table and I started talking to Mrs. Bert Parks and she got a little fresh she pushed her tits against me. And then Bob saw I was getting into trouble and came over and put his arm around her to distract her and she squeezed his ass and then Bert saw that she was getting fresh and said ""let us go dance darling."" I think everybody must have been somebody. Everybody was rich and straight a new crowd. All rich old people and attractive young girls for the old fogies. They started serving breakfast at 1:00. They had huge seashells made out of ice. Bob was telling me that everybody wanted portraits but I was so drunk I did not care."

At the airport ran into Johnny Nicholson of the Cafe Nicholson. Bought magazines ($10). On the plane I found a good review of Bad-twenty-five movies opened in Paris this week and Bad was the one getting all the publicity they are saying it is the first ""punk"" movie. they are calling me the Queen of Punk."

But it is worth it when you get a fat check. We were supposed to work until 5:30 but we finished by noon. We went out to 45th Boulevard or whatever it was in Long Island City. The twenty Japs were waiting. And the crew-ten American guys so good-looking. Like Mafia or Irish. With the gay fashion look of bracelets and pink shirts and pink belts. they are straight but that is how those film-crew guys dress now. We decided to go to dinner at the Cafe Seiyoken at 9:30. Picked up Bianca who was staying at the house of Marcie Klein's boyfriend. And I guess Calvin really is trying to have a hot media affair with his assistant Kelly. And Bianca was trying so hard to get him. So we went to Cafe Seiyoken and I introduced Bianca to Keith Haring. I bet she wants him to do a mural for free in her apartment. She says she wants to interview him for Interview and she also wants to interview Rauschenberg and all the artists. Rauschenberg was there. He was drinking Jack Daniel's and he came over and he was sweet. I think he said he is working on costumes for Laurie Anderson but the Cafe Seiyoken is so noisy though you can not talk to people (dinner $450). I do not think I will go back again because of the noise but they are advertisers so it was good to go. Then Steve sent his driver to pick us up to go to meet them at that VanDam restaurant. And so we went and in addition to Steve and Ryan and Farrah Bob Colacello was there. And Bob looks good he was his old story-telling self. Ryan is so desperate he calls you ""Baby"" and ""Honey"" and he kisses all the boys on the lips it is so sick. Farrah was also so peculiar. She made Keith draw on her arm. And then Ryan and Farrah were nervous so they took a walk around the block to smoke a joint. Because I guess it was tense because Bianca had had an affair with Ryan. Then I raved to Steve about Area the new disco at 157 Hudson Street and we went there. I would been to the opening the other night and so the guy let us in but Steve shoved him aside and motioned us all in the door. It was funny it was (laughs) like he was the club owner and letting us in but he would never even been there before. Marcie Klein was there and she could only talk about wanting to meet Rob Lowe. Then it was 3:00 and Bianca wanted to go so I dropped her at Marcie Klein's boyfriend's house and then dropped Marcie on 83rd Street (cab $10)."

I could not work with Jon because he had to go to a gay cancer funeral at Paramount it was a secretary there-a male secretary. And I mean I get so nervous I do not even do anything and I could get it. I made a mistake and blurted to Maura about Bianca seeing that Connecticut senator Dodd who is not divorced yet and then I realized Maura worked for Page Six but she is a good Democrat so she said ""do not worry I know when something would ruin somebody's political career."""
"Saturday, September 2, 1978",[Herbert Levine],0.12962962962962962,Went out and bought props for drawings (fruit $23.80). Got a load of 1950s used shoes down on Canal Street for $2 a pair. it is just the shoes I used to draw all the Herbert Levine shoes with the creative lasts. Shoes first got really pointy in '54-55 and then they got round in '57. I went in the back and I tried to paint but my painting was not too good. I was working on a German guy.

The door was open when we got there. There was a tent set up in the back Donald Bruce White was catering. I was jealous of the bride because she had on a $145000 string of pearls from Tiffany's. This is the woman who was a real madam who Bill cast in his play that Maxime de la Falaise and Denise Bouche were also in. I left her name off the present I brought-on purpose. It was a Shoe. It was a small party. Ludwig is Bill's new dachshund and he is different from little Tommy who was run over but he is nice. I gave him food so he liked me. They were cutting the cake and this guy came over and said he wanted to talk to me and he took me aside and I thought he was going to say some nice things and suddenly he was so mean! He was the boyfriend of the madam's girlfriend. I do not know what was bothering him. I was afraid to get up I thought he would swing at me. John Reinhold and I left quickly and John said to me ""Why did not you look at his suit because then you never would have talked to him."""

A boy picked me up and I took him into Christie's with me his name was O'Riley and he said he would written a paper on me in school but then after being so thrilled he talked about a ""girlfriend"" so I was let down but I did not care he was a nice kid. Walked all the way to the office. Called Jean Michel Basquiat and he was going to a party at Madam Rosa's that club downtown so went there (cab $6) and it is a cool place-when somebody famous comes in nobody cares. Then we left to walk over to Odeon for dinner and there was this ""hooker"" on the street and it turned out to be Jane Holzer. She was so fat I could not believe it. She said ""we are shooting a Lou Reed video. I am in it."" She was in costume. I hate Lou Reed more and more I really do because he is not giving us any video work.

It was Wilson Kidde and Billy Kimball-he is a friend of Wilson's who goes to Harvard-John Reinhold Robert Hayes Curley Keller Donovan the decorator Rupert and his new friend-there were ten of us all boys so it was embarrassing. I heard an older couple at the next table say (laughs) ""Oh it must be a prep school with their headmasters"" because John and I looked the oldest and the kids were all in ties and jackets. We had a good time (dinner $300). Then we decided to go to Cowboys and after that we went to Rounds. A guy there said he met me in Tennessee and he asked if he could sit with us to see what New York was really like ($105). Joe MacDonald was there and said that Flamingo was reopening so we went and the guy let us in free because I would judged a male beauty contest there. Flamingo was great because it was brand-new and then at 3:00 Thomas Ammann dropped me off."

Got in free to the primitive art show where they have the old primitive stuff and the new stuff beside it to show what had been taken from what. Then went to see the Irving Penn show and it was all the photographs that I remember so well that were what made me come to New York in the first place. It was fun to see them again they were not anything so different but... And I kept thinking that I should have bought a camera when I first came to New York because photography was wide open and if you could just do what was ""as good as"" you could be big. I mean you took a picture of a famous person and how could you go wrong? I would be doing TV commercials today. Things would have been different. it is just something to think about. And Irving Penn's photos it is funny to see that the models were all older like thirty-five. He used his wife a lot-Lisa Fonssgrives. And I remember so well that one photo where the things spill out of the girl's purse and it is tranquilizer pills and things. The shows were wonderful. And Steve Rubell asked if we wanted to see his new club-to-be. it is the Palladium Theater on 14th Street that was originally the Academy of Music. So he took us over there and it was ""Do you love it? Do you love it?"" And it is huge. Some famous Japanese architect is doing it."

Went to the Ace Gallery for my Torso show. It was a beautiful sunny day 100 degrees but dry. The show looked good-cocks cunts and assholes. They had 1000 copies of Interview ready to be given away. I did two interviews-one with Connoisseur magazine and one with Society West. Wendy did them with me and Fred was being funny and lied and told everyone that the shaved vagina in the painting was Wendy's. Then we went to Polly Bergen's house in Holmby Hills. Polly's house is very modern and well-decorated. There were Architectural Digests everywhere. And her dressing room looks like a department store with racks of blouses and skirts and dresses and gowns and she has a telescope that is for looking at the stars but she uses it to look at the stars' houses and we looked into Danny Thomas's house across the canyon but nothing was happening there except a few geraniums were growing. Then back to our dump (room service tea with tip $3 breakfast $2). Wendy made a phone call to Stan Dragoti to invite him to the opening-he is really unhappy about Cheryl Tiegs running off to Africa with Peter Beard. Then it was time to go off to Julia Scorsese's and she told Fred on the phone to be sure no one we brought had any drugs on them because she is trying to get more straight. We got to Julia's and everyone was sitting around smoking joints. Tony and Berry Perkins Firooz Zahedi and his fiancee a lot of young writers and composers. Tony asked us how was Chris Makos doing these days he said Chris was the biggest hustler but that he was so seductive you ended up giving in. He asked me if I liked L'Ermitage and I said it was a good quiet place to have an affair and he said ""But could you have two affairs there?"" And Doug Christmas told us earlier that Ronnie Levin had had a friend keep the receptionist busy while he walked in took one of my drawings out of the frame rolled it under his arm and walked out. Then he had the nerve to try to sell it back to the gallery and they pressed charges and the police said he had a record a mile long. Fred's outfits on this trip were his new shirts from London-they are really long so they look like Indian tunics-and Sue Mengers said to Fred ""In New York your hair is slicked back you wear beautiful suits and gorgeous ties and in L.A. your shirt's hanging out there is no jacket no tie-oh I know you you probably said 'This is good enough for those Hollywood Jews.'

Ran into Ronnie Cutrone and a whole bunch of forty people and they had just come from Ronnie's show that said on the invitation ""In memory of my father."" And Benjamin and I had intended to go but then we were carrying things home and just forgot but you can not say ""I forgot."" So it was really embarrassing. Tony Shafrazi was there and Keith Haring and Lou Reed looking so glum so peculiar. His wife looks more Puerto Rican every time I see her. I do not know if Lou is big or not. Rolling Stone gave his album four stars but was it a hit? Ronnie said Lou's in A.A. so I guess he is not drinking. But Sam the next night was telling me that he saw Lou at the Ninth Circle drinking but maybe he was just there picking up boys. But then he lived in that neighborhood anyway so maybe he was just hanging out. Ronnie said that when he goes to visit Lou in the country that he is always just bought another motorcycle and another piece of land. So after I would sat there so long with this Harper & Row guy Craig Nelson he still had not gotten the check and how long can you wait so I asked for the check and he did not offer to pay it. It was $100 with tip. Dropped Craig Nelson at his pad on Avenue A (cab $8)."

He sort of resents her though-he said she is been in and out of mental hospitals and he felt neglected. But he does not have to be ashamed of her she was really nice and everything. His father was a no-show. they are divorced and the father is living with another woman. he is an accountant. And Jean Michel Basquiat still keeps a room for $250 a day at the Ritz Carlton. And that fifty-foot concrete table that he had Freddy the architect do up special for the Great Jones place it filled the whole room and Jean Michel Basquiat just broke it up into pieces. And I found out from Robert Laughlin who is next door to Freddy's place that used to be Kenny Scharf's that when Freddy moved into Kenny's apartment there were just Kenny Scharf paintings everywhere all over the walls and Freddy painted them out! He painted it all white! He did not even remove the doors that had paintings on them which would have been so easy to save!

The one Barbara Allen ""auditioned"" for. The movie-I am not sure I think it was a light comedy. It did not say anything though. it is good in the beginning and you think something's going to happen but it does not. The new girl Mary Steenburgen is okay-she is good but not beautiful. She looks a little like Anjelica and you just know that is why he did it and he just should have used Anjelica but that is when they were having the Ryan O'Neal troubles. And you know I was thinking the other day about commercial movies and then all the great art movies and I have decided something: Commercial things really do stink. As soon as it becomes commercial for a mass market it really stinks. I know I always rave and say my favorite movies are things like The Other Side of Midnight and The Betsy but I guess I am ... going to change my tune. You have to do stuff that average people do not understand because those are the only good things. And even though the arty foreign movies are boring to sit through at least they try to do creative things. So I am going to start going to the New Yorker and seeing strange movies again. I am missing so much going to parties. I was a little drunk and I went over to Jack and said I really really loved it because Fred told me those kind of things really do make a difference to people. Afterwards Catherine and I went into this place on 54th Street that said ""Female/Male Nudes"" and there were almost naked girls on like a big long banquet table with men sitting around and it is so abstract. They put their tits and asses into the guy's faces an inch away and the guys just sit there like zombies. And there is a sign that says ""Do Not Touch."" And one of the hookers looked at me and said ""Oh my God oh my God."" And then the girls came over and one said ""Oh will you buy me a drink?"" And I did-I (laughs) did not know yet that the drinks were $8.50 apiece. And then more girls came and they made me feel really good like I was straight and they kept saying to come upstairs that upstairs was really really really fun. What do you think was up there? Is that where they do it? And the girl told Catherine she would really like it up there too she was trying to make Catherine and I bought drinks for the other girls so that is 3 X $8.50 plus $5 tip ($30.50) and then 8 X $8.50 plus $20 ($88) until I ran out of money. Then we left and went next door to a gay porno movie. Catherine wanted to see it and it was a glory-hole movie and it was too peculiar and we just stayed for ten minutes (cab $3)."

Then we went to the Famous Restaurant and each reporter came up to talk to me and there were a hundred of them and I signed a lot of autographs and talked a lot and I had to be photographed eating everything like gefilte fish. I would never had it before. It was okay. That was real hard work and afterwards we were exhausted so they took us back to the hotel where we rested up for the opening.

I got my pictures of the wedding back from Chris's ex-assistant Terry who is making prints for me now and Madonna really knows how to do her makeup in that great Hollywood way. Somebody must have showed her or always does it for her-everything painted just perfectly. Sean's going to be the new Dustin Hoffman. he will be around a long time. Then decided to go to the Pyramid club to see Ann Magnuson. She does ""Edie and Andy"" and ""Gala and Dali"" and ""Prince and Fallopia."" Like Apollonia get it? The intellectual girl of downtown.

When Catherine and I got to Halston's there were just a few people there just sitting around-Halston Nancy North Rupert and his boyfriend who lives with him. Victor was not there yet. Halston showed me the birthday cake and it had money all over it and Halston was going to burn the money but I said no that everybody should get the money with a piece of cake when you cut it so Halston made flowers out of the bills for on top of the cake he really is clever. Then Victor arrived in the green Halston fur coat that Interview photographed Sophia Loren in. He brought his Chinese friend from San Francisco Benjamin the one who was in drag the other night at Xenon and he really looked like a pretty girl. Arman and Corice were there and they gave Victor one of those language computers that have different tapes and you push good morning and it shows you bonjour. Victor was not too impressed with any of the presents and instead of cutting the cake nice with each piece having money he grabbed up all the bills and put them into his shopping bag. He was disgusting. Catherine and Dr. Giller were making out. Everybody hands me Quaaludes and I always accept them now because they are so expensive and I can sell them.

Looked at the movies decided to see The Ten Commandments (cab $4 tickets $10 popcorn $10). And let me go on record: Cecil B. DeMille is the worst director ever. we would missed an hour but it was still three hours to go and a half-hour intermission. And all those actors were terrible. I mean Edward G. Robinson forget it. And forget Yvonne DeCarlo and Ann Baxter too. Charlton Heston was okay he was good-looking. The orgy scene was (laughs) people dropping grapes on each other-it sounds like an old Andy Warhol movie right? And then they would lift their skirt two inches off the floor. That was it. That was the orgy. Edward G. Robinson-you could not believe it. And Dustin Hoffman is going to wind up in his shoes I just know it. The movie finished. Benjamin had called in the afternoon and said that Victor was coming in from L.A. for a birthday party for him at Halston's. And that made me nervous after hearing about Marvin Gaye's father shooting him. I could just picture Victor going nuts and jumping out a window or something dramatic. And by the way last week when I was trying to clean up I picked up a box and out fell the picture of Marvin and me that PH took in like 1976. Went home glued then I went over to Halston's. Wait a minute somebody's ringing my doorbell ... it is those stupid Polacks again. they are still coming over and ringing my bell! So okay at Halston's at midnight Victor arrived. I gave him a framed Keith Haring T-shirt and he hated it and threw it away but then he said he wanted it back for the frame. he is staying at the Barbizon I think. And then Alana Stewart arrived and Bianca and Alana wrestled on the floor for fun and I would have gotten the best pictures but I would forgotten my camera.

Marsia had hidden eggs all around the apartment like unscrewing the light bulb and putting an egg there and under pillows and the kids went looking. Jade found most of them and threw them on the floor. The real eggs not chocolate. Andrea Portago was there and this is a secret-she is the new Nina Ricci girl. they are reviving that Rich Girl promotion idea for perfumes they have been looking for a long time. Remember last year when they interviewed Barbara Allen? Andrea said she was out with Dennis Hopper and they went up to Elaine's and she started playing backgammon with Elaine and she won one and Elaine won one and then they started a third game and Andrea was losing and then she won and Elaine got mad and called her a ""rich bitch"" and told her not to come in there again.

And I actually was so happy it would be great to be in the fashion business. I am not going to give him the million and a half myself but I said I would talk to Fred about finding investors for him and then we could have a part of the business for setting it up. And Stephen gave me two wigs (tea $25) and went home and talked to Fred and he agreed it was a good idea. Called Jon who is in town and staying at his own apartment on the West Side and then walked over across the park to meet him and ran into Archie and Amos on their day off and they did not even recognize me. I was-crushed. They were off their leashes and they were with Jed and they did not give me a thought.

And Tatum was dancing with Mona Christiansen. And Stevie said that Liza was dying for Marty Scorsese to get back to town because Baryshnikov just sees too many girls. I worked all afternoon and then I watched Holocaust and kept making myself more fresh grapefruit juice and vodka and kept passing out. They gassed the little girl. I was thinking everybody really is in their own little world. They tell you to do something and you do not know what is going on they are the ones who know you are at their mercy. So maybe the Germans were saying the Jews were really bad so they had to kill them-oh but then no they would been living together with them so long they were right next door so they knew they were not bad. But it is like when you go to a hospital-they take you and they do anything with you because you do not know about their world. Or it is like investing in art you trust people or investing in stocks you do not know so you accept what they say is good or bad or even sports. Or terrorist groups they are out in the street handing you things and they are in their own world. But still today if somebody said ""We have to do this to the Puerto Ricans"" I mean could you do it? You could not. So how did they do it? I mean think of some German you actually know: could they do it or ... But if you do it once you can do it again and again that is for sure.

"Sunday, April 22, 1984","[Anais Nin, Katy Dobbs, Ned Rorem, Robert Hayes]",0.09232622275385433,"-New Hampshire-New York I was up in New Hampshire just over the Massachusetts border in Hampton Beach with Jon's old friend Katy Dobbs near where Jon's family has a beach house. Katy talks a mile a minute so it made things easier. It was so beautiful up there I want to get a house there too. it is like Montauk. On the ocean. But they have put in bigger windows so the whole view is a window. And they are winterizing the houses up there. And it was too hard to put the curtains down so I left them up so the sun woke me up every morning really early. I was reading the Ned Rorem diaries while I was up there. From the sixties to '71. He missed the whole scene that we were part of though- he was back in the elegant forties and fifties still. He puts me down a couple of times I guess. It was Easter and we went to see a friend of Katy's. Fred her boyfriend who is on the Nickelodeon cable TV channel was in Tennessee for a whistling contest. he is so talented and cute. They call him ""Andy"" because he looked like me with white hair-the Phil Donahue look-but after meeting me and seeing how old I actually am now they call him ""Son of Andy."" He did the voices for two of the gremlins in the new Spielberg movie and he got $500 a day. that is not much. Three days' work. The gremlins are forty minutes of the movie. Oh and on Easter services they got up at 4:30 to go but I could not go. I did not want to go because I would feel too peculiar in a church where they might see me praying and kneeling and crossing myself because I cross the wrong way I cross the Orthodox way. And they would be looking. Then when they came back we took a ride and then went to Jon's family's house for lunch. They had about ten people. Lunch was outside. They have Christmas-tree kind of trees. The twin brothers Jon and Jay were both wearing bright green pants. they are all macho but they like to freak for the weekend. The brother just broke up with a beautiful model who lives in New York who I met once. he is in his father's business. Insurance. He just bought a house of his own up there. I have not heard anything about Robert Hayes. Ned Rorem met Anais Nin just so he could be in her diary and she could be in his. And I want to do that too-I want to find somebody else who does a diary now so we can be in each other's. And also in the morning the Easter Bunny came and I ate chocolates in bed. And then it was time to get a ride to Boston and get the shuttle to New York (tickets $171 magazines and newspapers $5)."
"Sunday, April 23, 1978","[Barbara Allen, Baroness Von Thyssen, Chris Hemphill, Diana Vreeland, Elsa Peretti, Gianni Agnelli, Jerry Hall, Joe Eula, Saul Steinberg]",0.027079629629629634,"Bob said he and Kevin had had dinner with Diana Vreeland and that Diana was saying that I was not avant-garde anymore. She said that the book Bob and I are doing the photography book-Chris Hemphill brought it over to show her-was not avant-garde and she said that Jackie O. had said I was not avant-garde either. So it is all just Chris Hemphill saying these things blabbing to both of them and then them repeating it. Because they do not even know what I do. And Diana was saying how great Saul Steinberg was and Bob told her ""he is just an illustrator."" She must be mad at Fred or something and that is why she is putting me down because I can not believe it we had such a good time together that night last week she was so much fun. And Chris Hemphill is doing her book for her. Fred set that up. Then Stevie called and told me to ask Bob to invite Elsa Peretti he said he did not care about that fight in the basement that he did not care that she called him a kike. So I picked up Catherine and we went over to Halston's. Then the doorbell rang and Joe Eula came back and said that it was Barbara Allen-I would told her about Halston's party-and Halston got offended and said ""This was supposed to be a small party!"" And then Barbara came in with Gianni Agnelli and Baron and Baroness Von Thyssen who I did not recognize but I guess they thought I was ignoring them because of the painting they sent back a few years ago. And Bianca and Dr. Giller had gone to the Erotic Bakery and gotten a big marzipan cake of a cock fucking an ass and then another one of just a cock. Over on 70th and Amsterdam. They have the stuff in the windows and the cookies are chocolate tits. And Bianca brought the cake in and she put the cock and balls up against her and it was coffee-colored so she looked like Potassa the drag queen. Halston was pretending to eat it and suck it. And Catherine made a faux pas and said the chic thing would be to cut the cake and eat it and he said ""No that would not be chic."" He was high and he wanted to leave it uncut. As I sat there looking at Bianca I started getting more and more nervous about Interview's cover story next month on Jerry Hall. We stayed at Halston's until about 1:00 drinking then we went over to Studio 54 in limos. Gianni Agnelli did not come with us he went home to wait for a call about the Moro kidnapping-he is somehow involved with working out a ransom deal with the terrorists. The baron and baroness came and somehow we got lost from Stevie. They did not understand about going to the basement. And Stevie had the basement decorated now with scarves and candles and popcorn but it is (laughs) like going to a St. Mark's Place hippie pad."
"Sunday, April 25, 1982","[Barry Diller, David Geffen, Steve Rubell]",-0.375,Picked up Jon to go to the park. By accident ran into his boss Barry Diller who was with Calvin Klein David Geffen and Steve Rubell out together for a walk. It was sort of a shocking moment. Everybody looked guilty for something.
"Sunday, April 26, 1981","[Anna Wintour, Catherine Guinness, Chris Makos, Jon Gould, Michael Stone]",-0.07420735129068463,It was such a pretty day. Jon Gould walked me all the way downtown to the office then he went to the gym and I went to work. I did some Madonnas. Then I went to church for a minute. Chris Makos called and I said I was just too exhausted to make reservations anywhere for dinner so he did at Da Silvano. Jon called and he said he was free so I picked him up at work and cabbed down to Da Silvano ($8). it is just expensive Italian food that they try to do well (dinner $140). And Catherine Guinness's friend Anna Wintour was there with Michael Stone and I could not remember her name at first but then I did. She was just hired by New York magazine to be their fashion editor. She wanted to work for Interview but we did not hire her. Maybe we should have we do need a fashion person but-I do not think she knows how to dress she is actually a terrible dresser. Jon dropped me off and I got home and crawled into bed and fell asleep.
"Sunday, April 27, 1980","[Averil Meyer, Bill Pitt, Diana Vreeland, John Scribner, Mick Jagger, Nastassia Kinski, Stuart Lichtenstein]",0.12670454545454543,Nastassia Kinski came by the office. I was not friendly to her though because it turned out she already did the cover of Vogue and now we do not want to use her for the Interview cover but she really is beautiful. Picked up Catherine. Cab to Hector's on Third Avenue and 82nd Street ($4). it is run by Stuart Lichtenstein the kid who used to manage Max's. This was Averil Meyer's birthday party. She did not put us with her she was at a table with Diana Vreeland and Mick Jagger. And we were waiting to see where she would put John Samuels who she would slept with the night before. Then Fred invited all the fairies to come afterwards-Robyn and Curley and Curley's boyfriend and John Scribner and his current girlfriend. Not really fairies but that feeling. I had a good time with Bill Pitt. I asked him if he still thought he was God and he said yes but not as much. His father and Averil's father are best friends. He had a new camera that advances itself. And Averil's father was hitting Catherine really drunk and had her dress up practically over her head and his wife was just standing there. I thought Catherine would be Averil's new mother but then he has no money we found out. And Averil looked funny dancing with John Samuels because she was a foot taller in her shoes.
"Sunday, April 27, 1986","[Imelda Marcos, Mel Odom]",0.049666666666666665,"The day started out early with my brother John and his wife. And it is so odd it is two people you do not really know who look so different from you and their ideas are so weird and it is one more thing to make you think what is this life all about. Their son Donald is still in college he will get out in August and he is a computer expert so maybe we should hire him at Interview if it is not too late if we do not need somebody before then. Went to the flea market and ran into Billy Boy with Mel Odom. When the sun was out it was hot but when it was in it was cold. Billy Boy was not in a money-spending mood. They really see him coming and jack the Schiaparelli prices up. He could be good-looking he has good proportions but he stoops over and he is pigeon-toed so you do not notice. But then he is about 6'2"" and he had on a leopard jacket and tights and pointed shoes and a Chanel-type cross and dark glasses and no makeup. Imelda Marcos was on the news crying that she is still in Hawaii and it is like those English movies where the relatives come into the dungeon and say ""We love you darling but we have to cut off your head because it is the thing to do."""
"Sunday, April 29, 1979","[Dick Cavett, Henry Geldzahler, Kay Gardella, Lucie Arnaz, Ruth Warrick, William Weslow]",-0.0016865079365079357,"Cab to Ruth Warrick's on Park Avenue. I was a little late. Lucie Arnaz had already left. I was standing there and this really good-looking guy came over and then I realized it was William Weslow who used to be with the Ballet Theater twenty or thirty years ago. I was introduced to him a few times and he always ignored me he would never talk to me because I was nobody then. he is a masseur now Henry Geldzahler goes to him. He was fired from Balanchine in about 1970. He said that Balanchine said ""Listen darling you are too old we have seen you too much around and you are through darling. I hope you are not going to commit suicide darling are you?"" And he said he told him not for somebody like him-he would not give him that much pleasure. Balanchine does not like boys he only likes tall girls. So now he is a masseur. Dick Cavett uses him too-he said Dick's sent him about forty people. He made me feel his legs and (laughs) I giggled. It was such a weird party. When you go to places where people are sort of nobodies and you have to think of what to say to them it is so hard. I met Kay Gardella that is who I met. The newspaper television critic. And she is really fat. she is the fattest person I have met in years-most people are not fat anymore they are chubby. Nobody's really fat anymore."
"Sunday, April 4, 1982","[Anna Wintour, Brooke Adams, Jedd Garet, Michael Stone, Princess Schleswig, Steve Rubell]",0.12447044334975368,Chris called and said he wanted to go to the P.S. 1 thing out in Queens. This thing had gotten good writeups. And Henry Post's live-in boyfriend was exhibiting. The place was packed and it reminded me of years ago going to places like Settlement House for these types of things. But years ago they did have better people-Oldenburg and Whitman. Brooke Adams was there she was sweet she said hi. And Princess Schleswig-Holstein-Pingle-who we sort of let go from working at the office because she was such an egghead she was there and now she works at this place about one day a week. We had her give us a tour. And we saw Henry Post and looked at his boyfriend's stuff which was okay but it was just a copy of Jedd Garet. Jon really sees things in paintings that I do not see. Like there was an abstract painting and he saw all these figures of people painted over it. They were there but I had not seen them and paintings do have things to say but I never looked at them that way. There was a cocktail party that Henry was having at Anna Wintour's place where she lives with that Michael Stone. And Henry put down the Rauschenberg party the day before saying his was going to be so grand so chic. But I am beginning to think that maybe Henry does not really know what an elegant party is like that he has not been to many. Because this party-I mean they did not even really have food. It was 6:30 to 8:30 and it was broken-up crackers. It was on Broadway and 70th and 71st. And they had big trees and three maids but so what because there was no food. And the reason I am putting it down so much is because Henry put down Rauschenberg's so much saying how much better his was going to be. And Jed was there. I would asked Henry if he was going to be and he said yes that Jed was one of his best friends. And there were no stars. Steve Rubell was there. But the strangest thing is that he was with the prosecutor who sent him to jail! And I think Henry-who actually wrote the article that started all the trouble-I think Henry got them together. I mean it is like if somebody got you evicted from your apartment and then you decided the next year to be friends with them. Or is it trying to get involved with the guy who is smart enough to get you and getting him then involved in what you do.
"Sunday, April 6, 1980",[Shirley Goldfarb],-0.25,-Paris Easter. I had a horrible night. I had two nightmares about planes cracking open and the people falling out. Fred went out and ran into Shirley Goldfarb she said her eighty-eight-year-old mother in Miami Beach just sent her the $25 she sends her every Passover for matzoh balls.
"Sunday, April 6, 1986","[Glenn O'Brien, Jean Michel Basquiat, Miles Davis]",-0.03624999999999999,Jean Michel Basquiat was picking me up to go see Miles Davis at the Beacon and it was rainy and cold and I curled up and watched TV for a while and ate some garlic and then he called and said to meet him over there (cab $4). His cab arrived after mine and he had Glenn O'Brien with him and some other people. He and Glenn are friends again. B.B. King played first and he is just great. And then Miles Davis came out blond in gold lame and he plays really terrific music. High heels. Then we went to Odeon for dinner.

In the maid's room downstairs. Talked to Jim the houseboy who wants to be a dancer. Put on block-out sun lotion because I would gotten red on the grey day before. Continued to read Indecent Exposure and opened right to a page where they were talking about David Geffen so I read it out loud to him. Talked a lot to David Geffen. His father made brassieres. It turns out he was a person I did not know just one of those fringe people around Danny Fields and he knew Nico when she was with Leonard Cohen. And his new Donna Summer album got the greatest review ever it is going to make him $2.5 million by the end of the week. Went over to Gil de la Cruz's for a minute Diane Von Furstenberg was there. I think she loaned the fabric for the Hawaiian party. We got on a seaplane and took off and there were screams coming over the radio that there was a door open and it was mine I could have fallen out ($100). We ran into Michael Coady from Women's Wear where you land and he was not drinking so he was sweet. Then the pilot who seemed like he was from New York said ""Where can I get a cab?"" And so we told him and he walked with us and he said ""Maybe I can help you out."" I said what did he mean and he said he had the best cocaine and I said oh no no that I did not use it and so then he was embarrassed and so we walked the whole three blocks together without saying anything."

Went up to the Metropolitan Club where Ina was staying. Ina was in a black one-shoulder dress held up with a diamond pin that was maybe a Halston. She had on white shoes she was nice. Then cabbed to the Rainbow Room ($3.50). Liz Carpenter was there she used to be Lady Bird's social secretary. And she is big and fat and Texan and she was wearing an American flag dress with a watermelon across the front of it. And Peter Duchin said ""I know that dress is patriotic ... somehow."" It was wall-to-wall everybody rich and famous and you could not understand how they were all in town because it was August and then you know it is a great city if the convention could get all this together. Tom Brokaw was there and Barbara Walters with her beau and Ina knew everybody and was introducing us to everybody but I could only remember half of the names of the people I knew so I was not so good for her. John Tunney came over and put down Reagan and Bob got in a snit. John Tunney called me ""Peter"" though (laughs) and he thanked me for doing the Kennedy poster. He thought I was Peter Max. And then it was funny because then somebody came up and said ""Oh thank you for doing the Carter poster."" Saw Art Buchwald and Jan Cowles was there with her husband and Mrs. Graham we said hello to and later on goodbye to. Her daughter Lally was there with Alexander Cockburn. Ina introduced us to a girl named Dolly Fox a rich girl who is staying at the Ritz Towers and she is a runner but she has a pink ticket and that means she can go all the way to the president at the Sheraton. she is in high school still but she acts like an older person. Her mother Yolanda was a Miss America in the fifties. We invited Dolly to dinner with us at Pearl's. Pearl's was jammed with convention people. We got a table. And then Ina noticed that the Blair boy and his father Bill Blair the ambassador to Denmark were also having dinner and she went and invited them to join us but the boy said it was his eighteenth birthday and he would like to have it just with his father and that they would come over for coffee. Liz Carpenter was there with I.M. Pei and his wife and a woman who is the Secretary of Education Shirley something and she I think was drunk and tough and asked me my philosophy on education and I told her I could not even think and she said ""You have to! Quick!"" We ordered dinner. Bob got screaming and crazy for a second when Ina said something against Reagan but he caught himself and apologized. Ina and Jerry Zipkin want Bob to get them invited to Richard Weisman's lunch for Miz Lillian. Then the Blair kid came over and talked and he and Dolly sort of picked each other up. But Dolly is seventeen and acts forty and he is eighteen and acts ten. Dinner was cheap and we even had champagne for the boy ($125). Then we cabbed to Park to a party that Ina got us invited to given for the Rhode Island delegation. A lot of rich presidents of corporations. Alice Mason was there looking like a mammy in a turban and a red dress. She came over and said she was so thrilled to see me. Bob thought she was being mean but she was nice. Everybody thinks Carter will win on the first ballot and then they will have to work really hard to get him reelected. there is so many Democrats around. They had good coffee-you can always tell if a party's good by if the coffee's good. This may have been the kind from a restaurant that you get in a container. I do not know. Left there about 12:00 walked Ina back to the Metropolitan Club. Home around 12:30."

Got tickets for the Actor's Fund performance of are not Misbehavin (6 X $17.50). Cabbed to theater ($2) to meet Jay Johnson Tom Cashin Amy Sullivan and Ricky Clifton. Ricky was asked to leave Halston's the other night when Halston found him looking in his closets. He was not stealing he was just poking around and he was drunk and fresh with Halston it was 4 A.M. Saw the show. And now the Negroes know how to do satires on themselves and when you get that sophisticated it means you are part of the community so now they are.
"Sunday, August 14, 1983",[Phoebe Cates],-0.07722222222222222,Decided to go see Private School (cab $4 tickets $10 popcorn $6). I wanted to see Phoebe Cates. These movies are just like remakes of those French comedies of the sixties where it is older women after young boys. In this one it is ugly boys peeping in windows at girls and taking showers and rubbing themselves and these girls always have big tits. I guess that our movies did not make it because our girls always had such small tits.
"Sunday, August 16, 1981","[Leo Castelli, Ron Feldman]",-0.0933531746031746,I walked to church. Cabbed down to meet Rupert at 1:00 ($5). I called Fred in East Hampton and told him what a bad deal he would made with Ron Feldman that I was with Leo Castelli and that I was not supposed to be having a show with Ron Feldman in the first place and that having such a big show of mine would make his gallery famous and that the pictures were too big and too awful. Ron has me down for a show on September 18th or something. I did backgrounds for Superman and Dracula. I have to do at least four a day to catch up. At midnight I got a call from Jon he said he would done some work on the script and so I went over to pick it up (cab $3). I was back home at 1:05.

I had him talk to Gael call her in the country. he would probably do a good job. he will probably like one of those Interview girls. he is a good catch-he is cute and smart. If he works for us he will have to change his name to Warhol-I could not take a ""Warhola"" running around the office. Oh and Beauregard told me that Details is running a thing on people's real names. Like Annie Flanders was just something like Schwartz. It really worked for her. And Beauregard's real name was Billy Stretch. Went to the Cooper-Hewitt Hollywood show and there were so many people there looking at movie-star stuff. I can not believe there is not a movie museum anyplace. They had a Marlon there but somehow the placard had come off so I do not know who had loaned it."

And when I did not turn around she screamed ""Your mother's a whore."" that is a strange thing for a girl to yell. It brought back bad memories of Valerie Solanis and getting shot."

Chris Makos picked us up at 3:30 and we went to the Whitney to see the Walt Disney show (admission $8). It was really crowded and it was funny to see Walt Disney stuff on the walls. They did not show it off too well though. Mostly Mickey Mouse. Then we saw the Georgia O'Keeffe show on another floor and she does these flowers and slashes and all she does is paint vaginas. And we saw some other people's stuff and you can tell the girls' stuff always because it is simple things it is the easy stuff. You can tell. Then we took a ride and we wanted to go to the River Cafe but they were done serving so we stopped someplace outdoors in the Village and the food was awful ($70). But we watched everybody people with great chests just back from Fire Island and people cruising in gym shorts with their balls hanging out on purpose-horrible-looking people. Then we cabbed to the trendy West Side just to be seen-Columbus Avenue-it was eighteen deep people walking. it is like the 1930s with people trying to be discovered doing their acts on the street.

So I was all by myself but I had courage enough to go down to the office. I take a sharp stick with me in case the elevator doors stick so I can pry myself out. And if I go over there alone on the weekend 1 always tell someone I am going. Halston was trying all day to get Victor on the phone and finally he seemed calmed down because Dick Cavett and Bianca had come over and gone through The Importance of Being Earnest playing the parts together and that cheered him up. Worked till 7:00. Cabbed to meet Jean Michel Basquiat and Paige Powell ($5). And Paige is just so nutty she laughs so loud at nothing. I would but her in the category of schizophrenia. Jean Michel Basquiat said he never finished high school. I am surprised because I thought he went to college. he is twenty-two. Cabbed to Mr. Chow's ($5). And Lester Persky was there with the cute boy with white-blond hair who is training for the pentathalon. He wants us to put him in Interview. Lester's gotten so funny-looking like a little fat Hitler.

It was a hazy grey day. And in the park the Puerto Ricans were having some sort of event. It was not even Puerto Rican Day they just create a party and call it some occasion and then they have the park all day with mounted policemen beautiful mounted policemen on horses. Not one white person in the whole park.
"Sunday, August 3, 1980",[],0.10416666666666666,I got dressed and walked in the heat to church. I was going to go to work but it was so hot I did not want to see anybody. It was Archie's birthday and he is eight or nine or even older. I gave him a box of Hartz Mountain treats.
"Sunday, August 3, 1986",[Jimmy Swaggart],0.18214285714285716,Turned on TV and saw Jimmy Swaggart preaching and he had a huge auditorium of people bigger than Prince. Went to church and it was just organ music and then went to 26th Street to the flea market and while I was there I verified a fake-that a fake was a fake. It was a portrait of me actually a good copy. They did a good job they just did not frame it right and some of the cotton canvas with the white was showing.

And it was just like talking in a movie talking to Jack on the phone. It was so exciting. God it was exciting. Then John Denver was coming over for dinner and we would read all the gossip papers-The Globe The Star The Enquirer five of them-and we would read everything about John Denver going back to his wife and all of a sudden the doorbell rang and there they were and we said we knew all about them that they did not have to talk. And they thought it was funny. And they were adorable. I got drunk on champagne and later Fred accused me of name-dropping every second. John Denver said he was going to take me up on his private little airplane he said he would fly us the next day to where we were going-Fort Collins. He said that he knew all about me and that people always tell him he looks like me.

On my TV it really looks like good hair not dyed."

And all the people who I do not know Jean Michel Basquiat's just sitting there and then he will say ""Hi man."" He went to school with them or something. He told me he went to a school in Brooklyn St. Ann's that is sort of chic because you had to pay. And then he said that when his father lost money he had to be bussed to a public school that was a lot of Italians and the boys there used to beat him up and he did not like it. But I guess the education was good though and that is why he is smart. Then we got to the VIP room and it was like a remake of an old party. Janet Villella was there and Linda Stein and it was free drinks (tip $10). Then they came in and told everybody to leave and get out because Jermaine was coming in and that we could come back later that (laughs) some of us would be selected to come back. There were some sort of drag queens there with jewelry on and so we all had to get out it was so stupid. And you have to walk for a block to get to the next room. And the photographers there are so bored with seeing me they do not even say hi anymore. Hold on the other line's ringing.... Oh gee that was Benjamin calling and he said that he and Paige were at the Limelight and they heard I was in the VIP room and they tried to get in but could not. And-this is funny- he said that there were three Olympic guys there wearing their gold medals. So I guess those were the ones I thought were drag queens with jewelry! Gee. So anyway Jean Michel Basquiat wanted me to see his paintings down on Great Jones Street so we went there and it is a pigsty. His friend Shenge-this black guy-lives with him and he is supposed to be taking care of the place but it is a sty. And the whole place just smells so much of pot. He gave me some paintings to work on. Left there (cab $8)."
"Sunday, August 6, 1978",[Tom Cashin],-0.02,It was my birthday but I did not think of it until Vincent called and reminded me. I thought I was going to see are not Misbehavin' for the Actor's Fund but I was a week too early. So I called Tom Cashin and we got tickets to the American Dance Machine (cab $3 tickets 4 X $13 = $52). Raining. A few fans handed me notes.
"Sunday, December 1, 1985","[Harry Dean Stanton, Linda Stein, Matt Dillon, Susan Dey]",-0.026836069023569022,"It was rainy out and I sort of wanted to just sleep in. The dogs went away with Jed. I thought about the moths in my rug and I puttered around. Went to meet Wilfredo Bernard and PH at the Matt Dillon play Boys of Winter (cab $4). And the play I mean after Apocalypse Now what can you do? If it would come out eight years ago it would have been a smash hit. Everybody got killed and it was so sad but the ending was just too corny because the guy would never have killed his friend like that. And it is the gayest play on Broadway. One of the reviews should say that and then maybe it would be a hit. Because it is all men caring about each other. It was raining out and we walked toward Eighth Avenue. Got a limousine that was going by ($20). So we went to the Hard Rock and Matt was already there. He introduced me to his mother and remember I said the last time I saw him he gave me a pat on the shoulder and a kiss? Well last night he just gave me a pat on the shoulder. Maybe because it was in front of his mother. But then I started thinking that when he saw me the last time he was probably rehearsing for this play and he wanted to see how it felt to kiss a fairy in public. Sat with Linda Stein and she talked about trying to sell Stallone a house. He called her from his plane and said ""Linda? Sly. Just one thing before we talk at length later: If Elvis were alive today would he live in an apartment or a house!"" And I am trying to decide if I should try to sell him my house for $5 million. She says she will have to see it first. The house next door only went for $1.9 but who knows what she could get? Bernard went and got lost talking to Susan Dey at the bar. he is a would-be starfucker. Susan Dey was emotional about the play and said she was protesting war now. I do not know which war. Nicaragua I guess. We left and the rain had turned into a sparkling mist. And we passed a guy in a camouflage jacket going toward the Hard Rock and PH yelled ""Harry Dean!"" because she thought it looked like Harry Dean Stanton and it was so we talked for a minute. I always thought he was this teenager who just looked really bad because he would taken a lot of drugs but it turns out he is not a teenager-he is almost sixty so gee he looks good! Then Bernard and Wilfredo dropped me and I gave them a twenty because that is all I had. And then at work that afternoon I would spilled some tea on a stack of Polaroids of some portrait and then I could not unstick them they were all stuck together. With all those signs I would put up all over like ""Do Not Carry Water Into the Print Room"" and I wound up doing it."
"Sunday, December 11, 1983",[Peter Wise],0.22362012987012986,It was a grey day. Went to go look at the trees out at Averil's in Katonah where her husband is an emergency-room doctor and she just had twins. they have lent Fred a little shack on their property so we were going out there to see Fred's newest architectural adventure. Peter Wise rented a car and we picked up Fred and went out there (tolls and gas $10). And Averil's husband's so handsome. They live in a big comfortable house with a live-in maid and it is rich but sort of the shabby way. And it is this perfect family with Christmas trees and a dog and her husband who loves her and it is so amazing to think how wild she was just a few years ago.
"Sunday, December 12, 1976","[Jack Nicholson, Jackson Pollock, Ruth Kligman]",0.10776515151515152,"I read the Ruth Kligman book Love Affair about her ""love affair"" with Jackson Pollock-and that is in quotes. it is so bad-how could you ever make a movie of it without making it a whole new story? Ruth told me she wants me to produce it and Jack Nicholson to star. In the book she says something like ""I had to get away from Jackson and I ran as far as possible."" So do you know where she went? (laughs) Sag Harbor. He lived in Springs. So that is-what? Six miles? And she was making it like she went to the other side of the world. And then she said ""The phone rang-how oh how did he ever find me?"" I am sure she called hundreds of people to give them the number in case he asked them."
"Sunday, December 12, 1982","[David Keith, Diana Ross, Iris Love, Morgan Fairchild, Pauline Trigere]",0.1159090909090909,Got up early it had snowed out. Opened all the windows. Decided it was a good day for a walk. Met Chris and Peter at the Plaza. Went to the Edwardian Room. We had a long big lunch ($240 with tip). Went to Iris Love's party for Pauline Trigere at Dionysos at 210 West 70th St (cab $6). It was packed with stars-Diana Ross and some beau and Morgan Fairchild and David Keith-he was with another girl but he is girl-crazy so he was after Morgan. The Herreras from society were there and lots of the girls-Paloma and Fran and Marina and Florinda. There was Greek dancing. Iris changed into a Greek toga.
"Sunday, December 13, 1981",[Marlon Brando],-0.04166666666666665,Cabbed to Jon's apartment but his fuse had blown and so we went out looking for fuses because we wanted to work on scripts and then cabbed ($4.50) to my place and watched Apocalypse Now which looked really good on TV-and on a small screen Dennis was not so bad and neither was Marlon Brando. Jon left at 11:00.
"Sunday, December 14, 1980","[Ann Getty, Diana Vreeland, Tom Sullivan]",-0.029254850088183418,"I was in a cab with a black driver during the minutes that were supposed to be silence to remember John and pray for his soul. He had a black station on and they had a ten-minute silence and the disc jockey said ""we are up there with you John"" and the driver laughed and said ""Not me baby I am stayin' right down here."" So he turned to another station and that station was (laughs) talking about the silence. Catherine was thrilled because Tom Sullivan is back in town and he is telling her he loves her but he is full of baloney and she should be careful. She was leaving her key in the mailbox for him. Bob said that at the Ann Getty dinner we went to last night he heard Diana Vreeland tell off ""Suzy"" for saying in the newspaper that the lights in her Met show were too low. Diana said ""Now listen Aileen just in case you did not realize it the Metropolitan Museum is not a department store. Nothing there is for sale so we really do not have to light it up like Bloomingdale's."" And ""Suzy"" was mad but she could not think of a comeback."
"Sunday, December 15, 1985","[Sam Shepard, Stuart Pivar]",0.019218749999999993,After seeing the Sam Shepard play the night before I got up and read the transcripts of those days with Truman that I would taped where he is going to the masseur then to the psychiatrist then for drinks then for dinner but by talking in them so much myself I ruined them. I should have just kept my mouth shut. I was you know saying everything's wonderful and everybody's wonderful-the usual. I thought I could turn these tapes into plays and they would be my little fortune but they are not they are just awful. Paige said that she and PH were going over to Stuart Pivar's musicale because PH wanted to cover it for the Party book. The reason I do not want to go over there is because I just can not take hearing Archie and Amos barking in Jed's apartment next door on their weekends off. Do you know what I mean? PH called me afterwards and said it was the kind of event like in a comedy movie where the boy would bring his girlfriend there to prove he was sensitive that the men and women were very intellectual and dreamy sitting on the nineteenth-century chairs and things listening to the beautiful music.
"Sunday, December 16, 1984","[Jean Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf, Mia Farrow, Ray Johnson, Sam Havadtoy]",0.08971741221741221,Kenny Scharf called and said he was picking me up and that Sean Lennon was in the car with him. So I said in an hour but then I could not seem to be ready so then I heard a commotion out in front and I knew they were there but then I was afraid to go out. And while this was going on the phone rang and it was Jean Michel Basquiat from Sweden and when he heard these other kids were at my house he began to go crazy because he is never been there. But it is just that I do not like anything pre-planned. If he just dropped in or something it would be okay. So finally I went out and I had a camera with me and Sean took it and was taking pictures of me and said that he was waiting until I got sick of smiling and then he would take one. He got that technique from Yoko. And he dissertated on how he never knew what to do when photographers were around whether to smile or act or freeze. he is so smart. So we went to the West Side and we were going to pick up the Mia Farrow kids who live across from the Dakota-Sean plays with them-but then they did not come. And Yoko came and people just kept a distance from this car-it was great-with all these famous people in it. And we picked up Jon. We were thinking of a place to have lunch and I said the Odeon and she said oh yes so it seemed like she went there a lot but then she said she would never been that she did not really go out that much. And we picked up her I guess boyfriend although I can not figure it out if it is her boyfriend or what. Sam Havadtoy. You know if anything ever happened to Sean that would be the end of her I think. It really would. And I was telling her what a wonderful host Sean was at his birthday party and she said that the first time he had to do a party he hid under the couch. Yoko wanted to pay but I did (lunch $200). Her boyfriend was very nice. And Kenny's paintings are selling like crazy. His wife and son were along and they just bought a house on Suffolk Street way downtown where Ray Johnson used to live. Around Orchard over there. So he is being a man. A provider. I dropped Jon ($8). Then stayed home.
"Sunday, December 18, 1983",[],0.021913580246913575,Talked to Chris and Peter. They were decorating their tree and then they were going off to judge an underwear contest at the Pyramid Club on Avenue A. Cabbed to Chris's ($9). And Chris is so skinny that his eyeballs are sticking out. he is doing it for the same reason I was when I was down to 115-he thinks it makes him look young. But he does not look good thin. So when we get to Aspen I will have to get him on an ice cream binge.
"Sunday, December 19, 1976","[Keith Richards, Lou Reed]",0.01875,"Went to work (magazines and newspapers for week $26). Lou Reed called and that was the drama of the day. he would come back from a successful tour he was a big hit in L.A. but he said Rachel had gotten kicked in the balls and was bleeding from the mouth and he wanted the name of a doctor. Lou's doctor had looked at Rachel and said that it was nothing that it would stop but Lou wanted another doctor to check. I said I would get Bianca's. But then Lou called back and said he got Keith Richards's doctor to come over. I told him he should take her to the hospital. I was calling Rachel ""she"" because she is always in drag but then Lou calls him ""he."""
"Sunday, December 19, 1982",[],0.0,Decided to go to Vincent and Shelly's party. They had about eight babies there and all the kids from the office. Asked Jay as a Christmas present to please get me a cab.
"Sunday, December 2, 1984",[],-0.045138888888888895,And I forgot to say that on Friday Sean Lennon sent down the tablecloth from his birthday party in October for a souvenir. Maybe he wants a Christmas present. What can I get him? I was so disappointed when his song did not make it to the top ten-I thought it would.
"Sunday, December 21, 1980",[],-0.1159090909090909,Jed's decided to move out and I do not want to talk about it. The apartment he bought on West 67th Street to work in now he is decided he will live in it too. Went to church. Worked in the freezing cold at the office and I am not going to send in the rent.
"Sunday, December 21, 1986","[Anne Bass, Jane Wilson, John Gruen, Peter Martin]",-0.12688902007083824,Jed called and said he would rushed Amos to the hospital over the weekend because he had a bad toothache and I felt terrible I did not see this coming. By 3:00 he was still waiting to have three teeth out. Dr. Kritsick gave Jed the name of a doctor who works twenty-four hours. They said it was a bad case but I did not even notice anything was wrong. did not get out of the house until 4:00 and went over to church. Stuart picked me up and we went to the flea market but could not find any fleas. Then John Gruen and his wife Jane Wilson the painter were having a retirement party for Ulrik who is moving to an executive position at the New York City Ballet. Went over to the West Side to that (cab $4). Everybody was so friendly to each other it was like we are not part of this crowd. Heather said right in front of Peter Martins that she was so tired of seventeen years of waiting for him to give her a band. And Anne Bass is in Texas.

Went to church (cabs $4 $3). Went to the flea market on 76th Street and that one's indoors. Bought another Santa Claus sculpture. I just do not know what to paint. Fred does help me all the time getting ideas. He really does. But in the end ideas are actually just physically working it all out. you would think it is easy once you have an idea but it is not. it is just like writing. Like the Truman Capote play I wanted to do-if I would only looked at it at all before he died I would have followed him some more for three days and kept my mouth shut and really gotten something. So we walked around and people nudged each other when they saw us. Then went over to Jean Michel Basquiat's birthday lunch at Mortimer's that Marsha May from Texas was giving. And finally I gave Jean Michel Basquiat a gift he really loved-the rhythm and blues six-album set that Atlantic just put out. And Ahmet Ertegun wrote some of the songs those were his big years. Jean Michel Basquiat was reading the liner notes all through lunch. And then afterwards Jean Michel Basquiat wanted to go to Bloomingdale's it was 4:30. So we went over there. He wanted to get a $3000 gift certificate for his mother and when he took out his gold Amex card one guy asked to see ID but the other guy nudged him and said ""it is okay."""

So I peeked out and then made a dash for it. it is so funny to think that Matty was married to Genevieve Waite once. Are Genevieve and John Phillips still together? And I am trying to think has Matty ever had a job? No I do not think so. Except for a few months there in the sixties when he was a vice-president or something at Fox-when all those movie companies wanted the ""youth market"" so they were hiring freaks. I remember somebody there was always flying Matty back and forth from L.A. to New York	Oh I forgot he was in Bad. So that was a day's work. I forgot he was the cripple in the wheelchair.... So went to church came home started cleaning and got exactly one drawer done. Made carrot juice and made a big mess. Watched The Jewel in the Crown. Read an article from an L.A. newspaper on Ronnie Levin's murder. They have not found his body but they think this bunch of rich kids killed him and also killed the father of one of these kids-an Iranian- they found his body in the desert and they think Ronnie's is nearby. It was fascinating read it twice."

New York was so unbusy there were lots of cabs. Everybody must have gone away because it was great everything was open and nothing was crowded. Then cabbed to Union Square ($3). I got Rupert to come up and help me work I decided to do prints of the Ali paintings. Oh and in the morning I called David Whitney to wish him a Merry Christmas and Philip Johnson answered the phone and said he was cleaning up because the big winds had blown in a sheet of glass-he was at the Glass House in Connecticut-and it could have cut him in two. is not that scary? David was not there he was down at the greenhouse. Truman called and said he was alone because Bob MacBride had to spend Christmas with his kids. I worked all afternoon left at 5:00 dropped Vincent and Rupert ($4.50). Tom Cashin came over to the house for a fast turkey dinner before we went to Diane Von Furstenberg's. And Diane did not invite Bob Colacello to her party. Now everybody's saying that they only like me when Bob and Fred are not around with me that is the new thing. Everybody's being mean to Bob. But they will be turning on me soon too probably. But when we got to Diane Von Furstenberg's she had a guilty pang and started saying ""How could I be so evil? How could I be so rotten to Bob?"" and then she called him but he was already going to Adriana Jackson's but he said he would come after dinner. It was really raining when we were going over really hard. It was a horrible Christmas party with horrible people-about fifty of them-so I did not see why she could not have invited Bob in the first place. Barry Diller was there and I guess the reason he and Diane are a couple is because she gives him straightness and he gives her powerfulness. he is very powerful. And that producer Howard Rosenman was there and someone screamed ""Rosenwoman!"" and that was funny. Truman was having fun talking to Cappy Badrutt. She was the only fun person there. Then we left for Halston's. Catherine was there and I gave her a painting with some of my come on it but then Victor said it was his come and then we had a fight about that but now that I think about it it could have been Victor's. Halston had a big fish. I had red wine and was getting so tired that when Tom Sullivan put a crystal of coke on my tongue for the first time it really worked on me. Just one little piece and it really woke me up. We were going to Studio 54 and I knew that we would be up until 5:00."

Got not too many phone calls. Actually none I guess. Tried to wrap presents. I was going to have Peter and Chris over to plan our trip to Aspen the next day. I guess I took all day wrapping presents and I think by the time they came I would watched a lot of terrible TV. Went through a lot of fuzzy paper. Got a picture of Georgia O'Keeffe from Chris and a little painting from Peter and time really flew by. Nobody ate anything.

The rented house was just beautiful clean and with a picture window on the mountains. Jane Holzer called and she is not coming until after New Year's. My cold was starting up again it had completely gone away the day before. But at least I was not having an altitude problem. I was taking antihistamines and Aspergum and cough medicine. Peter made us mashed potatoes and salad for dinner. We watched Shampoo on TV then went to bed.

It was (laughs) a nobody interviewing three other nobodies. One said she was a friend of Milton Berle's and she was in every chorus of every movie you could ever think of. And then there was another one who was also in the choruses and she would say ""I played the Red Room of the Downstairs Club and the Blue Corner of the Uptown Spot"" things like that. It was so sad. Then she would say ""Show thepicture show the picture that is the one they are going to use when they use me...."" And there was a black girl who sang off key oh it was sad. And I finally saw Debbie Harry's video that was made in L.A. she is at the Beverly Hills pool and she did not wear the camouflage dress that we made for her the Stephen Sprouse thing. I guess the director did not want her to wear it and it would have been so good. My ambition if I were to really go and have a facelift and everything would be to come out like Debbie. Her song grows on you ""French Kissing."" I had leaking water and went into a closet and in it were the dresses I would bought at the Joan Crawford auction in 1977 and it turns out that the label on one says Nolan Miller! Can you believe it? The Dynasty designer! And now I do remember that at the auction I would said ""Whoever heard of this nobody?"" So now I would like to write to him and say I will sell it back to him for like $4000. we will find out what he sells a Joan Collins dress for and make it for that amount. The others do not have labels but they all look the same so I am sure they are all Nolans."

And one guy said he had a book jacket that I would done for a book called the Adventures of... somebody I forget. A New Directions book. It was the English edition of it and it did not have my name on it or anything and I know New Directions never paid me for an English edition of anything. It was a good all-over pattern of African masks and my mother's writing but they ruined it by making me draw a cutesy lady on it. For ""commercial appeal."" I had handed it in without it and then they told me to add this lady in. I do not know how he knew it was mine. Maybe he would seen the original American edition that had my name on it. And then we went to James Brown's studio near Katz's delicatessen and he lives on the third floor of a building and on the ground floor is a whorehouse and it would been raided three times that day and all these Puerto Rican ladies were running around in like (laughs) silk corsets and the madam looked sort of like Regine. And she had a guy assistant who was really good-looking like a fairy assistant. And these guys just go there I guess it is like eating. They do it just so they do not go crazy and they get off in five minutes and it is over. Like buying a lottery ticket. it is a renovated building and the madam had a hand-standing mirror in the hallway tilted to see who was coming. That reminded me so much of Billy Name-angled mirrors. Paige was fascinated with the whorehouse. She wanted to film it."

She did that to somebody else too that nice English guy who came all the way over here because he saw her picture and he beat her door down and there was nobody there then either. Halston and Stevie Rubell gave Bianca a beautiful fur coat. Dr. Giller paid for the collar and Halston and Steve paid for the rest of the coat. It cost $30000 or $40000. I am surprised they did not ask me to give her an arm. (laughs) And Halston said ""I think everyone should have furs jewels and Andy Warhol paintings."""

I talked to David Bourdon he was going to go to Rosenquist's New Year's Eve party. Rosenquist was hiring a live band again. It was so successful the year before that he is doing it again. I worked all afternoon at the office. It was nice working on New Year's Eve I painted backgrounds. Walter Steding came over to help me. Ronnie was having an Alcoholics Anonymous New Year's and Brigid stopped by to pick up some tapes. I did not know the evening at Halston's was going to be so chic my dear. I would asked if I could bring Jed and Halston said fine so we went over. Catherine brought Tom and Winnie-Halston'd said fine to that too. Tom told me that he was giving Catherine and me points in the movie and that they had to reshoot a little more that somebody had just given $150000 so they could. Bianca was in a Dior. Oh and Vincent called earlier and said that Mrs. Winters had called and said that Mr. Winters had what they think was a heart attack. Diana Ross looked beautiful. And she had asked Halston over the phone if he was going to serve black-eyed peas at midnight because it was good luck. So Steve went around town getting soul food. And when she got there Halston was cooking ham hocks and ribs. A few people said to her ""do not you want to check on the black-eyed peas?"" They knew the peas were her idea and they were just trying to be nice. I guess she took it as an insult though because she said ""No thank you darling I think I have checked them enough."" And Mohammed the houseboy had a girlfriend there and she was Jake LaMotta's daughter. he is that boxer Bobby De Niro's playing in the new Scorsese movie. she is pretty. While we were sitting at Halston's we had the radio on and it was ""live from Studio 54"" and we heard the announcer saying ""Oh yes! Here they come! Halston Bianca and Andy Warhol! they are walking in the door right now!"" Then we all did go to Studio 54. They had decorated it great put silver glitter on the floor and they had someone on a trapeze and white balloons. And they were saying that Bobby De Niro had been there since 10:00. they would been having a press party. The whole night was spent losing and finding and looking and finding and looking. John Fairchild Jr. has a crush on Bianca so we were looking for her and then losing her and then losing him and finding her and then losing me and looking for me and losing him.... I was sober. I had lots of Perrier. The place was still jumping at 7:00. Went outside it was warm out and people were still waiting to get in as if it were only 1:00. Only the light was different."

Got into black tie. Went over there and talked to David Whitney. The photographers wanted a picture of me and Bianca but she was being difficult. She was in a Calvin. Then we went in Steve Rubell's car to the Four Seasons. Shook hands with Jackie O. she never invited me to her Christmas party again so she is a creep. And now I would not go if she did. I would tell her to go mind her own business. I mean I am the same age so I can tell her off. Although I do feel like she is older than me. But then I feel like everybody's older than me. Philip was sort of cute. He said that it was not his exhibition it was his execution. David Whitney was having martinis and he said that as soon as Philip popped off he and I could get together. I laughed it off but later he said I had to kiss him on the lips. I really did not know he actually felt this way about me! I always thought he was kidding. And Philip gave a speech and David laughed and clapped. he is smart David. Bob Rauschenberg had me kiss him on the lips too. And then later a pretty girl groupie kissed me on the lips. So if I catch anything the Diary will know where it is from. I left Bianca there without saying goodbye (cab $7).

It looked like a stag party except for Arlene Francis and Peggy Cass and Dena Kaye who came instead of her husband Danny who had Concorde-lag and Irene Selznick who was the chairwoman of the evening or whatever they call it. Peggy and Arlene are Kitty's sidekicks from ""To Tell the Truth."" The dinner was to honor Kitty for being named the new head of the New York State Council on the Arts by Governor Carey. My doctor Doc Cox was there and he took me upstairs for a tour of Edwin Booth's bedroom and it was musty and dusty same as in the old days. Dinner was served and it was everything creamy I am not supposed to eat because of my gallbladder so the Doc was embarrassed that he was seeing me eat it because it was putting a damper on a social occasion so he told me ""I will not look."" Met Alfred Drake who was on Broadway that big handsome star of Carousel. Everyone made speeches and then Kitty got up and she was the best. She was wearing black and pearls looked very chic. She says she still wants to work a lot and I remember that Diana Vreeland once told me that Kitty had to ""work like a nigger"" because she does not have that much money. The Doc dropped me off."

And so I had one lifetime lens in and one overnight lens in and actually I saw very well. I picked up Jon and went to the Rainbow Room to get an award from The Best magazine (cab $7). It was jammed with TVs and cameras. Lost Jon in one second. Massimo Gargia the man who started The Best said that since I was so late to accept mine was the only blank award it did not have my name on it and I said that was perfect. The award was crystal and penis-shaped with a chain around it that looked like it was gold and I asked Ralph Destino the president of Cartier if it was gold-because it said ""Cartier"" on it-and he (laughs) said ""Think of it as gold."""

Joseph Papp had rented the building for the night-it was the Creo Society organizing a benefit for AIDS. Stuart thought it was black tie and then he was the only one in black tie so he looked like a waiter. There was an hour of cocktails first at Papp's place next door in the Public Theater and then they put up a plastic sidewalk for the people to get to Stuart's school and they had it done up so beautifully with flowers and food. I told Stuart to just look at what his dump could really look like. And the first people I saw were Anne Bass and Peter Martins and Jock Soto. And I stiffened because I would eaten so much garlic and I did not want to breathe on anybody. Leonard Bernstein was there and he cried. He always cries. he is such a weirdo. The Hamlisch guy played and Eileen Farrell was singing and Marilyn Home and Linda Ronstadt and a guy sang ""Ave Maria"" in be-bop or rap or rock and roll and it was like an Ed Sullivan Show. And there were no speeches because Liz Taylor did not show up. A New York Times reporter asked me what I thought of the performance and I said why did not these stars do this show on Broadway because most of them were out of work-that since there is no more Ed Sullivan we do not ever see them all anymore. And then Papp came over and he said oh no these people are much too big to work on Broadway that they just got together for this one special night. And I mean how can you be ""big"" if you are not working. And then Bernadette Peters was there with her tits hanging out of her dress and I had already said hello but Stuart wanted to meet her he insisted and so I interrupted her and he started talking and then his violining fingers started moving all over her and as much happened as she would let happen. And Stuart's standing there with so much tension he said to her ""Can I give you a ride?"" and she said ""No thanks darling I have my own car."""

And she said she finally is completely over Jean Michel Basquiat. It happened to her at the Comme des Garcons fashion show. She said he looked like a fool out there on the runway modeling the clothes and that is when she finally was over him. Bob Colacello was having a dinner for Sao Schlumberger at Mortimer's at 9:00. Got there when they were just starting to eat. I was next to an Indian lady named Gita Mehta and a Brazilian Portuguese woman who is married to an Irishman. And I was talking to Fred who'd been to the galleries and things with Twinkle Bayoud and her husband Bradley the day before and he told me I had to start getting new ideas to paint. He said Roy Lichtenstein's selling every painting that they all have red stickers on them and they are all $200000 or $300000.

He was waiting to take Fred and me to my first portrait job. We went to this small little house-it was like going into some Lower East Side house-and there was a mother and three children and Fred said one of them was really cute but I did not notice. They had corduroy pants on and torn shirts. Fred asked for orange juice and they gave him canned orange juice. The mother was just a little mother. The furniture was old and worn. There was not one thing in the place that looked rich. It looked so poor I just wanted to give them the portrait free. They were very nice but I just could not believe they could afford this. We were all stunned but Bruno was saying you can not tell about the Swiss the Swiss hide all their money.

After church cabbed to Mortimer's ($2). The place was jammed but I was the first person there for the lunch which was for Helene Rochas and Kim D'Estainville. Jerry Hall was there she was putting down Bianca now that Bianca is suing for half of what Mick's got. The case is in the California courts where all the live-in suits are going on now-like that is where the Hunt girl got support from Mick for the illegitimate kid. I told Mica we have to turn Ahmet gay so he will not be pinching all the girls. He really is funny-we were thinking of dumb ideas for musicals like jogging-Jogging.

Well listen I always thought it was stupid for him to change how he spelled his name and then not really change it-to just drop the ""i"" from ""Colaciello."" I mean if Bob expected me to spell it he should have made it a really simple name-something that I could spell."

They talked and laughed during the ceremony that was sort of good the bride and groom. But he is just another guy looking for a beautiful girl to get him into the papers. Cabbed back to pick up Chris to see Quest for Fire. And Rae Dawn Chong was in it the girl who was going with Owen Bayless who used to work for Interview. She was naked in the movie her role was that she teaches mankind how to fuck in the normal position instead of doing it from behind. The audience loved it. It was different. There was no dialogue.

Then she brought the new cat home and she heard a meow and opened the closet and there was Billy in a pail so she returned the new cat.

I watched Agnes of God three times and it was so boring. And I saw The Story of Will Rogers with Will Rogers Jr. and Jane Wyman and the son played his father.

The first car left we were in the second and we had a house number 36912 in Malibu. When we got there we could not find it but then the first car came along with Richard Weisman in it and he went to knock at 36910 because there was no 12 and the person who opened the door was ""Mary Hartman"" with her funny braids on. She said she would have a party for us if we could not find the party we were going to. But just then Coco Brown came by in another car with Wendy Stark and they said it was just down the block that Wendy'd got the number wrong. We got to the house and Bianca was there. she would had a fight with Mick and he would left that morning for New York-she would accused him of an affair with Linda Ronstadt. Walked down the beach with Bianca past the house of Larry Hagman and he was standing on the beach in a funny uniform like a foreign-legion outfit doing funny hand things and I guess he is gone off his rocker. While we were going by the sea came up and wet my shoes. Spent three hours trying to make dinner plans. Bob Ellis Diana Ross's ex and Alana Hamilton seemed too drunk Bianca did not want to be with Miranda because she was the sister of Sabrina Jed said he was hungry and he would eat anywhere and Wendy wanted us to go to Max Palevsky's because she thought it would be good for us-he was going to have us over to see his art collection.

I do not know I guess I will. Fred called and said the Hammer & Sickles went low. My prices were up until that de Menil auction and that brought them down. And Tony Shafrazi's show was bad for everyone. If he would only waited and done it this year. There was no rush and then it would have been that we would be still painting together. But then all shows are like that-you have a show and then it is over and you have used up all your material.

It turned out to be two hours of hits from Henry Mancini he opened the show so it was the Pink Panther and everything else and it was sooo boring and Paige was going ""is not this greeeaaat!"" she is got to get cooler I wanted to slap her out my nerves were jumping. Then Johnny Mathis came out and he is still got his voice. I never noticed that so much depends on how you hold the microphone. And then finally it was over but then he came back and did an encore.

Jane Holzer called and said she was in Washington with the guy who wrote Shampoo and Chinatown Robert Towne. His new movie Personal Best is about to come out it is about dyke athletes. They were coming up to New York later and she wanted to have dinner. And she said ""Bring your tape because he is so fascinating so fascinating."" I do not know what she was trying to do. At 10:20 I went to Elaine's (cab $4) and Elaine's fat again! So fat. After all she went through getting thin. Jane was already there with Robert Towne and they had the good table. For the first three hours I hated him. In fact I may still hate him I am not sure. He was just that California way. All those words that I hate like ""asshole"" and ""bimbo."" ""Bimbo"" drives me up a wall. He did not want to tape he said because he is been working so hard on ""my baby"" but he said ""If you want me to Jane I will do it."" His wife Julie was there and she gave up acting for real estate. she is good-looking but just almost at the stage where he will trade her in. Just almost over the hill. And we were there the whole time and Jane did not even tell me until she dropped me off that this was John Payne's daughter! I would have had a great time! Robert Towne talked about ""Warren"" a lot so I said I would just seen ""Jack"" in Aspen. Oh and in the beginning he quoted my line to me about ""in the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes"" only he said ""ten minutes"" and then it was funny because Mark Rydell the director came over fifteen minutes later and quoted me the same line and he said fifteen minutes and then he and Robert Towne argued over the time and I had to agree with Towne because I was with him. But what does this mean that they both quoted it? So then I asked him if he would like to buy the quote for a title and he said (laughs) ""No I like one-word titles best."" So then I told him I would sell him the title ""THE"" that Tennessee Williams once sold me. He laughed. I thought Jane was paying for dinner but then he did and I was embarrassed.

I watched Giant on TV from 1:00 to 5:30. it is so long. I even went to church in between and when I came back it was still on. James Dean's acting when he gets old is the worst thing. But they did a good thing-when he is drunk and talking into the microphone it is like a rock star he is right on top of the microphone and it is just noises coming out and so it is abstract. I had some wine and a couple of aspirin to try to get rid of the pain in my back. I am also trying to take two aspirin a day so I do not become senile because I just read that it stops the hardening of the arteries. But I do not know my mother took millions of aspirin and it did not do any good. Bob said the inauguration is on Saturday. I did not realize it was so soon.

Went to church then Paige called and said she would pick me up for the ballet (cab $5). The ballets were great. ""Symphony in C"" which I have not seen in years and then two Jerome Robbins ones. We had Peter Martins's seats. Jock and Heather were up there just flying around. And they said I could photograph the company for as long as I want so I am going to start that. Anne Bass was not at the ballet but she came to the dinner afterwards that Paige had arranged at Baton. And Paige and I are fighting. She keeps making these digs about Jean Michel Basquiat she said ""Are you starting up your gay affair again with Jean Michel Basquiat?"" and so I got my dig in and said ""Listen I would not go to bed with him because he is so dirty and I can not believe that anyone would. I mean you are the one who had the affair with a dirty unwashed person."" And then we had a fight about Eizo and shiatsu because her guy went on vacation so she is been using Eizo and she asked me if he ever did a thing on my stomach and she described how he would put his hands and was shaking it and she got nervous and took his hand away and so I said ""No but he told me how fat you are""-I was kidding-and so she said ""Okay that does it I am not using him anymore."" And then I tried to tell her he did not say she was fat but she would not believe me. And Peter Martins who commissioned me to do the ballet curtain he actually does have great ideas. I did not think so before but now I do. He talked to Stephen Sprouse about the Touch Tag thing where the kids who play football use clothes with Velcro so that instead of tackling and wearing shoulder pads they have to tear the Velcro off so they are working on the ""Fluorescent Orange"" ballet and then the kids thought of fluorescent snow. And when Ulrik told me he had not had time that night to walk his dog I used Heather's aggressive personality and I said ""Why did not you just put the dog on stage and have him do it there and no one would notice."" And I was telling everyone about my idea for a ""Shower"" ballet that I have always had-nude dancers getting into the shower after a heavy dance number and then shaking the water off on the audience. The ballet kids were quiet at first but after ten glasses of wine they were really funny. And Stephen Sprouse was showing how he writes backwards he is so clever and he had such beautiful writing. And then something really surreal happened. A busload of eight-year-olds came into this restaurant about fifty of them and filled it up at the bar and everyplace. And we asked them what they were doing there and they said they were going from bar to bar researching a school paper. It got really loud and noisy. They said they were going on to Nell's."

They were having them in the basement part of Trump Tower. It was the final tryout and I was supposed to be there at 12:00 but I took my time and went to church and finally moseyed over there around 2:00. This is because I still hate the Trumps because they never bought the paintings I did of the Trump Tower. So I got there and they were already up to the fiftieth girl and there were only twenty left to go. Another guy had been filling in for me and he handed me his pad and I took over. I did not know how to score. The girls did not look special because there was no spotlight on them. Once in a while a camera light would go off and flash on one and then she would look good but that was it. People like LeRoy Neiman were the other judges. He said he voted for anybody who could kick. Ivana voted for any of the girls who looked like her. And there were so many different kinds of bodies-some with big hips and small waists and some with boy-type bodies and some with really skinny legs so there were big spaces between their legs. And this cheerleading would be just something they would do ""for fun"" they do not get paid. So they would better get themselves a football player or they will walk away with nothing. And somebody told Ivana she would better watch her husband because she could lose him to these young girls but then later somebody told me that he fooled around with all the girls anyway. And seeing these young things and then a sophisticated ""lady"" like Ivana you would think that some day they could be like that too-if they marry right. And they all had to dance to ""Billie Jean"" by Michael Jackson so we all had to hear ""Billie Jean"" seventy times during the tryouts so it was sick. Went to Beulah Land on 10th Street and Avenue A (cab $6) to see the photography show of the kids at the office-Benjamin and Paige and Jennifer-and it was right near where I first lived when I came to New York on St. Mark's Place and Avenue A. And I thought about how hard it was then walking all that way home from the subway on Astor Place with my drawings and then dragging them up seven flights of stairs. And when we got to Beulah Land they said that I would just missed everybody's mother and father and relatives and I was so glad I had. Like Jennifer's mother and father and Paige's aunts and uncles. And Benjamin's photos were like my ideas-manhole covers that all looked the same but they were actually all different. And Benjamin is the only one who sold anything-Jeffrey Deitch from Citicorp bought them. And Paige has so much energy she did the Peter Beard look-writing little things-and it is almost there but how many things can you do with photographs? Stayed there an hour then went to the party at Pyramid for it. And it was the same crowd there. And these two clubs are the only places I have been to where the kids actually do dress the Fiorucci way-like wearing three dresses at once."

Got an outfit to give to Victor as a gift (hat $4 dress $26). Spent time looking for antiques but there are none in Kuwait-just a few old pots from a couple of years ago. We were the only foreigners in the marketplace. Went to Nadja's gallery. Had some more of the sweet funny coffee they offer you all the time you go crazy. We did not know that if you do not shake your cup they keep pouring it in. Bought five more copies of the Kuwait Times ($1). Calligraphy beautiful no Pop there. Went to different drugstores looking for A-200. To hotel. Ordered dinner before dinner (tip $2). The people we were having dinner with sent a silver Cadillac limousine. Arrived at Qutayba al Ghanin's a rich young Peter Brant type. His house was on the gulf a little out of town. Land there was really expensive. He made it chic by moving there. Kuwaitis do not serve hard liquor or beer or anything it is against the law but the rich ones have some hard liquor Jack Daniel's or something. Read Nick Carter. Really good-sex and girls.

Picked Fred up he was on time. Got to the airport (driver $60). Wore layers everything on my back. Got to Paris. A driver named Freddy picked us up. Checked into Hotel Lenox. Chris had the better room naturally what else is new? My room was freezing but it was cute. Small but cute. All that nice old kind of French wood. We walked on the ice to the Cafe Flore. Had some sandwiches and that was it. We were the only ones there we closed it ($35). Back at the hotel I fell asleep with all the lights on. Chris was smart he had two heaters sent up to his room.

Jo Jo Starbuck's husband is Terry Bradshaw of the Steelers and he got two touchdowns in fourteen seconds. she is the female star in the John Curry show. Then the Cowboys got two more. But the Steelers won. Then Tom Cashin and Jay Johnson came over and they were going to a movie but I did not want to go.

It was an exciting party. Jackie O. and Caroline were there. Caroline asked me what I thought of totalitarianism and I could not pronounce it so I tried to joke about it and she said ""No I am serious."" Mary Hemingway was there and Jonas Mekas filmed her being a lion attacking Peter Beard. Fred was there with Lacey Neuhaus and Stevie Rubell was there. Victor arrived in a torn T-shirt with spurs on his arms with a present for Peter-it was something that looked like he might have found in the street or maybe used in Halston's display window like a part of a machine. And he had a present for me too-a used jockstrap. It was great. Barbara Allen was there with Philip Niarchos he is in town. Ronnie and Gigi and Walter Steding were also there and Jennifer Jakobson who does not seem to be with Francois de Menil anymore. And Steve Aronson. he is a real charmer he speaks so beautifully and wears those great clothes. Peter was very happy because all of his old girlfriends were in one room. Then we all went over to Studio 54 and they had an elephant cake for Peter come down from the ceiling because Peter took all those great African elephant pictures. Arnold Schwarzenegger was there. I left around 2:00 just as Halston and Bianca were coming in. They were both in elephant masks but the photographers did not care they are tired of Bianca. She better get out of town for a while."

Went to Schiaparelli's show (cab $3). They gave us a good seat and lots of attention. The show was awful based on ""The Three Graces"" by Botticelli. One dress was worth $2 million or something and the best thing was the armed guards around it."

She really goes out of her way and she is got so much energy she is like Chris except that Chris only does it for himself and Paige does it for other people. I can see why she gets upset when things happen because she puts so much into other people. And Mrs. Aquino's being so grand in the Philippines smiling away and her guards killed thirteen people at the palace. Why did not they shoot over their heads? Or use tear gas. It makes you think that Communists did it to other Communists just to start trouble. Or something. It was Superbowl Sunday and seeing the people in the stands football games are really the best places to meet macho guys. If Paige wants to meet men and get married she should be going to football games not to the ballet! Go bowling in Brooklyn-Manhattan is too sophisticated. Then there were tickets put aside for me at the Joyce Theater where Robert LaFosse was doing a guest appearance in Karole Armitage's ballet. This is the thing that her boyfriend David Salle did the costumes for he is the artistic director. And then Paige had arranged dinner at Indochine with the New York City Ballet people to talk about the curtain they want me to design. That was at 9:45 or 10:00. The phone kept ringing and my stomach was a mess I should not have eaten the dessert Paige brought. Kenny Scharf called trying to get me to buy land in Brazil and I would been ready to send him a check but then Fred had screamed at me about it while we were in Europe. He was insisting that it is just black-market sales and you do not have a contract or really proof that you own it. But it is so cheap. And Paige wanted to go in on it with me and she was going to go down for a week and check it out. You get (laughs) your own coconut tree. But they say there are too many killings there and that they could just take the land away from you at any time. But gee it is so cheap. Stuart and I went to Sotheby's and it was packed they had Americana. Jamie Wyeth was there but not Phyllis and he looks older he is lost his boyish charm he is grander. Then I felt worse so I went to the drugstore and got some Maalox. And Peter Wise called up I knew he would call because I heard he wants a job with Stuart Pivar. But ever since that time he would not accept my word over Kent Klineman's I just think he is stupid....did not I ever tell the Diary about this? About the big fight I had with Peter? I mean here I would been good friends with him for six years and I am telling him a fact and suddenly he was saying ""Well that is not what Kent says"" and I said ""Well if 1 say something's red and you can see that it is not you should still believe me because we are friends."" So I told him that if he did not want to believe me he should just ask Fred and he did and it turned out I was right but he had not believed me alone and that made me so mad I just thought it was so awful. And when he called yesterday we never got around to talking about the job he wants to get working for Stuart but I know that is what he wanted. And now somehow I have hired Chris's friend Ken to pick me up in the mornings he is going to be my new bodyguard. he is a really good-looking tall blond kid. The one from Florida. So then I went over to the Joyce Theater and Tama met us there she came in from Princeton (tickets $40). The production was stinkeroo but Robert LaFosse is really professional. Then after the ballet I could not face dinner at Indochine so I just went to a fruit stand and I got a pineapple and bananas and apples and I went home. The driver asked me for an autograph so I had to tip big (cab $9). And then I made juices out of the stuff and by the time I was done it had taken so long I could have gone to the dinner-after squeezing everything and washing out the juicer. Took a sleeping pill and slept all night. Woke up at 6:00."
"Sunday, January 26, 1986",[],0.07619047619047618,Went to the flea market and it was raining. Then went over to the East Side to the armory show. At Sotheby's they would just sold a table for $1.2 million. A record. And at the armory there were all these people that I used to buy junk from for $35 and if I would only bought the $100 stuff that stuff would be worth a lot now but I bought the cheap stuff. And now what people want is only one of a kind. My art is just the opposite.

Fred called and invited me to mix with the Kennedys at his place at 10:00 before the Studio 54 party for Pilar Crespi. And Tom Cashin came by to take me to a models party but I was too worn out. I saw a little of Taxi Driver on TV and the guy at the end reading the letter from Pittsburgh really sounded like he was (laughs) reading from Pittsburgh. Oh and on the news the lady who hijacked the plane said she had nitroglycerin and wanted Charlton Heston and Wonder Woman to read her letter on TV? She looked like a normal schoolteacher ... she was from California. There were some famous people on that flight-the Jackson 5's father and the guy who was with Mary Martin in Sound of Music on Broadway.

She told me that it is really getting to her that Philip and Manuela are around. Everybody's calling Barbara and saying ""we are inviting Philip and Manuela-do you still want to be invited?"" she is unhappy. At 8:30 I went over to Halston's. Bianca was wandering around with her tits showing. Mark Shand's left town. We cabbed up to the Iranian embassy ($2.50). Maximilian Schell was there and he would gotten a supporting role award for Julia. I had never met him before and I was disappointed that he was fat but he was really sweet. He said that I did great things for him in Germany that he would seen Flesh and hated it and then gone back to see it again and again and loved it and that he thought If this is a movie then I can make a movie too. I did not know what to say so I decided to give him Bianca and they went crazy over each other from then on. I would always heard he was a fag but the way they were carrying on that image was fading. And Sissy Spacek introduced me to her husband he was very nice and Bella Abzug's campaigner-what is her name? Shirley MacLaine told me she had the picture I did of Bella on her bureau. And John Simon was there he was intrigued by Bianca. She had her hair in big pincurls that she said was a Nicaraguan style but it looked Puerto Rican. S.J. Perelman was there and I wanted to talk to him because Nelson always said he is the funniest man in the world but I did not. Bianca came running over and told me that for the first time she would fallen for an older man. She said she had to leave that she had to go home and cook a dinner for Halston and I guess I laughed out loud because I remembered when Amanda Lear told me that the reason Mick's left Bianca is that she never made him a meal. When she is after somebody though she is a real coquette out to prove she can do all the things. So we went back to Halston's. Maximilian let his car go I guess he was cheap. Stevie called and said come to the club. Victor and I had a feast in the kitchen-we made popcorn and I had orange juice and vodka. We left Bianca and Maximilian hugging and kissing in the other room. Halston took Linda and went to bed. Then we went over to Studio 54 and it was jumping."

The tour organizer took Catherine and me around the Fine Arts Center at Cheekwood. We tried to grab hot dogs we were so hungry but he whisked us away. There was a staircase there brought from England. The popcorn machine was at the top of it and Catherine and I went to get some we were eating and talking and we noticed that the stairs were lined with people and then we realized that they were lined up because they thought it was a receiving line to meet me because they saw me at the top. We filled up some bags with popcorn and tried to get out but then someone asked for some and I gave them a bag and then I wound up giving autographs for an hour and a half. Then dinner was served. A few of the locals came and Don Johnson that cute actor we know from Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart he is a friend of Phil Walden's. Suzie Frankfurt came down to Nashville to social-climb. she would pre-written thank-you notes before she even got there and she made out well she got on the front page with me instead of Catherine who did not step forward fast enough.

And Heather said that she always thought Stephen was passive but that since he is started doing ballet costumes she is changed her mind. Everybody else always gave her what she wanted she said but when Stephen gave her her dress and she said ""Oh I do not want this"" he told her ""you are going to get what I say you get."" So she liked that and now she wants to marry him. So that is another girl who is after him. Heather paid."

As I was leaving the house John Curry called to thank me for the Shadow painting I sent him. Went to Elaine's to have dinner with Phyllis Diller (cab $2.50). Barry Landau arranged it so he was there. Phyllis was cute she is a happy divorcee. Right as I was talking to Phyllis she finally realized that I was the person who'd asked if I could draw her foot in around 1958. She was just starting out then-it may have been at the Bon Soir or someplace and all these years she never put it together that that was me and this is me and so she said ""Oh you are the foot fetishist!"" Phyllis did not eat much. Tommy Smothers was with us and so was Tommy Tune. He said that Elaine's had the best food he would had in so long and everybody looked at him like he was nuts. He must be. Then Adolph Green started coming toward the table with his arms out so (laughs) Barry Landau whispered to Phyllis quickly that she had just sent a bottle of champagne over to him. Because Barry had sent a bottle and signed it from her. And Tommy Smothers was tongue-kissing Phyllis and so I said ""If you can tongue-kiss her you can tongue-kiss me."" So he gave me a quarter of a tongue-kiss and said he would give the rest when he knew me better. Then we went to Studio 54 and it was very empty. John Fairchild Jr. was there and he asked to borrow money so I ripped a hundred-dollar bill in half and that upset him but it was a memorable moment. And I did not realize it at the time that he probably had his coat on only because he did not have enough money to check it. And Halston is funny-no matter how many times we run into each other on the floor he grabs me and hugs me and kisses me and says ""it is so nice to meet you Mr. Warhol."" Paid John Fairchild Jr. for bodyguarding me ($20)."

Bianca just wants all the attention for herself. The match was Connors against Borg. Connors won. I read The New York Times at Halston's he was at the office. Someone called Bianca and she was on the phone for an hour talking about her problems and I wished I would listened or taped but I was just reading. For the first half-hour she was talking about someone who she said was using her in London just to get their picture in the papers-she is so funny because that is all she ever wants herself-and then the other half-hour she was talking about what a stupid blonde Jerry Hall is. I think she is really worried that she is getting her permanent walking papers from Mick. While Bianca was on the phone Jade asked me for candy and I gave her some M&Ms and then she said ""you have got to give me my supply for the night."" So I gave her a few and she said ""you have got to give me some more we will go to the bathroom"" and I told her that her mother would think it was strange if we went all the way to an upstairs bathroom and she said ""Well come under the stairs then."" I slipped the M&Ms to her and she took them like drugs."

She was with a girlfriend a writer who is working on a series. Julia said they were going to meet Barbara Feldon at Serendipity so went to the Sherry to pick them up. Julia was driving me crazy sometimes when I would catch her eye she looked just like Valerie Solanis and then she also acts like Viva. She got it in her head that I ""saved"" her the night of New York New York. She said that she was not next to Martin at the table and I went over and sat her down there and that that squelched rumors that her husband was having an affair with Liza Minnelli so the papers did not get it. She went on about that a lot and she was walking sort of drunkenly on blue high heels and her pupils were dilated. When we got to Serendipity Barbara Feldon was there. Julia started doing what I hate more than anything patting my head all the time. She drove me crazy. And she kept trying to fix me up with her girlfriend who was tall and kind of pretty and it was them saying ""you are so wonderful wonderful wonderful"" to me for hours and I did not know what to do. Since I told her they did not have liquor she brought champagne. I do not understand these girls they talk and say things and I do not know what they are doing. Barbara left and we cabbed to Elaine's. We ordered and it was more ""are not you wonderful""s. Julia said she wanted to set up a date for me to meet the writer of Annie she said it would be nice for me to meet some real men and I did not know what that meant if she was saying ""real men"" and the real men meant fairies or what she was talking about. Julia told me how they do things on Marty's movies-they rehearse the people do videotapes then Julia picks out the best things and they have the people redo them that way on camera later during the shooting. She said they change the plot and twist it during the shooting. Like in the original story of New York New York Bobby De Niro goes into the record business. She said that Marty has coke problems and he got blood poisoning and now he takes medicine to clean himself out. he is cutting three movies now. She said she wrote a lot of Taxi Driver. I started saying people act like it is the directors and the producers and the writers who make a movie when it is actually the stars and she took offense saying her husband had created Bobby De Niro and Harvey Keitel and some other people. But I said they were new faces and people always want to see new faces. Marty is now in Chicago doing a musical called Shine It On with Liza. She said that she gave Robert Altman the idea to film A Wedding in Chicago to take it out of L.A. and give it a different atmosphere. The producers gave her three days off she said so I took that to mean she must have been driving them crazy. Julia was getting a little too drunk. She dumped her pocketbook on the table and all the credit cards spilled out. She went to the bathroom and I put them back in (dinner $70)."

His mother died when he was nineteen....""I said ""Uh Chris your mother's still alive."" And he said that when they were doing around-the-world the kid said ""Whatever happened to Chris and Byron?"" Like whatever happened to those sweet kids. So there they were engaged in this salacious scene saying what happened to their innocence. Oh I guess ""Byron"" would be too much. (laughs) it is actually Brian. But it feels like Byron. Talked to John Reinhold. Stayed home and moped because I am sick in the head. Too afraid to even walk the dogs because I do not want to bend over on the streets and pick up the poop. So now I send them just out to the backyard. Jed did not take them this weekend."

Brigid called me she would just gotten out of the hospital. She has gallstones the size of grapenuts. She said they want to operate. I told her that they always want to operate that it is like doing portraits you do not care who you do as long as you have someone to do. Because that is where they make their bucks. I told her to ask the doctor for painkilling stuff but she said she already did and they would not give it to her they said they needed to know if she had pain so when she started having it they could give her the operation. I think she should get it in September unless it is really hurting her. Life is just too hard. Called Rupert. Then I got the book of my old paintings out and saw all the clever things I used to do and I just can not think of anything clever to do now. Maybe I should do Soup Cans again. Then Chris Makos called and said Schnabel was big that abstract expressionism was coming back. And he said that he would bring a can over for me-Campbell's Won Ton soup that has the oriental lettering. Called Jon and nobody answered. Saw a wonderful movie on TV Coal Miner's Daughter and I wished I taped it. Oh I wish I was married to a husband like that! Oh he is so cute so wonderful.

I would been reading the biography of Cecil Beaton. I am in it a lot when I knew him. And Sam Green was in everybody's life such a big part-he is had Yoko Ono and John Lennon and Cecil Beaton and Greta Garbo and me. We got lots of work sold a lot of paintings in London-one to Carnegie-Mellon-and Anthony d'Offay even said he would pay for Chris's hotel bill which he will die over when he sees that Chris made eighteen phone calls a day to New York. And Chris got five jobs over there-one from Polaroid-and he actually thanked me for the trip. I only wish I could think of a more deserving person to give these opportunities to. But in his own way Chris does take care of me. The show. The show. I mean walking into a room full of the worst pictures you have ever seen of yourself what can you say what can you do? But they are not the ones I picked. D'Offay ""art-directed"" the whole show-he would tell me he wanted a certain picture and then I would think he would never remember so I would do the one I liked instead and when he would come back to New York he would say that that was not the one he would picked. And he did not want the big camouflage he wanted the little ones. But he had class he arrived at the hotel with his wife at 7:30 in the morning to say goodbye. I thought they were going to ride with us to the airport but they did not so that was good. His hotel bill for us will be about $10000 I think. Yeah he was nice. Oh and God Billy Boy turned out to be a nightmare! By the end of the trip everybody hated him. It was worse social climbing than anything Suzie Frankfurt ever did and as Fred said at least Suzie was always an old friend. Everyone we would introduce him to he would have their phone number in a minute and be inviting them to lunch and giving them his earrings and everything! I mean he was on my TV show for hours! One they did on me. And he was popping into every picture and one photographer told him to get out of it and Billy actually hit the guy (laughs) with his own camera. And I would be up so late reading like to 5 A.M. and then I would get calls early in the morning-""Is Billy Boy there?"" he would tell people he could be reached in my room for breakfast! He did bring me flowers one morning though. he is like a more together Jackie Curtis. And Chris really hates him now too. They had a big fight because when we ran into Gloria Thurn und Taxis and her husband at Heaven Billy was so sweet to them but after they left he said ""I hate those fascists"" and Chris got mad at him. I guess Billy Boy felt he should have been invited to their party or something. Tried to make phone calls but my hands could hardly move. Fred said that all the chic people were in Europe that they would skipped the Statue of Liberty thing. Like Jerry Zipkin and Ahmet. How would that happen? Do they call up Nancy Reagan and ask her ""Will the Statue thing be any good?"" and she says ""No""?"

It was Nastase vs. Vitas Gerulaitis. I was for Vitas and he did win. Then Barbara and Bob called and said that Vitas was having a dinner for everyone out at the River Cafe in Brooklyn on the barge and they talked me into going. They said they were coming to pick me up. At 10:00 they did. Barbara was showing us the ring Nastase gave her. Then Nastase came in with a beautiful girl a model and Barbara went upstairs and cried. And then Richard Weisman was saying how silly Barbara was to be upset when she knew Nastase was married with kids and everything anyway. Truman said he had a really rich guy for Barbara and that she would have three planes and all the money in the world and a house in Mexico and that cheered her up. We were there until 2:00. Vitas paid. He said he would just been in London and while he was in a club talking to Ringo Starr Stevie Rubell kept pulling on his arm and saying ""Come on Vitas we have to go Bianca wants to leave"" and Ringo said ""who is the little midget you are taking orders from now?"" Vitas said Stevie's really insecure when he is not in his own club.

He said that by Wednesday he would be out of the hospital-he is there for a blood check-and that we should have lunch."

So I was embarrassed. Ran into the doctor and his family who live next door. And they had a wheelchair with a cake in it and they said that the daughter was getting married at 4:00. And the cake looked beautiful. it would been made three days before out of marzipan so it was turning yellow but it was great. I got a picture for the Party book.

Catherine really is on Easy Street. It was so beautiful. Drue Heinz and her husband were there. And Guy Nevill's parents. About thirty-five people for lunch. Then Halston Steve Victor and Randy. Catherine's stepfather Paul Channon he is a minister in Mrs. Thatcher's government. he is a Guinness too but an even richer Guinness than Catherine's father. I sat next to Catherine's mother Ingrid and Halston sat on her other side and Victor sat nearby. Really fun lots of wine got really drunk. Halston had to get back to London to Martha's rehearsals. Victor went back too. Catherine gave me a tour. Beautiful. Steve played tennis and he plays really good. After you see how rich Catherine is it seems so silly that she should ever have had a dump in New York and worked at a regular job. It was wonderful they showed us a good time people were all so friendly. Lost my contact lens and Catherine helped me find it. It was lying on the sink I was putting it in and it fell.
"Sunday, July 22, 1984",[],-0.00019480519480519605,"-Aspen-New York Benjamin showed me that his seat on the plane converted into a toilet-if you had to go to the bathroom you would have to ask him to get up and then a curtain would come around you. So that scared me into not drinking anything on the flight-you would have had to say ""Excuse me but I would like to use your seat for a toilet."" But Vitas had about six sodas and still he did not have to use it. So anyway this small plane had to add fuel in Denver because a load big enough to get us to New York would have been too heavy to get us over the mountains it is a regulation. And then we stopped in Pittsburgh for a minute (candy $3). There were six seats plus the toilet seat that Benjamin sat on. Got to New York."

Watched the death of the Shah on TV all day on the all-day cable news channel. I did not know that one of the Shah's sisters had a house built by I.M. Pei in Tehran they showed it and it was really beautiful with a dining room. I wonder who she gave dinners for. The palace that we were in was just a dump.

And I talked to Henry Post. His leg's still in a cast but the car insurance company got him a nurse to type for him that is what they do. We talked about John Berendt getting fired from New York-Henry said he knew it was coming because they hired a girl three weeks before they fired him. Henry says there is a list of people who bought drugs at Studio 54 that that is what the prosecution is following. Curley called and wanted to go to dinner but I was too tired and exhausted still."

Went to church. Then was picked up by Jon he had a car and we went out to the Brants' big spread in Greenwich. Jed decorated the house and everything and it was my first time seeing it. Rolling hills and white columns. it is impressive. Peter's so into polo and horses still. It was a lot of polo players at the place. I was underdressed because Sandy told me it would be all right to just come like that and then I felt crummy especially when I saw Jed was there. Fred came with Averil and her husband and it was his birthday. I saw a couch that was a copy of the one that I have on my first floor and they would had it done for $2000 and I told them that they could get one that was the real thing from the Roosevelt estate for $85000. They have one of my paintings in every room. And Peter had paid I think $500000 for a new Jasper Johns that did not look like a Johns it is his new stuff it looks like an illustration. Barbara Allen was there with the Polish guy Kwiatkowski and he does have capped teeth. I mean she could have just had Joe Allen's teeth capped if that is what she wanted. I do not get it. And Joe Allen was there with his new wife Rhonda. They had a dance band that played during dinner and everybody danced. PH was with Jed. And I went into the big room where they had a Marilyn over the mantle in a gold frame and it looked just beautiful. Really beautiful. It looked like a million-dollar painting. It looked so right in that room with all the America stuff. I wish I would painted better in those days though. The painting on it-it is not painted too well. I did not know how then. And they had my Merce Cunningham in the same room where the Jasper Johns was. And they had my Mona Lisa on the way up to the stairs. I tried to take Jon back to see the Marilyn but then there were Glorious Food waiters telling people not to go into the rooms.

Walked over to Victor's-at-Halston's. I ran into Stevie of Studio 54 on the street. Victor was trying to call his big black number again. Halston came in just as I was leaving and that was awkward really awkward. Victor is my new Ondine he even uses a TWA flight bag like Ondine used to. But it is getting kind of too heavy seeing him so much. He should get his art career going but he thinks he does not have to have sex with somebody to get ahead. I told him ""you have got to fuck your way to the top."" Then I told him the Barbara Rose/Frank Stella Story. Some blacks recognized me a few times this weekend and I am trying to figure out what they recognize so I can somehow sell it to them whatever it is."

Opened up worked all afternoon. Called Earl McGrath and asked if I could bring Jay to dinner. Cabbed to West 57th Street ($8). It was very air-conditioned at Earl's. Camilla makes great food a good Italian cook. Annie Leibovitz was there and she said Jann Wenner's mad at her because she accepted a year's contract with Vanity Fair and he said she could not work for Rolling Stone and Vanity Fair too. Then everybody had to read poetry and that was the funniest thing. I did not but everybody else did. They took them off the bookshelves. Really it was so sick. Earl's such a camp. I was laughing everybody was. But reading straight. Like Jerry Hall reading straight like ""I am so-and-so king of kings/Look at me and despair."""

I think he maybe spent everything he had on Cocaine Cowboys. I mean if he only had a couple of million it would not have lasted him long the way he was living so high on the hog traveling every minute. I glued myself and went to Mt. Sinai to visit Sandy Brant who is expecting triplets 101st and Fifth. Cabbed ($3) up Madison and it seems like they are reclaiming some of the blocks as white. they are putting up tall buildings and the whites are slowly moving uptown. they are selling apartments there for a couple of hundred thousand now. We were not going to tell Sandy about the fire at their stable in Greenwich that destroyed the stable and nine horses but she told us about it. They think it might have been set. there is a guard there twenty-four hours a day now. They did not have a sprinkler system. We were there about forty-five minutes till 9:00. Then worked at home. No phone calls. I watched the all-day news on Ted Turner's station. The weather changed and was cool and windy and beautiful my hair was flying all over. Fred went out to Manhasset with the Paysons for a big house party that Averil was giving for the Fourth of July weekend at Greentree.

Plaza took eight tapes with me and a camera (cab $2). I talked to Bob MacBride for a while and then Truman made a phone call to Jack Dunphy so I could tape it. Jack was his boyfriend for thirty years. But he had not seen the article in the Times yet so he did not have any comments. Truman also told me he would talked to Gerald Clarke the guy who is been writing the book on him for something like five years and Clarke wanted to know how the girl who wrote the article got Jack Dunphy in it when he could not and Truman said it was because she would run into him on the beach it was an accident. Truman said Clarke called him but I think Truman probably called Clarke. Anyway if Clarke did call him then his phone was not off the hook so either way he was lying. Then we went over to Antolotti's and got pizza. And the drinks there with the vodka and grapefruit juice really do put weight on you I have noticed. I was getting drunk. Then I walked him home I had Truman on my arm. it is funnier to see Bob MacBride walk him home on his arm- that is really creepy. But when I walk him on mine it is creepy too. And he is weaving and he is so strong he was pushing me over. Went home (cab $3). Got three full-sided tapes out of the evening.

Pepe Balderago was with him there and confirmed that he absolutely flipped out and ""realized he was God"" and left. So when I went downstairs at New York/New York and I saw him I said ""Hi God"" and he called me a genius for knowing. And it is true he actually does think he is God. So I walked with Pepe Balderago and God over to Studio 54. I talked with God as we walked. When we got to Studio 54 I saw John and told him that God was on the dance floor and he ran away."

I decided I will not sign the fake ones that're turning up all over Europe-the ones the people told us they bought from Gerard. Maybe I should do new ones and make good on the fakes in Europe. I do not know I will see. I dropped Rupert (cab $3.50) and stayed home. And I forgot to say that last week when Jed and I were walking on Madison we ran into Dustin Hoffman in his beard with his little girl. He was carrying lots of record albums from the house that he and his wife Anne live in behind the Cerfs' house carrying them up to 75th Street. I did not know then that he was leaving home which I just read in the paper.

Decided to go on the Safari Trail ride and ran into Ron Galella who was there with his wife who'd also never been. Then Ron gave us a ride to the Grand Concourse and we got- a subway ($1.50). The subway made a lot of stops at first but then it was express. Got off at Columbus Circle and walked home. The day had been mostly black. Originally the city was having Puerto Rican Day so that was one of the main reasons to get away. But P.R. Day was 98.9 percent black. The subway was 85 percent black. The zoo was 80 percent black the park was 99.5 percent black. Whites are really a minority.
"Sunday, June 13, 1982",[Candy Darling],0.2765625,Watched Dog Day Afternoon on TV and who was that playing the drag queen? That was good acting. He held his hand up a little too much to his neck that was all. Otherwise it was really perfect and good lines one was like a Candy Darling line.

Went home and watched the thing they did on me on MTV. They showed Heat and a little of Kiss. Don Munroe talked and they had clips of the ""Hello Again"" video we did for the Cars. And I talked and I was okay. I tried sleeping without a Valium but the wine I would drunk at dinner drove me insane. Valium's the perfect drug for me."

Then we walked around the Village. In the old days you could go over there on a Sunday and nobody would be around but now it is gay gay gay as far as the eye can see-dykes and leather bars with the names right out there in broad daylight-the Ramrod-type places. These leather guys they get dressed up in leather and go to those bars and it is all show business-they tie them up and that takes an hour. They say a few dirty words and that takes another hour. They take out a whip and that takes another hour-it is a performance. And then every once in a while you get a nut who takes it seriously and does it for real and it throws it all off. But it is just show business with most of them. Dropped Victor off ($5) stayed home and watched TV. Thought about the whole Scorsese scene. they are riding high they are really riding high.
"Sunday, June 19, 1983",[],-0.26461805555555556,Victor called and I am just afraid that drugs have taken over Victor's brain because you know you are emotional and then you take all the drugs and do all the fighting and then suddenly it happens-you are over the brink. I am afraid he is having a nervous breakdown. He said he was in a hospital and had all these stitches and bruises and it was too crazy. And he said that the night before the air conditioner had broken at Halston's but I was not sure if it had really broken or if Halston had just wanted to drive him out. I guess it really must have been broken though because Halston would not have wanted the orchids to die and they were dying. And I have been thinking about these people who sell things on the street because I watched on TV and this newscaster was just beaming doing this story about how the city confiscated $485000 in street vendors' merchandise. But I mean there were these black people out there working trying to actually sell and now they will just start stealing! I mean vendors are messy and dirty and they slop up the streets but they are trying to do workl And here they are beaming on TV that they put them out of business. And they have the store owners on saying they pay big rents and it is not fair but I mean do the stores sell the same stuff as the people on the streets? Not really.

They all have mustaches alligator T-shirts bluejeans or the other look is leather pants and jackets and sunglasses. Barbara Allen called for who was around and available for what. I told her Thomas Amman was in town and so she called him and got invited to dinner. Cabbed to Mr. Chow's ($4). We were kind of late and Thomas was mad at us. Ran into Rita Lachman on the way in with her ghostwriter for The Rita Lachman Story. They sat next to us. Alan Wanzenberg the architect and Stephen Webster the lawyer were there and Barbara and Fred and Jed and some other girl. Barbara sat next to me and I kept telling her to bring Bill Paley down for a portrait. Then I happened to mention that Truman said he was writing a piece on Babe Paley and then Barbara said she wanted to read it to make sure that it would not offend Mr. Paley. she is so ridiculous. She said Mr. Paley gave her something something really great but she would not say what-she had each of us confess something and after we did she still would not tell us. She had a whole bottle of sake to herself. She said she is madly in love with Mr. Paley that he is the only man she loves.

Bought makeup at Patricia Field's (makeup $28.70 cab $7.50). Got Japanese red. But I like that stuff at Fiorucci that just is a stain that gives your lips like a natural brown. Because my lips used to be so full and now they are not they have just disappeared and where did they go? We went and watched the Gay Day parade. The Gay Cops and me got the biggest clap and (laughs) I took photos. Got film (film $6.90 lunch $60). And they had the contingents of Gay Docs and Dykes the groups from Oklahoma City and Virginia. And the Men & Youth organization. So sick. The float that got the most attention was the S&M float where the big guys were in leather with the keys and everything. All the beauties must have been shopping in Soho or out on Fire Island 'because they sure were not in this parade. And there were guys in wheelchairs being pushed by their lovers. I am serious! It looked like Halloween but without the costumes. And they had a Kate Smith record playing.

We talked a while and he was fishing for an invitation so I invited him over for lunch. Peter Beard came over with Margrit Ramme who was kissing Peter in front of Barbara Allen his old girlfriend but the two girls got along okay. Dick Cavett told a Polish joke-put dots on his hands and then put his hand by his ear- ""what are you doing?"" ""Listening to the Ink Spots."" And then Margrit told one about the Polish police lineup where the guy rapist steps out of the line and says ""that is the girl!"" Barbara was upset because Jack Nicholson gave the part she ""auditioned"" for to an unknown girl who did some New York theater things. I left early with Francois. he is a good fast driver-got us from Montauk to East Hampton in ten minutes. Jann Wenner had John Belushi at his place. Jann gave us a tour of the house. If he would rented Montauk he could have had something great but I guess he and his wife Jane just wanted something ""adorable."" I was thinking about an idea all weekend that I got from the Liz and Dick book about doing a love affair between two parallel streets that can never meet. Dylan Thomas had once told Richard Burton he wanted to do that but then he died. It would be a good thing for me to do a good art idea. Philip Niarchos kept calling Barbara from his car all weekend from London. He went to a big ball there all the rich kids were at it."

And if I ever saw this as a script I would not know what to think. And they say these lines seriously it is all done like it is real problems.

She had a nose job and everything so she has that out-of-town look but she has a great young body. But then I do not know if her body is pulled together by bras and things. You never know. She asked me about the rest of the old gang. There were millions of girls in the Gay Day parade. Stuart called and said Mario Amaya died of AIDS and he was so upset about it and I tried to make it light and he was just so upset saying Mario was the most important person in his life and that he would taught him everything about art. And I said ""But Stuart you are not gay why are you so upset?""

Liza was there with Halston and she won for Best Singer in a Musical and when they called her name Stevie Rubell jumped out of his seat next to Halston. Liza was running against Eartha Kitt in Timbuktu and Madeline Kahn in Twentieth Century. Catherine called and said that Steve Aronson came over to her house the night before-the lady he was going to visit in Southampton would not let him bring his big dog so he did not go at all-so he and Catherine were both depressed together. Catherine is in love with Tom but does not want to go out to Montauk and be a maid and Tom does not want to be serious and she once told me that she would never get serious about it but she is so she was depressed. And Margaret Trudeau's run off with Jack Nicholson or something. And we are upset if there was a party for Liza and we were not invited. Yeah I am sure there was.
"Sunday, June 5, 1977",[Louis Malle],-0.020346320346320335,-New York Made lots of calls around town catching up. Vincent was in Montauk showing Louis Malle the place hoping for a rental. we are trying to rent the main house for $4000 a month during July and August-$26000 for six months. Two thousand a month for the small cottages but we will deal. Mr. Winters wears his Bad T-shirt and his Rolling Stones denim jacket while he takes care of the place. He needs a new Jeep-he has a door hinge for an accelerator pedal. He handed Vincent a magazine clipping that said I buy a new car for myself every year to help make his case for a new Jeep.

Brooke was sweet her mother thanked me for coming. The usual people were there Cornelia with her beau. Couri Hay and Scavullo and Sean Byrnes. And Ted Kennedy Jr. came and said hello. Brooke ate with us and it is just so funny to see her with her little girlfriends because here's this 6' goddess and then these short little ducklings who're smart-I mean they are smarter than Brooke but it is just like two such different things. She looks twenty-five. If she could only get her voice down to sounding less feminine she could really make it in the movies. And Brooke thanked me for the present of putting her on the cover oi Interview but I would already given her a painting so she was just being nice saying that. And she gave out pictures of herself in a little silver frame which was a cute idea. The food looked good everybody looked pretty. Slipped out at 12:00 and went home to walk the dogs.

She seems like she would have been a lot of fun and really easy to get to know in the end. I wish we had remembered she was around. Brigid called and said she is overworked. Truman's now got a tape recorder and he is doing all these interviews with everybody and Brigid has to transcribe them. I mean he could be getting $70000 to do big interviews like this and here he is doing it for nothing for Interview but then he keeps the copyright so he will be able to make them all into a book. Watched All in the Family then cabbed to Judy and Sam Peabody's to see Nureyev (cab $2.50). Nureyev arrived and he looked terrible-really old-looking. I guess the nightlife finally got to him. His masseur was with him. The masseur is also sort of a bodyguard. And I did not know this before I went over there but Nureyev had told the Peabodys that if Monique Van Vooren showed up he would walk out. He says she used him. But he is terrible. When he was so cheap and would not stay in a hotel Monique gave him her bed and now he says she uses him. he is mean he is really mean. At 1:30 the Eberstadts wanted to leave and I dropped them off (cab $3.50).

Liza's birthday party was at Halston's spread in the Olympic Tower. Catherine was wearing her new Halston a tight white one and she looked really good with her hair up. The party was not that great. It was missing people. Muhammad Ali never showed up and Liz Taylor did not either. But Carol Channing popped around the corner with Eartha Kitt who she said was dying to meet me but then we did not have anything to say to each other. Melba Moore was there. It was a nice party though a live band. Jane Holzer and Bob Denison was there and a couple of hustlers from Studio 54 who were not in black tie they were in white jumpsuits. Liza was wearing a gold Halston and she got upset when Dr. Giller pulled down on it because she would just been in the bathroom to fix it to stay up. It was a funny dress open from the crotch down to the floor in a V. And the Halston crowd has a new accent they are now all talking in a tongue-tied lisp. it is the new thing. And they all say [imitates] ""pussycat."" I met David Mahoney who runs Norton Simon that bought Halston and Martha Graham took me into a corner and said she would like to have tea with me. All the pretty girls were in Halstons. Diana Vreeland was there and Truman Capote with Bob MacBride. he is the person that was with Truman even back when I did the Rolling Stone interview with him in 1973. He looks even weirder than ever there was always something strange about him. But Truman told me that he could not go for the young ones meaning that it had to be this type. Bob MacBride is still taking notes-even when I first met him with Truman he was taking notes but I do not know what for. He still has the wife and six kids. he is lost a lot of weight. Actually he is lost everything-he looks strange. Al Pacino was there and he looked handsome-we have heard through the grapevine that he might be interested in renting Montauk so we will see about that. De Niro was there he looked fat and Scorsese was with them. Ken Harrison the porno star was at my table. Bianca and Stevie brought out a big birthday cake and Liza started singing ""New York New York"" but then Sterling St. Jacques went over and joined her singing and (laughs) she got upset and moved over to another microphone and sang some more. And then I asked Marty Scorsese if he would ever met Margaret Trudeau and he said no and so I went and got her I was pushing her as an actress. Marty told me Julia sends her love. I told him they should get back together and he said he could not that they were just friends now. he is so short. God. Halston was kissing Liza and Bianca was lost somewhere with Federico De Laurentiis and the photographers were photographing and it looked unreal like a big movie scene."

He thought Halston and everybody made fools of themselves. He said Mick actually had hated Bianca in it. It was raining hard all day long. Went to church (newspapers and magazines $14). Paulette called and we talked about Dinner with Halston and I told her it was ripped off from me and she also said better not tell anybody it was so bad. The thing is I guess in that long amount of time everybody's real personality just comes out and it is too revealing of how boring they are. Jane Holzer called and wanted me to pick her up for the Gilmans but I begged off. It was raining and I had to bring up a painting to Sondra Gilman. Barbara Allen called and invited me to dinner with Stavros Niarchos. Richard Turley called twice to say he had both of my unlisted phone numbers he said he was going out with Tennessee Williams and wanted me to come along. It was a party the Gilmans were giving for some horse people from France. They had a new Lichtenstein the tough ones the still-life of the bathroom door. Everyone loved the portrait of Sondra they seemed to be saying that I really flattered her. They had caviar going around out of a big tin. Sondra introduced me right away to Adela Holzer and she was wonderful she has a hit now with two one-acters one is James Coco eating himself to death and the other is Siamese twins it is called Monsters. She invited me to lunch next week. She said she is going into the TV business so I was after her.

Penney"" and I do not know what it means except he let things slip about ""selling out"" and I guess he has actually sold out and will be having his name on cheap stuff. I guess that is what it is all about and that is what he is worried about he is not sure he is doing the right thing. I get so nervous with Halston because I do not want to say the wrong thing and get him mad because he is our tenant in Montauk and I do not want to blow it. He wanted to gossip but I just said things that I knew were out already."

Chris invited me to brunch with him and Jon Gould but I thought the magic would be gone if I saw Jon in the day. But then I decided to invite them up to my house instead. So then I was too nervous to go down to the office-I stayed home and cleaned. Oh and Jon told me the other night that he liked Popism but to Chris he said he did not think Paramount could do it. But maybe eventually something will happen with it. Maybe it is too soon. Oh and Jon said to me that he thought it was ""badly edited"" so I do not know if he is good at reading. I got cake and tea together. Jon brought his dirty laundry to wash while they visited because at first Jon said he could not come over that he had to do his laundry in a laundromat on Columbus Avenue and I told him I had a nice clean machine at my house. I want him to feel at home here. Janet Villella called and said she was sending a car to the ballet. We arrived at the Met. It was star-studded. It was a benefit for the Joffrey and the ballet was absolutely boring. It was just intricate sexy dances. Got drinks at intermission ($20). Ron Reagan Jr. was in the first part but he did not have much to do-he was the last boy in the last row with the last girl-but he dances a lot better he is improved so much. And then in the second part he was sitting in the presidential box with his mother and father and he and Doria were waving. they are going away again this month so I do not know how Doria's going to get her Interview work done."

I just said yes."

Gave the doorman at one of the buildings on the way an Interview and he was black and I always feel good giving black people the magazine when it is a black cover like the Grace Jones issue and the Richard Pryor one this time. And the Marcoses are still all in the news. Now they have found 3000 black panties. And it is funny to hear a congressman say ""Why did she need so many panties?"" I wish I had the shirt that the Marcos son once gave me right off his back a couple of years ago. And their Bulgari bill was for a million."

Walked down to Laurent on 56th Street for lunch. Chris Makos was just in a leather jacket and his boyfriend did not have a tie and it looked like a good restaurant but they were prepared for Dali's crowd so they did not care. Ultra Violet was sitting next to Dali and she did something great-she wore the exact same outfit as the day we met her in the sixties-a pink Chanel miniskirt suit with the same boots and her hair the same way. And she had a bracelet that was a Brillo pad she said that after she was done using it as jewelry she would clean her pot with it. And she had another bracelet made out of eight inches of the corrugated cardboard that they wrap bottles in sprayed gold and glued together. It looked great. I guess Ultra is creative in a way. She said I told her the last time I saw her that she should start a new look-""Park Avenue Punk""-and she said that is what gave her the idea to do ""Christian Punk""-and now she sings the Lord's Prayer and puts in the word ""asshole"" which I think is disgusting. she is going to do her act at the Riverboat and I told her she should start at CBGB. I would brought two copies of the Dali book so Dali could sign them and it turned out that one of them had already been signed ""To Fred"" so Dali re-signed it to me. Dali is so full of ideas and he is ahead in some things but then he is behind in others. it is odd. He was telling me about a book that is just been written in Paris about a brother and sister who were so in love that the brother (laughs) ate her shit. He said that my idea of piss-painting was old-fashioned because it would been in the movie Teorema which (laughs) is true it was. I knew that. And then he said something great-he said that the punks are the ""Shit Children"" because they are descendents of the beatniks and the hippies and he is right. is not that great? The Shit Children. He is smart. Dali told me that he was looking for ""beautiful freaks"" and I told him (laughs) I would send him Walter Steding. Walter was performing on his ""magic violin"" later that night at Max's. And Dali was really sweet he would brought a plastic bag full of his used-up palettes as a (laughs) present to me.

Sylvester was looking good. he is back with his wife Sasha she was there she is cute and smart she looks very young. I do not know why he would leave her for Susan Anton. I made him take off his shirt and he was wearing some kind of medal. I used ten rolls of film because he is really really hard to photograph. From the front his neck is skinny then from the side it looks three feet wide. From the front he has a huge chest and from the side no chest at all. His hands are pretty I used his hands but sometimes they look tiny and sometimes they look huge. he is like Rubber Man. He had the bodyguard who was the bodyguard Tom Sullivan used in Cocaine Cowboys so we talked about Tom. Sylvester talked about the Academy Awards he said he hated All That Jazz. He said the Academy Awards ignored him and Woody Allen this year. He said he is about to go to Hungary to do a movie an action movie and then after that he wants to do the Jim Morrison story. I told him we were really good friends with Jim and that Tom Baker was his good friend and that he should talk to Tom who is in town by the way and he is calling me. I told Stallone he should do the Linda Lovelace book. He said that he was worried I guess that he was a one-movie person and he named a few people that were one-movie people. He named somebody from The Boys in the Band. We were there for about an hour. His wife had gone into the other room and she did not come out to say goodbye I do not know why.

Sam and PH picked me up and we went to the Hard Rock Cafe for Paul Shaffer's live radio show (cab $7). And Paul had Christopher Reeve there and he said he loved the Greg Gorman pictures of him in Interview. And Peter Frampton was there and two Grateful Deads and two Cars.

I took a peanut jar with me to get holy water and I spent a couple of hours doing that. You go in and you press a button and holy water comes out and you fill up your jar and take it home. It took another couple of hours to put it all over the house. And Nelson called me from L.A. He said that he would been in the hospital because on St. Patrick's Day he and Bobby De Niro started eating a five-pound cheddar cheese with Jack Daniel's and day by day that is all Nelson was eating until finally he had pains and he went to the hospital and they said that the cheese had turned to rock and they gave him a laxative to break it up.

Then we rested and were taken to Graziella's brother's who lives on the waterfront and they made us some dinner. There was an old ex-movie star and an ex-fashion designer. They served all this food but Graziella and her brother did not eat anything themselves and that does make you feel very peculiar so I learned my lesson-from now on when we invite people to lunch I will eat."

And people were stocking up with oranges and apples and Easter eggs and with shopping bags taking stuff and some people were collecting cups and even plastic knives and forks. And let us see what else ... a lady had her teeth in a napkin and the guy went to clear it away and she got excited. It was a lot of hard work. Wilfredo was good he handed out the ham he worked hard. They used six of those restaurant urns of coffee. And the four of us prayed and we saw a lady bring in a potted plant and trade it in for one of the better ones there.

But it is finally scheduled for me to shoot the picture on Thursday. Peter Duchin's orchestra played. he is another one of the guest stars on the boat this week.

Curley keeps calling telling about his escapades at Studio 54. Nelson called from Tarrytown where he is working on the trailer for Apocalypse Now. And Bobby De Niro says he might be able to get money for Trash II. Nelson's writing it with Paul. Oh and I have been running into Crazy Matty on the street a lot again. I told him to come by the office. I want to tape him and have that be my abstract movie. He said he is staying at the Grand Union Hotel on East 32nd Street.

But then the guy pointed out to Travolta that if he wore black he would fade into the background and you would only be able to see the girl he was dancing with so he changed his mind fast. That'll be a good scoop for Interview. Went over to the Criterion to see Breathless (tickets $10). it is strange to see Richard Gere doing this. If it would been somebody like Matt Dillon it would have been like a James Dean movie. it is that Sartre way the nothingness thing. You would think existentialism would be still modern but it is not. He does bad things and you see his ass all the time he just drops his pants every chance he gets. But it is strange to see someone that age doing that but maybe that'll bring back that kind of person. It was written by our old friend Kit Carson. The movie had an old-fashioned feeling to it.

There were supposed to be 600 people there and it looked like there were and I think I knew every single person. Earl McGrath Ahmet and Mica Ertegun Debbie Harry who is now got brown hair and looks so normal and ordinary she was cute. Nobody really took pictures of Ina Ginsburg's date Godunov I guess they just thought he was a long-haired blond hippie in a black leather jacket. Bob was with the Stassinopoulos lady the one who wrote the Maria Callas book. Then I kept running into strange-looking people who said they were ""co-owners"" of the club and I started getting worried about Francois. Philippa de Menil was introducing Heiner as her husband so I guess maybe they got married. I got drunk and got up to dance and people took pictures. Me with the girlfriend of Stephen Graham. Then the Pointer Sisters came on and sang ""Happy Birthday."" It was fun to see my boss Zoli there-I felt like a working girl. And I went up to John Belushi and said ""You never remember me"" because that is what he said to me twice when I did not know who he was. And then we danced together that was fun. Got home at 2:00 and Christopher called and said he was just at the Baths. I called Jon at the Beverly Wilshire."

And I was so shocked at the show because I had just bought some balls from a girl at the antiques flea market who had become sort of a friend she was from Max's and everything and she even told me this story about how she got these one-of-a-kind balls and then I go to the accessories show and there was a whole crate of them! I was so hurt because I thought she was a friend. it is why I stopped buying American Primitive because people could just paint it and bury it for a day and sell it to you. that is when I got into Art Deco because it was with a label and in books. But Stuart thought of a great way to get even with her he is going to tell her ""You know that horse I bought from you for $12? I sold it for $10000. It turned out to be the prototype for all those fakes."" he will just tell her that. is not he smart? is not that great? Oh and did I say that Tama told me she once knew a girl who worked for Stuart at his apartment and this girl thought he was so peculiar because he kept a quart of sour milk in the refrigerator and he would go to it once an hour and smell it."

And Jon was wearing the set of pearls I gave him that go down to the ground and it looked sort of beautiful on him he looked like a deep-sea fisherman. We arrived at Oak Bluff where all the gingerbread houses are and we photographed a wedding. The girl was Irish marrying a guy from South America. Then we drove to Edgartown. We were very hungry. We went across the street to the Colonial Inn and the people there went and got their copies of Popisw and Interview for autographs and I signed them. And one kid even came up with the Tate Gallery poster of my Marilyn (lunch $120). And then we took the ferry over to Chappaquiddick with the car ($5). And we photographed a guy giving us his whole story on where it happened and how it happened and why he did not believe it. We retraced all the steps to see if Ted Kennedy was really guilty of this accident and we came to the conclusion that he was. When we got home Jon called his family in Amesbury and then he said his grandfather had had a stroke and his dog had had a relapse so that instead of going back with us to New York he wanted us to drop him off in Amesbury.

John Reinhold picked me up and we walked from 66th Street to 96th Street and back and by that time I was so tired that I could not face going down to the Village or anywhere. My bones were aching so I decided to stay in and ate half a watermelon because Eizo told me watermelons are good for you that they wash out your kidneys. And I still have the pain. Doc Cox thinks it might be a kidney stone he does not know. it is like a muscle spasm. I think Lidija had me doing too many strenuous things-she kept making my routine harder and harder. But I think that a person my age instead of doing harder things should do repetitions of the same level more.

Bob called from Nantucket. He apologized for being cranky on the phone and said that he would gotten robbed and that was why that after Studio 54 he went down to the Cave and two boys from there robbed him of his jewelry but then one of them brought it all back the next day. He said that he was through with drugs and that he was drying out too. Oh and I guess Marina Schiano's spread it all over that Diana Vreeland and Fred had a big fight outside New Jimmy's in Paris. When he came back in he would mentioned it to me but I thought he meant they would just had an argument. The real story is that Diana actually hit him and YSL tried to help and she said ""No it is a fight between Fred and me!"" and she was crying and everything. Because she is jealous of Lacey Neuhaus she thinks Fred's making it with Lacey and I think she wants him to make it with her. Can you believe it? it is so crazy. The new Interview looked good. Paloma on the cover and it has fifteen pages of ads. Hoveyda was giving a dinner for Mrs. Saffra at the Pierre (cab $3). We went up to a whole big chic apartment right in the hotel. I sat next to Mimi Herrera under a Motherwell. She had a forty-carat diamond on. Poor Gina Lollobrigida was the only person there who had fake jewelry I think. Fake emeralds. She has really big tits. I should interview her. I told her she should hook up with Dino De Laurentiis. She said she did not know him that she was doing photography as a profession now. That guy we knew in the sixties Carlos the one who always said Edie stole his leopard-skin rug gave the toast. I remember he sent a contessa down to the 47th Street Factory to try to get the coat back. But you know now that I think about it I guess Edie probably did steal it but only in fun."

Bob spent the whole day on the phone about his birthday party. it is funny some people actually want to have big birthday parties. Tauruses always do. Bianca's the same way. Bianca had called and said that she had two tickets for David Bowie for me so I gave my two tickets to Catherine who was wanting to go so badly. Doc Cox called and said he was giving a party for me June 7. For me right? He said he has some pills that I should come in and get that'll dissolve the stones in my gallbladder without an operation. Dropped Catherine off ($3.50) and went home to get ready. Jed had Tom Cashin there and we walked over to Halston's and Halston had a limo and so did Stevie. We waited for Bianca to get dressed and then rode over to Madison Square Garden. The music was too loud and then Dr. Giller screamed in my ear ""DID YOU GET DEAF YET?"" and that did it for me I think that is what finally made me deaf. We went backstage and had drinks and Bianca was in David Bowie's dressing room and when she came out she said that we were having lunch with him at 1:00 tomorrow at Quo Vadis. Then he went on stage again. Then we went up to 1060 Fifth to the birthday party Diane Von Furstenberg was giving for Bob. Kevin opened the door. It was not too crowded. Bob's mother and father were there and I never noticed before that Bob's father is attractive. I have met him before but he really looked good. Bob kissed me for my gift and that was embarrassing. Catherine was with Tom Sullivan and somewhere along the line Tom said to Bianca that he would rented Montauk for the summer and then Bianca was not talking to me and left without saying anything so I think my romance with Halston and Bianca and Stevie is over. Stevie said ""Bianca's upset."" See Vincent called Mick to see if he would pay for the place if Bianca took it and Mick said no so ... I do not know what to do. I wonder if I am still having lunch with David Bowie. Should I call her up?"

When you flatten out product boxes they are so beautiful. I have noticed that People is putting people with problems on the cover. Like the David Soul wife-beating cover and now Kristy McNichol with her breakdown. And I can see we are going to be having problems getting people for Interview covers from now on because I think Rolling Stone is putting the pressure on telling people that if they want the Rolling Stone cover they can not do Interview. But you know our Interview with Sting on the cover was the biggest seller yet and all the music covers sell well like Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. And the reason I am thinking that Rolling Stone is starting to play tough is because we can not get Travolta and we could not get Sean Penn. So we need to think of people to put on the cover young people new kids. it is got to be at the exact right time not too early or late.

It was the night of Bob's birthday party at the new Club A that Elizinha Goncalves was giving for him. I picked up Jon and we went to 333 East 60th Street to Club A (cab $7). It was really a great party so glamorous you would never think it was for Bob all these great people were there. I was next to Betsy Bloomingdale and I talked to her she said Alfred was still sick. ""Suzy"" was there and Lynn Wyatt flew in for the party and Farrah Fawcett and Ryan O'Neal. They had these old men serving who looked like they were from those restaurants on the Lower East Side from years ago the good kind of waiters. It must have taken a lot of work this party and a lot of planning. And the food was really great. They had caviar stuffed into smoked salmon so you had two courses in the same breath."

He said he would been to a party the night before where it was a bunch of ""straight"" carpenters inviting a bunch of gay faggots. I do not know what that means. Cabbed with Bob up to 94th Street to Paul Jenkins and Joanne du Pont's house. Ran into Linda Eastman's father the lawyer and his wife on the street. Paul Jenkins is nutty. He told Bob and me ""I nearly fainted when you called today to say that you could not stay for dinner because you were not invited for dinner. you are invited next week."" Instead of just not saying anything and we would have thought we would been invited twice. The du Pont lady told me that the first time she met me was at Mica Ertegun's and we were in front of the fireplace and the screen exploded. She happened to be wearing the biggest diamond in the world one of them. She just got it from a sultan the day before and when she got back to the hotel that night-she would not say which hotel-she put it in the safe and that night she said they switched ice on her gave her a piece of glass. Paul Jenkins showed us his collection-American Indian and Indian Indian stuff. When I was in India I could have gotten anything for nothing but it is one of those things I just do not understand. Like Chinese stuff-I can not tell which is the good stuff it all looks like the same junk. And he told us ""Lincoln Kirstein had his annual birthday freakout but this time he physically threw his boyfriend out of the house"" so Paul was setting the guy up in a little apartment he said that belongs to Zero Mostel's son. I really want to do people like Lincoln Kirstein in Interview. I think it would be so fascinating to do him our way and do it really good."

At 9:00 Thomas picked me up and he said Richard Gere and Silvinha would meet us at VanDam so we went down there and it was empty on Sunday night. Had broiled fish but did not eat it. Richard was wearing a little hat and a mustache and that is his look from The Cotton Club. And he was screaming about newspapers never getting things right he was grand. He said he only came because he wanted to meet Keith Haring. he is buying art. He told me how he threw a Come painting of mine into the fireplace. What happened was I would given Jean Michel Basquiat a Come painting and he had it with him when he and Richard got drunk together and Jean Michel Basquiat did not have anything to write his phone number on for Richard Gere except this painting of mine so he wrote it on that and gave the painting to Richard. Then when Richard woke up the next morning he said he saw it and thought it was disgusting and threw it into the fire. I told him it was my come but actually it was Victor's. And Richard said that if he had all the money he wanted he would buy all the paintings of Balthus who does the little girls smiling like after sex. They cost over a million now.

We got to the place and there were three limos out front-Bruno sure knows how to spoil artists fast. Julian lives in the same building as Les Levine and I was so jealous Julian bought it so cheap four years ago. he is just married he introduced me to a sort of beautiful wife. And does sort of bad paintings. he is very pushy. there is this whole group of kids doing this bad art I think they are all influenced by Neil Jenney. Then Bruno comes along and says ""I will buy everything"" and these kids get used to big money and I do not know what they will do when it is all over-oh but by then it will be something different I guess. I went to church gave my thanks for the trip and getting back alive. Did phone calls and somehow got mesmerized. I got so nervous thinking about all these new kids painting away and me just going to parties I figured I would better get cracking.

There were four bodyguards with us all the blacks just love her. The Wiz is a big hit I did not know that. The concert was sensational there were bravos. Then there was a Valentino party at 54. I guess Stevie was trying to make it a really bad party because he had the waiters dressed up like Pilgrims and he was serving turkey. He said he had to explain to Valentino why he was doing it that way. He said he told him ""Well you know America was discovered by an Italian"" and he said that they (laughs) understood. The front of Studio 54 was decorated like the front of a boat. I lost Halston but I found him a little later eating a turkey leg and he made me have some. The last place you want to eat meat from is a discotheque but later I saw Stevie eating the turkey too so I guess it was okay. Barbara Allen was there going home to meet Bryan Ferry."

Ran into Lester Persky and Truman Capote who looked pickled. And Truman kissed my hand. What does that mean? And I asked him if he was going to the party afterwards and he said ""No. I can drink at home."" Got home and saw a little of the Kennedy Years thing on TV and Republicans must have done the script because it had Jackie worrying about the curtains when they were having the Cuban crisis.

I heard he locked the door to his bedroom when he left so Shenge can not get in and he did not leave him any money either. Can you imagine being married to Jean Michel Basquiat? you would be on pins and needles your whole life. Then Philip Johnson had gone to Dallas and David Whitney was having a dinner for Michael Heizer and me at Odeon (cab $8). David was having his first of about seven martinis and a beer. And he was talking again about ""when Pops pops off."" But David will probably pop off before Pops. He wears the same glasses that Philip does now.

I told him nobody cares that it is chic to be in it and to forget about it. they are selling Halston's floor in the Olympic Tower out from under him. it is so sad. Where did Halston go so wrong when he sold his name? What should he have done that he did not? that is what I want to know. And I want to know it from him I want to sit down and find out what I should do if I ever sell myself. Find out when and where he made his mistakes. In case I ever want to let a big corporation buy me out and just be a figurehead. Because there is got to be a way to do it where you do not lose all your power the way Halston did.

Picked up Catherine and walked over to the Pierre Hotel to meet Jodie. Said hello to lots of people who said hello to me. At the Pierre I saw a beautiful woman staring at me and it turned out to be Ingrid Bergman. While I was talking to her Coco Brown started waving and yelling from a car. Ingrid's I think husband came for her and then Catherine and I went into the restaurant to wait for Jodie. She came in with her mother and a guy they said they would picked up I think in Liverpool and I could not tell if it was a bodyguard or the mother's boyfriend. Jodie had on high boots and a hat and was really cute and we loved her ($30 with tip). Then we all walked over to F.A.O. Schwarz and looked at toys. Bought some for Jodie ($10). She signed autographs. On the way back to the Pierre a guy was selling big candy canes and he gave Jodie one and me one. Went home. Nelson Lyon called from L.A. and told me about his Thanksgiving-Paul Morrissey had invited him to dinner at Chase Mellen's house and then called back to disinvite him saying it was going to be ""small and intimate"" and that he would made a mistake inviting anyone. As soon as Nelson hears that anything is ""small and intimate"" he gets paranoid he is not invited and goes crazy to get there so he put his mind to it and got there through someone else. It turned out to be thousands of people there so when he saw Paul he said ""Small intimate world is not it?"" Brigid Polk [see Introduction] called and said she is down to 197. Ever since she saw herself in Bad [see Introduction] weighing 300 pounds and went on a diet she is so boring to talk to-she never does anything she never thinks anything she just lies there in bed in her room at the George Washington Hotel and waits for the fat to roll off. I told her I will give her a job-that she could let some roll off around the Factory while she answers phones but she will not. it is taken her thirty-nine years to lose weight and it will probably take her another thirty-nine years to get to work. I was too tired to meet the Vreeland crowd for dinner. Watched twenty-five years of Lucille Ball on TV instead.

Then we went down to the flea market. And we ran into one of the Interview editors the new one Kevin Sessums. He was alone buying a picture of a girl with cleavage which was odd (research materials $210). Then they dropped me. Then I heard that Martin died. He died in his new apartment that he got in the Village with all the money they raised for him at that benefit at the Pyramid. He bought whatever he wanted. He was such a sweet kid and so friendly and generous. With his affection too he was generous.
"Sunday, November 4, 1984","[Alba Clemente, Francesco Clemente, Jean Michel Basquiat]",0.0695904356060606,Went to meet Alba Clemente the beautiful wife of Francesco Clemente at their loft in the Tower Records building. She studied acting she has a great laugh and she is rich. They live in India six months a year. that is why his paintings look the way they do I guess. Then we went to the Odeon (cab $10). It was fun we chit-chatted about art. There were big silences though. Jean Michel Basquiat is so hard to talk to. His thing is he is in love with waitresses so he gets quiet and watches them. Alba said that her girl who was minding the children had a crush on him (lunch $90). And then we went back to her place so that Jean Michel Basquiat could meet the girl Monica but she would taken the kids out. And then Jean Michel Basquiat was getting inspired from seeing Clemente's work and wanted to go do some painting himself. So we went to the studio (cab $3.50) and worked two hours. Jean Michel Basquiat was painting back in the images he would painted out when he was on smack and he came up with some masterpieces. Then he called the girl Monica and invited her to dinner. She wanted to go to the Lone Star because her semi-boyfriend who is Schnabel's assistant was going to be there but Jean Michel Basquiat did not want to go there because he was afraid if there was competition that he would lose the fuck.

He said she wanted the address of someone who had put her S.C.you.M. Manifesto into their book on women's lib she wanted to shoot them or sue them or something. Victor called from California not quite over his acid trip. He wants to stay out there I told him he would be wanting to come back soon. When I got to the Iranian embassy (cab $2.50) it was full of movie directors and producers- Elia Kazan Elliot Kastner Milos Forman Lester Persky Barbara Loden-thirty or forty people. Ambassador Hoveyda said we should do Polaroids right then for the portrait of Princess Ashraf and get it over with so we went into a room. It was so easy. The Iranians have the best plastic surgeons in the world and every picture-if you keep it very white-comes out great. The princess said they have seen and done everything in town-every movie every play even Outrageous. Dinner was great the best ever there. The princess ate a lot but the queen when she was there did not eat much at all maybe because she was afraid of poisonings although the food is pre-tasted. Then everyone went upstairs and in barged Barry Landau with Margaret Trudeau. He got in by saying he was my very best closest dearest friend. But it worked out fine. And Bella Abzug and her husband Martin came with Shirley MacLaine. Milos who I really like offered Margaret a part in Ragtime as Evelyn Nesbit but she would have to go nude he said and she is thinking about it. I told Milos that I wanted a part in Hair and he said that if Margaret and I were in Central Park tomorrow morning at 9:00 we could have bit parts. I told him I wanted to be in Ragtime too.
"Sunday, November 9, 1980",[],0.07954545454545454,-Paris Thomas called from New York he would taken the Concorde early in the morning. The stuff he told me the night before had made me really upset. He said not to repeat anything because he does not like to get involved with talking about people's relationships. But he actually did not tell me anything that I did not already know it was just that it was upsetting to hear it.

He never changed his name from Warhola to Warhol that should have given me the clue. He just does not like New York I guess. I never took him out to anything. I do not know if that would have made a difference. I do not think so but I do not know. He said he is going back to take care of his mother and father because they have been so good to him. I told him oh sure who're you kidding. His father John is the one who worked for Sears he just retired. I called Fred and he was acting grand with me telling me off. I just could not take it. I told him he was sounding very grand for somebody who'd dropped his pants at Nell's and then when I said that he became a different person-he did not think I knew about that and it stopped him cold. Watched MTV-the rebroadcast of our Fifteen Minutes show-to see if it had aged well and it did still look current it looked modern. we have got to get the colors brighter though. I have got to work on that. It should look the way Madonna looks in her ""Papa do not Preach"" video where she is dancing like Marilyn or Kim Novak. Those strong colors. Blond hair and orange lipstick on black."

I mean think of it twenty-three years. Then we started to watch The Users on TV and we called each other about five times. Jaclyn Smith was so good. They had her hair commercial on too.

The Liz is $400000. they are all from Philippa and Heiner Friedrich from their Dia Foundation. Ran into a lot of old ladies who said they saw me on The Love Boat. And then I walked home and called that kid Stephen Bluttal from MOMA who invited me to the closing night of the Lincoln Center Film Festival (cab $3). And the movie at the Film Festival was five stories hung together by a bird with a bell on it. And it was in Italy in those beautiful empty towns they find to film in."

Then met Bob at about 5:00 to go up to see the Dalai Lama at St. John the Divine Cathedral on 112th Street and Broadway. We picked Fred up and went uptown (cab $6). The Dalai Lama gave his speech it was so boring he had an interpreter but I do not know why because later he talked English very well. He was wearing an orange and red dress. Then there was a party in the back and everyone was standing around shaking hands. Bob said he was not impressed with the Dalai Lama because he was not as good as the pope. Then we left got a cab dropped Bob off and we went to meet Richard Weisman and Catherine at Madison Square Garden where they were going to retire Rod Gilbert's number 7 (cab $7). Catherine has to go to the hospital to have the nerve in one of her hands retied because she still can not feel it. Her mother's coming to town and Catherine hopes she will not notice anything. Only her brothers Valentine and Jasper know what happened.

He said that he was cooking but I think everything was actually bought. It was really hot in the kitchen the oven was on and the sun was pouring in but nothing was cooking. I think he was actually just in there drinking pretending to cook. There was a bottle of Stolichnaya in the refrigerator. He offered some to Bob who had to turn it down and then he insisted that I have some and he took one of those double wine glasses and poured it three-quarters full and then put in a drop of orange juice. I took it but just kept it in my hand. I went to the other room and talked sculpture with Bob MacBride but I kept running into the kitchen to check on Truman. He had some tomatoes sitting around the kitchen. He showed me a pie he would baked he said but I do not think he had. I think it was bought because it had cardboard under it. But he let me take a picture of him holding it like he had just baked it. He was talking about what a great cook he was how he would made veal stew the night before. Eventually he stole my drink. He served black bean soup and he insisted it had to be served lukewarm so after all that cooking in the kitchen the soup was cold. And it looked grey. I did not really eat any of it but Bob-Bob Colacello-thought it was great. I dumped my bean soup in the bathroom. Nobody saw me. I had to run around the apartment a little before I finally made it to the bathroom with the soup so they would not notice. Truman was getting more and more loaded. I taped all afternoon. He told us he went one night to Flamingo with Liza and Stevie and there were all these sex acts with boys in cages and they went into the owner's office and it was a really straight-looking guy about thirty-five and Truman asked him ""Why did you start this place?"" And before he told us the guy's answer Truman looked at us and really built it up he said ""This has got to be the greatest line in history."" Then he said ""The guy looks at me and says 'Sometimes I get horny.' "" And Truman kept repeating that all afternoon and laughing at it (cab $2)."

Pretty day. Cabbed downtown ($3.50) then walked to work. Richard Weisman and his little kids arrived and Margaret Trudeau was with them. she is really split up with her husband now so she let us herself be photographed with anybody and I guess she is been dating Richard for a while. She was primping the kids' hair. I did not have enough light bulbs though and they fought over the teddy bear. Cabbed to the Whitney ($2). Bob Rauschenberg blew me a kiss in the elevator and then later came over and said it was silly to blow a kiss so he kissed me. Jasper was drinking Jack Daniel's. It was a small party just for lenders old people. I ran downstairs to get a catalogue and then I looked around to have Jasper sign it but I could not find him so I had Rauschenberg sign it and then I did find Jasper and he rubbed out Rauschenberg's signature and signed ""To a Lender."" John Cage was there with Lois Long de Antonio's first wife. Jack and Marion Javits were there and Jack gave a speech. Robert Rosenblum was there and he just got married. I guess it is another Nicky Weymouth-Kenny Jay Lane-type thing. he is from the gay old Henry Geldzahler crowd. Mrs. Irving who is the president of the museum whose mother is a Whitney was there. She lives down the street from me and I have asked her a few times if I could rent the garage space in her carriage house for the car. I want it so badly but nothing ever happens. At the Whitney she said that she definitely would call me-and I think it is because I ran into her husband going into the garage that morning. When we sat down to dinner there were packages of Philip Morris cigarettes at each place- they were the sponsor-and when nobody was taking them I took them ""for the box."" [see Introduction] There was one red one but I could not get it."

The invitation said 8:30 so I thought there would be drinks first and I took my time and got there at 9:00 and I was so embarrassed everyone was sitting down already. Marie-Jose was scared that I was not going to show up at all. Andrew Young and his wife were there. The thing that was most interesting-it was all I could think about once she told me-was Marie-Jose's dogs. She was talking about her black and white scotties and she confessed that the black one was a scottie but that the white one was just a dog done up to look like a matching scottie! She had the hair done that way she said it was something she would always wanted. The dinner party was for Marie's father Bruno who never showed up because it was raining.

Some papers say the Marcoses are buying up everything in the you.S. but that could be not true the papers can lie. Our government must want them out though. Like the you.S. must have wanted the Shah to fall. But let us see did we want to lose in Vietnam? No but after everything that is in the papers this week I guess the Kennedys were just too busy having an affair with Marilyn to worry about Vietnam.

But then it seems like the Republicans are the ones that keep saying they are getting out so that when they do not it will look even worse for Carter. Like the Post has it front page and they are for Reagan. And on the news they are saying that Israel is giving parts to Iran for their military equipment. The cable TV guy in a small town said it was true but the government denies it. I watched Sabrina on TV and William Holden and Audrey Hepburn looked so old. It seemed so old-fashioned talking about Long Island and the North Shore. I walked the dogs. I watched Hooper and my God it was great just Burt Reynolds and his usual lines. He played a stunt man.

I did not want to go-I can not stand Mike Nichols-but we had to go because Ara Gallant had set it up. We were supposed to have Sunday lunch at the Carlyle but then it was moved downtown to Lady Astor's. I went to church and then picked up Ara and Bob and Averil ($5.). When we got there Mike Nichols had left. His assistant said Nichols was mad because we were fifteen minutes late. What nerve to leave after making me go down there and oh it was awful-this doctor guy telling me I am Polish. He spells his name W-a-r-c-h-o-l. This Polish fairy asking me questions like did I live alone. He invited us to Poland next September. Mike Nichols met him because he collects Arabian horses-he has 120 horses in Connecticut-and when he goes to Communist Poland every September to get more this Dr. Warchol helps him. I went to bed early. Talked to Jed's decorating-business partner Judith Hollander about furniture restoration and about the fights I have been having lately with Jed."

I am sure it is good though he is my favorite painter after Rosenquist. Then cabbed to Jon's to work on making a play-a musical-out of the tape transcripts.

This was his ""trip to the country."" He never leaves town. Stuart is a real weirdo. Full of knotted nerves. And he was excited later because a pipe cleaner was coming over. that is what he calls the girls who come over for sex. Got stuck in the Polish Day parade. Nick Rhodes was calling during the day but I missed the calls. One of the Taylors is not in the group anymore but Nick owns the name so it is still Duran Duran. Billy Boy I hear is in town but he has not called me or Chris. And I really hate him now-his jewelry breaks! Every gingerboy broke! Every one! But I can not imagine why he did not call. he is a social climber so he must be after somebody better. Then went to meet that kid named Stephen Bluttal from the Museum of Modern Art and went to the closing night of the Lily Tomlin play. Had really good seats. The Campbell's Soup Can was all through it and the play seemed a lot like the Philosophy book. She does a bag lady that really sounded like a bag lady. She has a great body. At the end Jane Wagner came out and they were crying and kissed very feminine. There was a party afterwards but I did not go to it. Bianca and Glenn Dubin broke up. I never understood why they were together in the first place what she could get from him. Because she is a hustler and she really was after Calvin-I saw her just be so after him. But then marrying Bianca would not kill gay rumors and Kelly was a real girl. But Bianca should have gone after someone like Sid Bass.

This was the day of Susan Blond's wedding to Roger Erickson and the thing was at the Cafe Luxembourg and I did not want to take Jean Michel Basquiat home with me to pick a painting up for a present so we both made her a painting there. Jean Michel Basquiat is so difficult you never know what kind of mood he will be in what he will be on. He gets really paranoid and says ""you are just using me you are just using me"" and then he will get guilty for getting paranoid and he will do everything so nice to try to make up for it. But then I can not decide what he has fun doing either. Like when we got to Susan's he did not like it I do not know if it is because of the drugs or because he hates crowds or because he thinks it is boring. And I tell him that as he becomes more and more famous he will have to do more and more of these things (cab $10). I met Roger's mother and she looks and acts just like Susan. Jonathan Roberts flew in from California and I asked him why he bothered. I said ""Just because you had a date once with Susan?"" Danny Fields was the best man he gave a little speech. And Steve Rubell was there and he was not that friendly. I mean he was really friendly but sometimes he is really really really friendly. So he was not friendly enough. A woman at the party was from Los Angeles and she was complaining about a table she bought from Ronnie Levin and saying that he took the money and did not get her the table and so she called his mother and the mother said that Ronnie's disappeared. I asked PH about it and she said it is serious that nobody's heard from him for weeks and that with his big mouth if he were alive he would have called someone by now."

We had tickets for the press room but we stayed out on the floor. Dolly Fox and Keith could not believe how many autographs I had to sign for the Jersey kids. The concert was long from 7:00 to 11:30. The Boss talks dumb and he is a Democrat but he does not exactly say so-he just talks about getting jobs back for the steel mills and things. he is a real little fireball. And the choreography well if this is choreography then I can do choreography. And by the way slam dancing I think I could really be good at. I really do think so. Bruce's laugh is the cute thing he giggles. And he is gotten good-looking. He was not good-looking when he was younger. And then we came back to the city and went to P.J. Clarke's.

Truman had told me we would be having caviar and potatoes but instead he had bad quiche. Truman was listening to records Donna Summer I think. The guy from California had joints and he and Bob and Truman smoked them and Truman said that after the joint he would be really exciting and interesting but he was not. I was talking about the Gay Bob doll. Robert Hayes had one at the Factory it is a doll that comes out of a closet and it is wearing an earring and a necklace and a plaid shirt and bluejeans and a handbag and a big cock and I guess I said the wrong thing because everybody there was named Bob but if you ever want to get anybody anything get them that it is so funny."

He fell in love just because he did not have enough to do and after he left Peter called and I told Peter that we would have to cut off Christopher's purse strings because then he would have to work harder because all he does now is sit around and think about romance. And is not that what families always do-cut off the purse strings? So he will have to go back into the darkroom and start printing for other customers again because he has it too easy he makes so much money printing pictures up for me. And I am so nervous about my show. The Rolling Stones just got glowing reviews-and what they did was just a repeat of their old album. And here I am doing a show repeating all the old Pop images.... I picked up the phone and it was my first superstar Naomi Levine and she was saying ""Oh I hear you are having a show. I am going to come and see you."" I said ""Oh I am not going to be there. Oh am I having a show? Really? Where?"" The dialogue was straight from the sixties. I heard myself going ""Oh really? Oh. Oh. Really? Oh."""

It turned out to be a really intimate dinner for only about fourteen people. Lester arrived with Richard Gere and John Schlesinger arrived and Tommy Dean. Lester has a thin mustache now. Richard Gere asked me how Lester and I had met and I told him that we met in the gutter ten years ago and this time Lester did not like that so it was my first faux pas. Richard Gere said that ten years ago he came in on a bus from New Jersey and went to see our movie Bike Boy in the Village and he said from then on he is been trying to be an actor-it took him eleven years he said. he is big and good-looking. We were talking about girls and he was talking about meeting the most beautiful girl in Rome-Dalila DiLazzaro-at a party in Zeffirelli's backyard and I told him we discovered her-that Paul Morrissey had seen her doing a soap commercial on Italian TV and made her the star of Frankenstein-and he was impressed. he is going to be in a new play called Bent which is an English one about homos in concentration camps. I asked him if he was Italian and he said no that he was French and Irish. Steve Rubell came later. When Steve's normal he is so distant. Lester told funny stories. Then I made another faux pas I said that it was so much fun there nobody should leave. And Steve was sitting right there. And I was not even thinking about the party at 54 I was just wanting to make Lester spend more money entertaining us because he is always so cheap. John Schlesinger gave a speech.

Jean Michel Basquiat called and he told me about the problems he is having with Shenge who takes care of his place on Great Jones Street. Shenge has his own place downstairs but then he goes up and uses Jean Michel Basquiat's bath and bed and now after staying at the Ritz Carlton Jean Michel Basquiat is used to having his bed tucked in. He found Shenge on the streets he was not living anywhere. he is like a Rastafarian. he is married he has a wife and little boy in the Bronx I think. Shenge's bed used to be right by the front door so it was like he was just yanked in off the street it was so peculiar. Got a cab and picked up PH to go to the Odeon to have dinner with our Interview photographer Matthew Rolston and the Holland boy-he is Joanna Carson's son-who PH just met in L.A. ($10). He was very good-looking and I offered to make him a ""First Impression"" with Matthew doing the photograph. Matthew said that when he shot Joan Rivers for Interview she told him she used to be a photo stylist and worked for Cecil Beaton. And Matthew wears brooches. he is the one who started Michael Jackson wearing them. When he photographed Michael for Interview he gave him his own brooch and Michael then started wearing them all the time. But Matthew must like women because when he photographs them he makes them look gorgeous (dinner $150)."

Decided to see the Presented by Coppola movie at the 57th Street Playhouse. It was boring. Like being at the Cinematheque in the sixties that kind of a movie. Cuts together a guy cutting salami eating a Twinkie clouds going faster than they should through the sky- everything you never wanted to see. It was over quickly though. And it was packed crowds waiting to get in (popcorn $5). And then I could not sleep because I have been taking these things called taurine and l-argentine and cystine. And selenium. From the Life Extension book and from the nutritionist kid Shea. S-H-E-A. I always spell it because he always spells it. He says ""I am Shea. S-H-E-A."" I had to get up three or four times to pee because of them."
"Sunday, September 19, 1982","[Janet Sartin, Marc Balet, Robert Hayes]",0.07943121693121692,I would seen Robert Hayes's boyfriend Cisco going down the street with someone else the other day and I saw Robert crying and so I thought they would broken up and I asked Marc Balet and he told me that Cisco had just found out he had gay cancer but that it was a secret. But then later that day Robert told me anyway. They told him he got it three years ago and it takes three years for it to show up but I do not know how they would know that since they do not know anything about it or even what it is. Robert says he is been checked and he does not have it. But he would been going to Janet Sartin and he was there at the same time I was and I just know she used the same needle on me and I do not know if she sterilizes it. I only like it when you use the needle once and throw it away. And I am not going to go to her anymore anyway because I am just covered with pimples I do not know what good it is done.
"Sunday, September 20, 1981","[Diana Vreeland, Nan Kempner]",-0.012499999999999999,"Cab to Mortimer's for the dinner Nan Kempner was having for Ungaro ($3). I said to Diana Vreeland ""Have you seen Mommie Dearest?"" And she said ""Have I seen it?! That was my life! That was the closest thing to me when I get mad I really tear into people and that is not entertainment!"" Two hours into the dinner I could hear Fred's voice so loud sounding like Diana. I call him ""Dr. Hyde and Mrs. Vreeland"" when he drinks."
"Sunday, September 21, 1980",[Chris Hemphill],0.28080357142857143,I tried to watch TV but nothing good was on. Oh yeah that is right the debate. I could not stand to watch either one of them though-Reagan looked so old so crunched-up. And the other guy Anderson looks too much like Chris Hemphill.
"Sunday, September 21, 1986","[Alba Clemente, Andrew Cogan, Ann Magnuson, Jon Gould, Kenny Scharf, Stephen Sprouse, Susan Pile]",0.0941468253968254,"Kenny Scharf called and said there was a party for his wife Teresa's birthday in the park near the rowing bridge you go over to get across the lake. Met Stuart and went up there and finally found the party and not too many people were there but in a few minutes suddenly everybody arrived and there were seven birthday cakes. Keith showed up and Alba Clemente was with her little girl and Maripol was there and she is going bankrupt there is a sale of her stuff on Tuesday. Ann Magnuson was there and I like her. Nobody's talking about her in the movies yet. I guess they are waiting to see reactions. Susan Pile called and said she got a job at Twentieth Century Fox that starts in October so she is leaving Paramount. And the Diary can write itself on the other news from L.A. which I do not want to talk about. [NOTE:Jon Gould died on September 18 at age thirty-three after ""an extended illness."" He was down to seventy pounds and he was blind. He denied even to close friends that he had AIDS.] Stephen Sprouse called with good news-he said that he signed a deal with Andrew Cogan and that I am responsible because he met him through me and so he wanted me to be the first to know. is not that great? he will have his own store and a collection."
"Sunday, September 22, 1985",[],0.033680555555555554,Went to church. I always go for five minutes. Ten or five minutes. it is so empty but sometimes there is a wedding. Then cabbed down to Sixth Avenue and 26th Street to the flea market (cab $6). It was such a pretty day. You can still get Fiestaware cheap. It never went anywhere I guess.

I glued myself together and Curley picked me up and we went to 42nd Street to the WPIX radio station for the John Ogel Show. I would invited Walter Steding to play his magic violin on the air he was good and he sounded intelligent when he was interviewed. Then Lou Reed rushed in and said how glad he was to see us. Lou told me one of his dachshunds had had an operation on his back. I told him to come down to the Mudd Club with us later because they were having a Dead Rock Stars Night and he said he would go as himself but I told him he looks too good for that now. We stopped for dinner at One Fifth (cab $3). When we walked in Jackie Curtis-he is back to dressing as a girl-was at the bar with who else Taylor Mead who happened to be waiting for who else Viva. And then they were all on their way down to the Mudd Club. Had drinks ($45.14) and then it was 11:30 so we went to the Mudd Club too (cab $3). They had a room where Janis Joplin was putting needles in her arm and they had a Paul McCartney room-I guess because of the rumor that he died once-and they had Mama Cass choking to death with a plate of ham sandwiches in front of her and you could take the sandwiches and eat them. It was really sick. Vincent and Don Munroe were there videotaping. Viva was reading poetry but I missed it I did not see her. Francois de Menil was there. The ex-Mr. Viva was there. They had girls in black crying and then outside a hearse pulled up. I was really tired. Dropped everybody off (cab $15).
"Sunday, September 23, 1984",[Jean Michel Basquiat],0.10775613275613274,Tried Jean Michel Basquiat because he would wanted to go to the Pop Art show at the Whitney and then work together but he was not around. Jon and I went there without him (tickets $5). I autographed a lot of the postcards they sell there people handed them to me. Of Marilyn and the others. I do not think I get any money from these. I had a fight with Fred because he wants me to sign with a card company because he said that then that card company will stop the other card companies from putting them out but I do not know if that is true. Rauschenberg was the best in the show somehow his stuff looks new. I do not know why. And Jasper Johns's stuff was good too. The Segal looked good because it was big but it was so ugly. The tires outside looked so terrific that you thought the rest of the show would be on that scale or something but the Whitney is small. there is some early stuff of mine a lot of mine. Jean Michel Basquiat had told me he thought my stuff looked the best but you know ... So then wandered the streets went home and Jean Michel Basquiat called. Now he has rooms in two hotels. One at the Ritz Carlton and then he moved to the Mayfair Regent on 65th Street. I guess he was competing with me to live in the chic East 60s. I told him that the TV was terrible around here and he did not believe me but when he got to the Mayfair and found out he could not get the Showtime channel or anything like that he learned his lesson. Good TV means a lot. So he went back to the Ritz Carlton. He has a big Jacuzzi there.
"Sunday, September 24, 1978","[Ken Harrison, Ursula Andress]",0.07546296296296297,-Los Angeles We went to pick up Ursula Andress and when we got to Venice I was dragged through the crowd. Marisa was wearing a gold sequined beret and a gold sequined jacket and skin-tight black stretch pants-you could see her pussy-and her sister Berry was wearing a blue and white-striped cotton dress. Sue was wearing a flowing hot pink chiffon gown. Three thousand five hundred people showed up. Then we got it all coordinated so that I got into my car real quick and was taken to the restaurant Robert's where the party was. It was on the beach. A guy came over and said that he had the biggest cock in L.A. so I offered to sign it and Marisa got so excited she leaned over to look at the cock and her hair caught fire in the flames of a candle-it was like instant punishment. And Ken Harrison was at the opening but he got lost in the shuffle and Sue was dying to meet him. Everyone was dying to meet him because of his big cock in my show.

Woke up at 6:00 fell back asleep up again at 8:00 and 9:00 turned on the TV and watched all the cartoons. Archie and Amos were still away they would gone out to Montauk with Jed-we are still trying to rent the place. Diana Vreeland called and said someone should talk to Fred about his drinking problem to tell him he is so attractive but that when he is drunk he is so unattractive. Stevie Rubell called and said he had tickets to the Lillian Carter dinner at the Waldorf. I had to get into black tie again but the bottoms always itch so much that is why I wear bluejeans usually with the black-tie top. But tonight I innovated something I put the black pants on over my bluejeans and it did not really look lumpy it worked so I walked out of the house in two pairs of pants at 6:15. Cabbed to the Waldorf ($2.50). When I got there Stevie was nowhere around. A boy took me to a small room on the side where there was a reception for Miz Lillian. She was wearing a blue sort-of-nightie and she was really thrilled to see me she loved the pictures I would done of her and she invited me to the party in her room afterwards. She told me it was 7-N. Finally Stevie came in he would just had a joint he said because these things made him so nervous. He said he would never been with so many other Jews before. It was the Synagogues of America- something like that-giving a medal to her. Then we went into the big room. I was at table 3. There were about thirty-five Jews on stage. The Edgar Bronfman guy-the kidnappee's father-paid for the dinner. He talked very classy- if you closed your eyes you thought it was Dick Cavett-and he was the only one who had a pretty young wife who did not look Jewish. Andrew Young came over and shook my hand he looks like a butch Johnny Mathis. Then we had gefilte fish and it was a dairy dinner. While we ate they gave speeches and they sang ""God Bless America"" in English and Jewish. The cantor had a very good voice. It went on for hours. Andrew Young gave a speech about the United Nations and freedom. The food looked like airplane food. The best line of the evening was when Miss Lillian said ""I have never met so many Jews in my life. I must tell Jimmy."" Everyone was so shocked they laughed. She was good nervous. There were autographed copies of her book Away From Home at every place and I stole an extra one because Richard Kiley had not shown up. So Stevie and I left the Waldorf and went out to look for his car parked on Lexington. A $30000 Mercedes. He says it is his only big enjoyment in life having a car and parking wherever he wants to spending money on parking tickets. He said he has money in shoeboxes. He says we should go around to discos together because he has to pick up boys to work at Studio 54. Bob Weiner is doing his first big story for New York and it is on Stevie and Studio 54. Bob Weiner seems like he is in love with Stevie. (laughs) Deeply. Bob used to be so straight producing Broadway plays and then around '69 he became a hippie type and started listening to rock and roll and writing for that dirty newspaper that was like Screw. At the party at The Ginger Man for the opening of the New York Film Festival Leticia Kent was there and John Springer who gave the party and Marcello Mastroianni and Gerard Depardieu who looked wonderful. He asked me for a French cigarette and I told him I did not have one but that I could get him a Quaalude so I went over to Stevie and he gave me one to take and I broke it into fourths and then did not take it. But Stevie kept saying ""You did not take your Quaalude."" They do not forget-people on drugs really do remember. So I let him see me taking part of it. Then I saw Howard Smith from the Voice so I went over to say hello. Howard's been writing letters to Valerie Solanis that is the latest thing he must have run into her in the Village. He told me he was sorry he would started that that he does not know how people that crazy are out in the streets. I told him maybe it was because she worked for the CIA. Stevie wanted to go to the Village to the clubs he wants to open one down there. The first place we went to was the Cock Ring. The area has changed they got rid of the back rooms and the bars are really crowded. Stevie is Mr. Big down there he recruits all his waiters from there. Right before we went into the Cock Ring I took my outer black formal pants off and went in my jeans underneath. It was jammed with cute kids dancing. Then Stevie gets bored right away everywhere and wants to leave. Went to 12 West and I would not dance so Stevie danced with a pillow. He kept getting poppers and putting them under my nose. Bob Weiner saw Stevie holding the poppers and me sniffing and went out to the car. Later he said that his whole clean innocent image of me was blown that there I was on Quaaludes taking poppers and drinking. I said ""Did you actually see me take a Quaalude?"" Then I showed him the bits of the Quaalude still in my pocket and I informed him that I had not been inhaling when Stevie put the poppers under my nose. Then he said okay but that I was drinking and I said ""I always drink."" Then to the Anvil for a minute. There was a colored guy at the door who did not want to let Stevie in he started screaming that Stevie had not let him into Studio 54 and who did he think he was now trying to get into the Anvil but then he saw me and he waved me in and he finally let Stevie in too but he made him pay. Upstairs there was ""entertainment."" It was a drag queen. Richard Bernstein was there he told me that Valentino had ordered forty portraits from him then only took two. Remember he is the one who called Sophia Loren the cheapest person in the world for wanting a 70 percent discount! A part of the show that I did think was funny was a boy taking off fifty pairs of jockey shorts. Stevie said he had to get up at 8:00 because the restaurant meatman comes on Monday mornings and he has to pick out the meat. He lives in a new building on 55th Street. We got into the car and Stevie dropped me home and I kissed him in front of Bob Weiner so that Bob would have something else to write about. That was around 5:00."
"Sunday, September 25, 1983","[Andy Kaufman, Jay Shriver]",0.019127481713688603,"Woke up freezing. Went to church. Called Curley and he discouraged me from having dinner with him and his friends saying that it was a great night to stay home but that if I really wanted to come out they had reservations at this one place. So I could take a hint. Then I called Mark the kid from the Pedantiks and we arranged to meet at Texarkana. He said he was bringing the guy named Sam from his group. Then I called Jay Shriver and he said he would fallen asleep and just could not drag himself out that night so I said okay (cab downtown $6). Met Sam and Mark on the street on the way in. Anyway during dinner we talked about rock I guess. Mark has blond hair and he looks regular you would never think he was gay. Sam's teeth are bad and he looks grey but then I guess rock and roll is not healthy and these kids do start to look like that. We were there for a while and suddenly over walked Jay!he would been there for half an hour sitting at the bar and he thought I would seen him but actually I had not. And then after drinking he got too paranoid and decided to come over and face me. But I never would even have seen him. I can not see with my new contacts. I do not even know which ones I have got on. He was there to try to pick up the waitress he would seen the night before. I felt really mad at him because he would lied and said that he was not going out. I mean all he had to do was tell the truth. I mean I am not a kid (dinner $120). Called Benjamin a few times but he said he was tired because he would worked till 5:00 at the Pyramid Club as a drag queen. But Mark is a doorman at the Pyramid and he said they close before that so I do not know if Benjamin was lying to me too. So then dropped Mark and Sam off ($6) and when I got home I was just so mad at Jay and all these kids. I felt so used and abused and lied to. Watched a good TV show on HBO. For the first time I saw why Andy Kaufman was funny so clever. He had a plant in the audience saying ""You do not do anything new-the same old routine for ten years"" and then the guy is yelling the lines with him and then Andy Kaufman really starts to sweat and you do not know if it is real or not. It was very very good. Talked to Jon in Los Angeles."

I am seeing Lincoln Kirstein's name in all these Anne Bass articles and gee I would really like to do a good interview with him myself. These old guys will pop off soon and they are so interesting. I went over to his house once on 19th Street. Jamie Wyeth took me.

Went to 86th and Third to Doyle's for the joint auction of Louis Armstrong's stuff and James Beard's. It was weird the two different lives put together and every little whisk and pot and piece of sheet music was for sale with people hovering over them. I am surprised they do not do it right there in the apartments. Bought two catalogues ($20).

Fred had to lie and say that I was a cripple so that the driver would take us such a short distance. The driver looked me over and said ""Yes I can see that"" ($2). Pierre showed us his birthday present to Yves: a sixteenth-century vermilion lion with ruby eyes. Yves also had on a lion ring. I taped the entire lunch. They spoke a lot of French so we stared around a lot. After lunch we went to the garden and the dogs were let out and Pierre played with them. He told us that he uses a cock ring. Pierre said that they were putting silicone in cocks now so that they stayed hard all of the time. Yves said he hoped everyone would do it so he could design new pants."

Took a walk took pictures got back to the house. Halston was all dressed saying goodbye to us and we were shocked because we did not know what happened. Then Jon found out that Halston's mother had died. Halston kept it a secret all through dinner last night he acted as if nothing happened but he told Victor to tell us after he left. We had a really good talk with the senator. Robert Redford's his best friend. he is keeping his romance secret because it is only forty days left till his divorce. Bianca is all over him (dinner $120 with tip).

Got up we had to have breakfast downstairs with the owner Mr. Sopher and his wife-Donald and Carol. I would done her portrait two days before and I was a little late and when I came they were all there two tables full of all these chic and exciting people. You had to walk the line the buffet but it was really really good food-salmon you could have scrambled eggs with anything they had roast beef and bagels and cream cheese and lox. I do not know why they spent so much money doing the food but it was really good. Ron Feldman was there. Talked to the owner and he reminded me he was from Pittsburgh or McKeesport. He owned this whole empire 800 acres of swamp that he made into this great place. Signed a lot of autographs and did interviews. It was just exhausting. Went back to the hotel and watched Stage Door with Ann Miller and Katharine Hepburn and that was better than watching the tennis matches because I can not stand watching anyone who might lose.
"Thursday, April 10, 1980","[Ara Gallant, Carly Simon, Hugh Downs, Jodie Foster, Kitty Miller, Larry Rivers, Susan Strasberg, Walter Steding]",0.06464793281653748,"They were going to film me for another ABC show Omnibus-they are reviving it-and the car was picking me up at 10:00. The Omnibus people arrived at the office at 7:30 they would worked it all out with Vincent the day before. This was a show on Carly Simon getting her portrait painted by me and by Larry Rivers and by Marisol. I would said that I would not do one more thing without being paid and Vincent worked out a contract with them-Carly was going to pay for most of it. I was in the limo alone and we went down the West Side Highway. I had a camera with me because I have decided to take pictures everywhere I go to prove that I really do go to all these places every day. The windows of the car were black so to do it I had to roll them down. A few people on the West Side Highway said ""Hi Andy."" Then we got off the highway at 23rd Street and this black kid said ""You filthy white rich person all you think about is money."" And there were a few of them and I got scared. Fred told me later that I should have screamed back ""All you think about is money! And mugging to get it."" And they kept following the car. It scared me so much. I got to the office and they wired me and sent the car back for Carly Simon. Carly was too nervous to come up until we sent some wine down to the car. Then she came up and was sociable. We made her put on lipstick and then after we worked she was hungry and we sent to Brownies for health sandwiches and she loved that. I taped it all (Brownies $8.30 $23.44). And then Ara Gallant came with Susan Strasberg and she twisted Bob's arm to interview her she is just written a book. At 6:00 Jodie Foster came to 860. She looked beautiful. With her mother. She and her mother are a team. it is like a marriage-Jodie's the father. she is very intelligent and she is gotten into all the colleges she is applied to except she hears from Harvard Yale and Princeton on Monday. In case she goes to Harvard we were telling her about John Samuels and how cute he is but I do not know what type she would like because she dresses really like a boy-all in Brooks Brothers. While we were there Brigid called the restaurant to say that the 20/20 segment on me had just been on TV and she said it was great. Hugh Downs narrated it. And Brigid's so critical of me so I was relieved. I mean if even she could not find anything wrong with it it must have been okay. they are selling Kitty Miller's everything. Christie's is. I mean her used underwear her used potholders everything. She has (laughs) three unused Halston shirts. And she is got a few Revillon furs that cost $80000 that'll probably go for $3000. Furs have no resale value ... I know killing animals to make coats is sad but look even when you think about killing cows to eat they are so big and beautiful and everything's alive-the plants are screaming. I am still weighing 140 I do not understand it I am not eating that much my metabolism must have changed. I should be 136. But now I am eating the nuts and chocolate and things that I am not supposed to eat because of my gallbladder because I think the gallbladder pills are helping so that I can eat them. But I am getting fat so for that reason I will have to stop. Walter Steding is performing at the Squat Theater on 23rd Street-that theater where they did that thing called ""Andy Warhol's Last Tape."""

And he had all this made-up stuff in it like that Edie was giving a blow job to somebody and also eating a girl's pussy which would never be true. And then he said that Tennessee just loved Joe Dallesandro so when Joe went up to see him Tennessee did his fainting number so Joe would have to hold him in his arms. God I just always thought Dotson Rader was a CIA person. Just that creepy type. And now he is gone from the Carters to walking Pat Lawford. I mean how we met him in like '69 was he took Blowjob up to screen at Columbia where he said he was going to school. But even then he looked too old to be a student so it always made me wonder. Lidija came by and I am all out of shape after not working out for the two weeks in California. And there is a radiologist in the building next door to me. He just bought a million-dollar machine and they had to knock a wall out to get it in and I keep wondering if the radium stuff can get to me because we share steam heat. Everybody says the machines are ""foolproof."" Sure. And the Polish Embassy next door now they want $4 million for it. I guess I should have bought it when then were asking $1.3. Had to leave early cabbed to Radio City Music Hall ($6). The guy writing the book on Liberace was next to us and he said that Liberace was really in love with that chauffeur who gave all the interviews to the National Enquirer and that it really crushed him-Scott Thorsen. Now he has a new chauffeur. And the show is just magnificent. A rhinestone cape that shined to the stars. Lots of gay jokes and dirty jokes and he has all these little kids who are his proteges who play the piano while he goes on a break. And the little boys he introduces as ""my dear little friend my best little friend ..."" but not the little girls. And he showed a film of his fingers and talked about each ring."

And Brigid took Richard home with her and gave him $25 to clean the stove and then she spent all night eavesdropping while he made plans on the phone to go to Studio 54 arranging to have his brother iron his light green pants-Robert irons for Richard because that is the only thing he does really well. he is the twin who lived with Rupert and left Rupert for Fred. And Truman came down to the office. He loved the new title for our photo book Over-Exposed. Bob got that title out in California when he talked to Irving Mansfield. I like the title Social Disease better though because if we are not going to be commercial anyway we might as well always be something that people will avoid. Truman's facelift is the first one I have ever seen that really did work. His chins are totally gone and they were just hanging there for years. The only thing that is wrong is that the scar over his nose is still two inches thick. I think that one was a mistake. Since the operation he wears a piece of plastic over it and he could have just (laughs) done that in the first place. Oh and Truman asked for the originals of his articles back and we were trying to keep them. I will try to give him a Xerox. Cabbed back to the office ($3) and everyone was waiting for me. Lloyd called the Mafia-type kid who worked at 54 and he wanted to have dinner with Catherine and me. He said to meet him at a place called York's on 38th and Second (cab $4). York's was a funny little place. Then we dropped Catherine and cabbed to Regine's ($3). I think he had a Rolls Royce parked near York's but I do not think he wanted us to see it. He said he wanted to meet Regine but when we got to Regine's he knew everybody. He knows everybody everyplace and it is so strange he is so young-eighteen-but he acts like forty. I had half a drink and he had three more. Then he told me he was bi. And that got me scared because I always thought he was after Catherine but then I did not know. He told me about his family. He said his father works for Roy Cohn but he sounded more like a money collector to me. He said his ""pop"" gets up at 6:00 and goes to the post office every morning to pick up the money that is come in from the debts he makes people pay up on. He has a seven-year-old sister that will be a beauty he says-he buys her presents. Regine's husband came by and I introduced them. Then he did not charge us. And then Lloyd still wanted to drink some more so he said why do not we go to the Playboy Club so that sounded like fun. He likes Bunnies. He has a philosophy about women-he only likes them if they are very beautiful. he is Jewish and I asked him why he was not home for Passover and he said they are not religious. At the bar three guys were staring at me but it turned out they worked at ""21."" It was strange. Lloyd had two more drinks. He said that his mother is beautiful-she is only thirty-eight-and that she never wears a dress twice or shoes either. He wants to take us to a really great restaurant in Westchester. He said ""it is better than Elaine's."" is not that funny? Of all the places to pick. ""Better than Elaine's"" he said. ""If you do not think it is as good as Elaine's I will take you to dinner for a year but you have to be honest."" Oh and Steve Rubell got taken to jail. It has not been in the news yet. It was for fighting with some photographers. Lloyd said the only time Steve ever hurt him was when Steve was on Quaaludes and Lloyd said ""Gee Stevie I am glad you like my mom and pop"" and Steve said ""I do not. they are nothing. they are nobodies-it is you I like."" He said that really hurt him. This was when he was driving Steve home once."
"Thursday, April 12, 1984","[Jean Michel Basquiat, Robert Hayes]",-0.010185185185185186,Jean Michel Basquiat came by. he would been out all night. Got him to work on one of our joint paintings. He wanted spaghetti so we got some from La Colonna ($71.45). He fell asleep and then he got up and he was up front by the phones with a big hard-on like a baseball bat in his pants. I guess that is being young I forget about those things. Gael's been doing double work since Robert Hayes has been out. And the kids say that they think it is mental with him more than anything but that when they go over to see him he is actually coughing. And three weeks is a long time to have a cold is not it?
"Thursday, April 13, 1978",[Marc Balet],0.3147727272727273,"Interview lost the Halston centerfold ad maybe. For weeks someone's been telling me it is on the way and then yesterday they called and said they did not know anything about it so we do not know. Victor's so out of touch with the Halston house now. Stevie is Halston's new best friend -he is over there every night instead of going to work at Studio 54. Victor always said that you did have to watch Halston-that he could turn on you-that you had to stay more unattainable and that would make it more glamorous for him. The best thing that happened was a kid arrived with a singing telegram for Marc Balet's birthday but Marc was not there yet so they came to get me to show me. He had a red uniform and it said ""The Singing Messenger."" I asked him for a free sample and he sang ""I am So Glad You Came Out of the Closet Today"" which he said is one of their most popular songs so that was funny."
"Thursday, April 14, 1983","[Isabel Eberstadt, Peter Martin]",0.1994949494949495,"-New York-St. Martin And I started the Isabel Eberstadt novel and the names sounded phony so I only got ten pages into it and I stopped. Easy ride arrived (cab $10) in St. Martin at the Hotel La Samanna. it is the most beautiful place ever. Blue and white. So Jon Chris Peter and I had a house Villa ""M"" and checked in and ordered pina coladas. I applied sun block and left it on the whole time. Dinner at the hotel was really grand overlooking the balcony. You feel like a tourist the first day but then other people arrive after you and you feel like a veteran. Peter Martins the dancer was there he said hi (dinner $214.45)."
"Thursday, April 16, 1981","[Jon Gould, Lou Reed]",0.0867673992673993,Got up early and it looked beautiful out but I am in this period where I think What is it all about? You do this and what does it mean and you do that and what does it mean? Really I am in a strange period I put off telling the Diary about my emotional problems because last Christmas when I was having all the fights with Jed and he moved out I could not face talking about it and now I am living alone and in a way I am relieved but then I do not want to be by myself in this big house with just Nena and Aurora and Archie and Amos. I have got these desperate feelings that nothing means anything. And then I decide that I should try to fall in love and that is what I am doing now with Jon Gould but then it is just too hard. I mean you think about a person constantly and it is just a fantasy it is not real and then it gets so involved you have to see them all the time and then it winds up that it is just a job like everything else so I do not know. But Jon is a good person to be in love with because he has his own career and I can develop movie ideas with him you know? And maybe he can even convince Paramount to advertise in Interview too. Right? So my crush on him will be good for business. Oh and the most interesting thing was seeing Lou Reed on the street in the Village with his wife. she is nothing special just a little sexy girl. I told him that I would just been reading about him in People and I asked him why he does not come over and see us and he said it is because he does not know any of the people anymore and then he asked if Ronnie was still around and I said yes and then if Vincent was still around and I said yes and if PH was still around and I said yes so it was funny. Went home. I cooked an early Easter dinner and it smelled like the old days when PH used to come up and cook me cabbage with caraway seeds and onions. Jon was a little late because he had to go to Macy's to return some sheets. He brought me an Easter basket it was kind of plain. I gave him a tour of the whole house to impress him and I was hinting like crazy that it could all be his that there was a room with his name on it. Then we went to see Excalibur. The sex scenes were a little corny but beautifully done. He had his armor on when they were having sex. And then the focus was so soft. And I was so confused I always thought Camelot was a real place. So after the movie we walked back home. I would given Jon a rabbit puppet and he was waving at people with it. he is going to his family's house in Massachusetts for Easter.
"Thursday, April 19, 1979","[Ron Galella, Steve Rubell]",0.1,Had to go to the memorial service for Ambassador Hoveyda's brother who was executed in Iran. Cabbed to Riverside Drive ($2.50). Everybody was there. We took our shoes off. There was a rug in the middle of the floor and no one wanted to step on it because it was like stepping on the body because there was not a body there. There was Iranian music. It was like the best cocktail party but with no drinks. Steve Rubell's suing Ron Galella I read in the papers-for starting a fight at Studio 54 he says. And I am invited to Ron Galella's wedding on Saturday. I think I will go.

Late that night Christopher encouraged me to call Jon Gould in California so I did it was 5:00 there and I was pretending to be sober so I had this great sober voice which I do not know how I did it and the secretary said that he was in a meeting and he would be out in fifteen minutes and he would be sure to call me and then she asked if it was all right to call me ""Andy"" because I was her god and she was so familiar that I just knew something was wrong I knew he would never call back. But I sat around waiting for the call and I must have dozed off but I am sure the phone never rang. And then Fred arrived and he brought a whole gang with him and it sounded like they were rowdy Frenchmen they had these horrible voices and I did not know who they were and they just went on and on and on and Fred played ""Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"" at top volume and I thought I would freak out. I was feeling so desperate because my phone call never came through that I almost wanted to kill myself. that is the way life goes kiddo. Fred's friends did not leave until 4:00 in the morning. I looked out the window when I heard them going and they did not look so great to me but Fred said that they were rich kids."

Jade asked us if we wanted something to drink and we said ""Two vodkas on the rocks"" and she said to the Spanish maid ""Dos vodkas con heilo."" I wanted her to sing and so she did ""Frere Jacques"" and I asked her to sing ""Satisfaction"" and she would never heard of it. She sang ""Ring Around the Roses"" but she said ""Tissue tissue all fall down."" I asked her to make up a song about her day and she started to sing: ""I invited another child at school to come for dinner/ But they would not come/They think we are crazy/But they are crazy."" Bianca came down in a white cotton skirt and blue blouse but then looked at us dressed so formal and went back up and put on a gold and black lame dress and gold shoes. As we were leaving Jade said ""Now Andy Warhol I want you to visit more often."" Then she kissed everyone but she forgot about Bianca and Bianca said ""What about me?"" and Jade crawled over on the floor and kissed her too. Cabbed to 141 Prince Street. Very fancy loft building. I got jealous that I did not buy more buildings down there when they were cheap-lots of them."
"Thursday, April 22, 1982","[Lauren Hutton, Peter Beard, Ron Feldman]",0.1829274891774892,Halston's show was great the simple wonderful clothes he does. And he used ten or twelve girls. He had this new fabric that is beautiful that is like paper and silk and people were feeling it to see what it was. It came in gunmetal grey and gunmetal green and like with a waterfall through it like iridescent. And studs everywhere lots of studs. Lauren Hutton was next to me and she was using the same camera that I use but she was shooting from the hip and I told her that she would never get a picture unless she looked through it and put the circle in the right place. She said was not it great we were Montauk neighbors now-she and Halston and Peter Beard's brother bought 100 acres and she and Halston are going to divide up the land and build on it. Discussed the Extinct Animals portfolio with Ron Feldman.
"Thursday, April 24, 1980","[Carly Simon, Diana Vreeland, Henry Geldzahler, John Reinhold, Larry Rivers]",0.13253205128205126,"Got up at 8:00 because Vincent said we had to be at the TV studio at the dot of 9:00 for the ABC thing on Carly Simon where Larry Rivers and Marisol and I had to show our portraits of her. We went over there and then Larry and Marisol arrived by limousine. We met the director who had a phony high-class accent. Larry was fun. He decided to make the director work and said ""Where should I stand? What should I say? How should I look? What should I think?"" and things like that. I think Carly liked my portrait the best because she is paying for it. I only had one there but Larry had five and one of his had a Chinese couple fucking in the background and they made him take it out. And then afterwards they wanted to shoot us in front of blank easels listening to Carly and Larry said no that he would submitted to what they wanted by taking the fucking couple out so he would not do this corny thing. Then Larry and Marisol came to the office for lunch. Marisol was cute. She invited me to her fiftieth birthday party at Chanterelle that very chic small restaurant downtown but she said not to tell anybody it was her fiftieth. Worked till 8:00. John Reinhold picked me up. Henry Geldzahler came and met us we discussed the poster some more and then cabbed ($2.50) to dinner at Da Silvano on Sixth Avenue. It was good but it was not as good as the first time we were there (dinner $98.40). The owner went out and bought the Times because Henry had a half-page interview with him in it and he was afraid it was going to say something unfavorable but it did not. Then we walked to the Ninth Circle because Henry wanted some interludes. The place was filled with intellectual fairies who wanted to talk to me about my art but Henry told them I was too dumb to do it. Henry thought of a good quote about Popism: ""it is a real can opener."" is not that great? Oh and I am forgetting the most glamorous thing of the day is that Jackie O. called me twice at home and missed me and once at the office about would I give a quote for Diana Vreeland's book Allure that is coming out that is pictures with captions. She said ""it is like your book Exposures"" or something like that."
"Thursday, April 24, 1986",[Edmund Gaultney],0.012628600823045268,"Brigid came rushing into the middle of the Fiorucci lunch and I do not know what was wrong with her-she had this gold bracelet and she said ""I got the guy on the street down from $60 to $40."" And I just looked at her and said ""Are you serious?"" She said ""Look it is got 14K in four places."" And Jay laughed and asked her ""Was it a black guy?"" and she said yes. And I said ""do not you know that they just sit there on the street with a little stamper machine and stamp on the 14Ks?"" And she would not believe us and I told her to go to the jewelry store on the corner and ask the guy. I bet her $5 and then when she came back from the place she sent $5 upstairs to me because the jeweler just looked at it and said ""No."" I did not want the money though-I just wanted her to have it tested. And Jay was wearing a suit. He looks nice when he wears a tie and jacket but then you can not ask him to do anything. I called Rupert to find out where he was and he said Edmund Gaultney was rushed to St. Vincent's. He just came back from Taos. He was going to move there. I do not know why he was taking these plane trips you really pick up viruses on planes. Like he went to Key West before. And they thought he would had a heart attack but it was an epileptic seizure. Now he is in a coma."
"Thursday, April 25, 1985",[Lucio Amelio],0.006380208333333335,Dr. Bernsohn says he does not want to be associated just with crystals because he could lose his license-he said that in Massachusetts people have lost their licenses. But I mean if you really believe in something it seems kind of funny if you will not take the consequences. I am trying to find another store that sells the sculpture of the Last Supper that is about one-and-a-half feet-they are selling it in one of those import stores on Fifth near Lord & Taylor but it is so expensive there about $2500. So I am trying to find it cheaper in Times Square. I am doing the Last Supper for lolas. For Lucio Amelio I am doing the Volcanoes. So I guess I am a commercial artist. I guess that is the score.
"Thursday, April 28, 1983","[Bob Colacello, Perry Ellis]",0.4139285714285714,Cabbed to the Perry Ellis fashion show ($5.50) and right as we walked in we ran smack in to Bob Colacello.

Fred and I had a big fight about the makeup person and he had to go out to cool off. Then he came back. Jane Fonda had her own hairdresser and her own makeup person with her and she was on crutches and she was oh-so-charming because she was wanting something free. Really charming. She asked about Geraldine Smith and Eric Emerson who she and Vadim once took back to their hotel room with them after meeting them at the Factory. I told her Eric was in heaven and Geraldine was in the phone book. I had Brigid stitching away on the new sewing machine I bought because I want to sew my photographs together but then it turned out that the best sewer is my bodyguard the ex-Marine Agosto because he worked in a sweatshop in Hawaii before he went into the marines.
"Thursday, April 3, 1986",[Maria Shriver],0.3278273809523809,"Went right downtown because Maria Shriver was coming at 11:00 (cab $5). And she is really pretty and she took good pictures. she is a little heavy on the bottom. She was cute she talked a lot. Paige and I wanted chocolate on the way home so we stopped at Neuchatel and they gave us free quarter-pound bags and we just walked up Madison eating it. Dr. Li gave Paige some flower-water stuff and after she eats the candy she is supposed to say ""I love what I just did but I will not do it again"" and then drink the purple Flowers of Providence."

I got shoved in a room and a fat lady made me take off all my clothes. So then Janet came in and said ""This young lady will do you"" and this young lady was about sixty-five. She put a hot towel on me and it was like heaven. Janet looks good-her face is pretty-but she has a lot of crow's feet. And I think it is because she believes in astringent-I am sure that dries it out. She told me she does Bianca and I said ""Bianca has the greatest skin"" and she said ""that is my skin!"" Nena and Aurora's brother Agosto came down to the office the one who is small and adorable who was a Marine. Vincent talked to him about a job. Went home then picked up Jon (cab $4 tickets $60) and went to the Minskoff. At Can Can we had good seats in the same row as Ethel Merman. I told Ethel I wanted to see her back up there. And then we ran into Donald Trump and the dollar-a-year man for the city who has the building company Walsh and their wives. And it was so much fun to see Donald Trump again so soon in a different place. And I chit-chatted with the Czechoslovakian wife and Jon Gould chit-chatted with Trump. I love going out with Jon because it is like being on a real date-he is tall and strong and I feel that he can take care of me. And it is exciting because he acts straight so I am sure people think he is. When I got home there was a note from Jenette Kahn to call her when I got in no matter what time so I did and she said Sharon Hammond was getting married to her lord the next day at 5:00 and I was invited to the reception from 6:00 to 12:00."

Then we went back to the hotel to meet Lana. And she was adorable to me. She was tipsy and it was like a whole different person. I closed my eyes and it was like being with Paulette that kind of attitude. She said ""Give me a kiss."" And Lana does crystals too. And she had a cracked rib which she blamed on a Nolan Miller dress she had that made her trip but I think she must have been drunk. She wears a little quarter-inch cross. Oh and on The Love Boat the last day Andy Griffith suddenly got really happy very friendly to everybody and nobody could figure it out after he would been so bitter all week. He must have had a drink."

Or his boyfriend. Or their boyfriend I do not know how that one works. Neil and Leba Sedaka and their two little boys walked in and Paloma fell madly in love with Neil. She said when she was ten in Argentina that they used to sing ""Sweet Sixteen"" in Portuguese and Spanish and then she sang it for Neil that way and he loved it he was so impressed with her. And Regine was cute she now has a ""back room."" Everybody wants one just like Studio 54 has-Xenon copied it too-but as usual Regine has it all wrong. Hers is too big and too plush and too far away from everything."

He was giving me these very calm low-key stock answers repeating them to me like ""I have got a grip on it"" and ""it is under control"" and things like that and I told him ""Oh do not give me that."" So then when he started asking me questions I decided to just give him his own medicine and that is what I started telling him ""it is in my control...."" And Gael Love said that Doria and Ron have gotten an apartment in L.A. and that Ron's going to be getting $6000 for articles he writes so they would not be doing anything more for us. Maura came by and made 14000 calls to L.A. The New Show folded and she is going out there and wants to get to Barry Diller's party. And she was saying ""If you have any stocks sell them all because with this national deficit I mean ..."" And she just says what her father tells her. So I guess Senator Moynihan wants everybody to panic. The press had called a while ago and asked what did I think about Campbell's soup having new plastic cans the crushable kind and I said ""Oh yeah sure great idea great great!"" So now I just got the cutest letter from a person at Campbell's soup saying ""I am so glad that you agree with us that we needed a new look."" I should have said ""And I am going to get a new wig."""

Doc Cox brought them in his Rolls Royce. Then Billy Kluver and Julie Martin and Lucy Jarvis came up. They brought a Negro guy named Chris who they want to back a musical of my life (coffee $.76 $1.89). Fred had invited Regine and Diana Vreeland had had a lunch date with Regine so she came along too. Diana did not know who Doc Cox was so she thought he was the one to be nice to so (laughs) she missed the point. She kept asking Regine ""Tell me why am I being nice to this man?"" Billy Kluver had told me that Chris was a ""scientist"" but it did not seem like it. He was fascinating. He started at seventeen whatever he does. He told me about owning beachfront property in California. He said he had a coffee business in Brazil but I do not know it sounded like smuggling. I mean a couple of good cocaine loads and you have made a few million. He looks so young and anything you mention he is ""thinking of buying it."" He said he wanted to buy Radio City Music Hall and turn it into the world's largest discotheque. That would be such a great idea. New York needs the world's biggest discotheque. Then Tom Sullivan arrived and this Chris made Tom seem like peanuts. Then Gianni Agnelli came in and Chris said he was thinking of buying Fiat so I went over to where Gianni was talking to Regine and Diana and said that I had a buyer for Fiat and his ears perked up. The two of them went over into a corner but then (laughs) Gianni left really fast. Then Tom Sullivan pissed on some paintings for me and left. Doc Cox was thrilled talking to Regine and Diana and then meeting Gianni Agnelli."

Cabbed up to the Sherry Netherland with Bob to interview Sissy Spacek for Interview ($4). We brought copies of the Carroll Baker Interview with us. Carroll's name is spelled wrong on the cover. Sissy's mother was there and she said hello and went into the other room to read Interview and then Bob got nervous because he thought Sissy was fifteen and her mother would see the nude photograph we ran of Yul Brynner when he was young-that famous old photo. But Sissy's really twenty-seven and she is married her mother was just with her not chaperoning her. we are going to have to research better. she is Czech from a Czechoslovakian town in Texas which I would never heard of. And I could not believe it when she said she would been an extra in the ""crowd"" scene in our movie Women in Revolt -the bar scene that we filmed in Paul Morrissey's basement on East 6th Street-and she said she was also in the background singing on that Lonesome Cowboys theme song record that Bob Goldstein wrote and Eric Emerson sang!

He said Keith Richards wants to buy Patti Hansen a ruby and wants to know where to get it appraised but really any place might switch a stone on you. The only one I was sure would not is John Reinhold. Because it happened to him in San Antonio-somebody switched a stone in what he would sold them and then said that he would done it and so there would not be trouble he paid. Because you can never prove it. And even the reputable places I think do it. Where it really happens is at auctions. You take it over in a corner and look at it and you can switch it. Benjamin picked me up and we went over to meet Paige Powell at Dino De Laurentiis's big store on Columbus (cab $3). I told the manager I knew Dino and he took us to the basement and through the kitchen area which is a block long. I asked them what they do with the leftovers and they said they have poorhouses who come and take them. But I would think the employees take most of it. Do you think at the poorhouses they are eating pate de foie gras? And there was a lady cutting pasta as if it were a dress really big. Then we went to Salou florist. Gave an Interview to a cop. Went to Charivari across the street. I was dropped off by Benjamin and Jay ($5). Met Chris Peter and a friend of theirs who raises money for Democratic candidates he makes a thousand a week doing that. His last candidate lost. He said the wife of the guy would put on her diamonds and her designer dresses to go into the poor neighborhoods because she wanted him to lose-she did not want to leave town and go to Washington. And she would say ""I know how it must hurt all you poor people to see us come down here in our rich clothes..."" He said she was nuts. He told me that they have a machine that puts stamps on letters crooked because then you get a better response-more homey."
"Thursday, April 9, 1981",[Jon Gould],0.1492845117845118,"-Vienna Bruno came by because we had a really punctual meeting at 10:30 at the ministry with the lady Minister of Culture in Vienna. We met the curator of my Reversals show at the Vienna Museum of Twentieth-Century Art I forget his name and we saw the beautiful catalogues that they printed for the Reversal show which are really long and slim. Then we went to the hotel and freshened up before the show at 6:00. I talked to Vincent in New York and he said my headsheet had come in from Zoli. Have I told the Diary I have decided to become a male model? So then Fred got so overwrought-he thinks I am crazy to start modeling. But it is something I want to do so I ignored him. Chris said Fred's just jealous. So we got to the museum and it was an unbelievable crush open to the public and I would never been in Vienna before so this was ""See Andy now or you will never see him again."" And that lasted for two hours and I had to sign shoes and asses and I did not even look up once. Then finally Christopher could not stand it anymore and said that we had to leave so we ran out past all the TV people and jumped into the car and it took us to a Viennese restaurant where we had hot dogs. Then to a great club called Chaca-all young good-looking kids. Tangos and old Elvis songs and it was just the greatest. Chris and I took this adorable boy Martin back to the hotel. We got him to take his shirt off and then we got him to take his pants off too and he had the craziest sort of Op Art underwear on and we took pictures and he did the best poses and then we gave him the car to go home in. One thing I have learned from Chris is that if you tell anybody to do anything they just do it. Especially models and actors. And then I saw a Telex from Jon Gould he is back in New York and it was a really nice note and then I felt great."

Went to Orso's right next door and Marion Javits walked in with Gil Shiva. And they had La Cage aux Folles programs and so did everybody in the place and we had to hide our Mame programs because we were embarrassed.

She said her father was going to be there and I think she was afraid of me being there with her father. I waited for Rupert to come in with the positives. I saw that in my photographs that came back from the printer there were some personal pictures of Rupert's vacation in Jamaica. I guess he sends his own pictures in to be developed with mine but I am not going to give them to him they are pictures of him carrying on. Jon went to the country for the whole weekend.

I gave them Interviews. Then I remembered the Mondale kid that I would invited him. Liz Carpenter was there a camp she had her hair Bo Derek-style just beads in it. She wanted me to give an art education lecture to the Secretary of Education. I forgot to say that I keep running into the Robb girl the LBJ daughter the tall one. Lynda Bird. She could be a raving beauty but she does not want to be I guess because she wears glasses and a funny hairdo. Liz Carpenter brought about eight people. Nancy Dickerson was there. And Wilson Kidde brought his friend from Princeton Matt Salinger the son of J.D. Salinger who we have been trying to get for Interview but he turned us down. He said it would just get too complicated to give an interview and it was just easier not to. he is really good-looking. And William Blair called and could not come to lunch and said that his father did not want him to be in Interview and we can not understand it. Lunch was for Pat Ast and we stuck her next to the Salinger boy so she had a good time. I gave a speech and I gave out Philosophy books. I told them I did not believe in art that I believed in photography. Oatsie Charles was there and she gave me a Mondale scarf. And little William Mondale was cute he stayed through the whole thing. I asked him about the Secret Service and he said they cramp his style. he is so pretty.
"Thursday, August 14, 1986",[Candy Pratts],0.196875,I originally stopped eating meat to see if I was allergic and I was not but now I just do not eat it much because I did not miss it. Candy Pratts came by the office she was really upset about Way Bandy she would been with him the week before and said he looked great. there is a rumor that he drank Clorox to commit suicide. But I saw him once on TV talking about he always washed his food in Clorox so do you think that is how the rumor got started?

We could not get the go-ahead because of storms in the areas we would be flying through. And then Diane Keaton had a fight with the stewardess she wanted to get off the plane and they would not let her because they were finally second in line and the captain by the end almost was crying and saying it was his worst experience and that he was not going to turn it around at this point to let them off. And Steve Rubell had a big fight with the stewardess. Not while we were on the ground because he did not want to get thrown off but as soon as we were in the air he started ""You bitch give me your name."" It was Pan Am. Finally we got to L.A. at about 1:30 and went to the Beverly Hills Hotel."

The Scull kid called and yelled at me for messing up his limousine the last time for spilling soda. Chris called and said that Peter's mother wanted to adopt Brian I mean ... Keith Haring came by with his black boyfriend and I took pictures. They were so lovey-dovey in the photos it was nutty to see. The big chalk drawing of a pregnant woman on 53rd and Fifth that we thought was his-it turns out it is and we are trying to get it. He did it a while ago. Picked up Cornelia and Sean McKeon and Maura in the limo to drive out to Shea Stadium to see the Police and Cornelia had hundreds of sandwiches and champagne. The rain came down in buckets. Ron Delsener was there and I guess he wants to be in society because he was smooching Cornelia and Maura. Francois de Menil came in with Laverne of Laveme and Shirley. And Cornelia just goes in and out. She falls asleep on your arm she just passes right out and then she wakes up and has this energy. Sting came over and said hello he looked a little old. He was with a girl I think it was his wife. And Matt Dillon! Matt Dillon was there. Oh he is so good-looking. And the girls finally by the time it was time to go had just gotten to the point where they were talking to him and they did not want to go. We may get him for a cover after all. Left dropped everyone. My sister-in-law just called. She said that she came by my house last night right when it started raining. So I guess I just missed her. And she said she is stopping by today but I told her I am not going to be there.

At home I started watching Brief Encounter and at first I thought it was really good but then I started thinking what a stupid story about a lady who would give herself a problem when she had a happy marriage and it was just dumb and I hated it. And then Lisa Rance called and asked if I would watched it and was not it beautiful so I told her off and hung up on her.

And we had to work on Ron Feldman to give us money and finally he said that when the paintings were finished he would and I really can not stand doing this show at Ron Feldman's it is just publicity for his gallery and he should be paying a lot more. Marlon Jackson came down and he brought T-shirts and was so cute. He was supposed to be coming to get a portrait but he did not know how to bring it up and I did not know either. We really want to get Michael on the cover of Interview. Marlon looks like fifteen but then he said he has a wife and three kids and she is expecting another."

Renny the flower person sent a birthday boy from his place wrapped in cellophane in a box who gave roses to Suzie. Lester tried to take the cellophane off. Tommy Pashun sent an orchid plant. The whole thing was over by about 3:00 and Suzie took everything from the table home-the chocolates and the flowers. Then Tommy Pashun had to get the orchid back from her because they send you the orchids but you do not get to keep them they are rare and the florist picks them up after you have had them and takes them back to the solarium. Then the next day they go on to somebody else.

I did not know it until we got there and it was nothing but faggots and lesbians. And I thought that for $40 tickets we would be in the orchestra but we were way up in the balcony because it was a benefit so the tickets downstairs were over $100 or something. And these gays you know they refuse Interviews and always pretend they do not know who you are and then they go home and dish you. These two dykes came over and said hello and I asked them what this event was all about and they said it was for the ""Islanders"" and I said ""The Islanders hockey team needs a gay benefit?"" and they laughed and said oh ha-ha no. And then Rupert nudged me that they were talking about Fire Island. They said ""how did you wind up here in the balcony?"" and I pointed at Rupert and said ""Because this creep brought me."" Anyway the play was so boring that I fell asleep a couple of times. But this audience this audience. I mean they just jumped up and laughed and applauded every single gay line-I mean anytime anybody referred to anything they clapped. And everyone had a mustache eight out of ten people there. Finally it ended and we got out of there. The two dykes asked me (laughs) ""Are you going to Cracker jacks? To the party?"" But all that was at night. In the morning Benjamin arrived and I was not ready. did not have enough Interviews to take around just had a couple. As we were walking on Madison between 66th and 67th Raquel Welch came bouncing out of a shop. She had on dark sunglasses so you almost did not recognize her. She said she was looking for a Napoleon bed. I gave her Dr. Karen's card for collagen. Fred likes the way my treatment looks and he is going to get it done. We were on Page Six because of our interview with Georgia O'Keeffe where she called Philip Johnson a minor architect and we left it in where I was saying that he is not now and she was saying that he was then and so since she can not see now she did not know. So I am bracing myself for a call from David Whitney. Fred says he is not going to drink that the other night was just too much. Got home and there was a note that Ara Gallant called. So I called him back and he said that Debra Winger and the governor of Nebraska were over there and he invited me over but it was so late that I did not want to go back out. Talked to Jon in L.A."

Lady Sharon said she has a Nautilus in her house and that we could use it. it is $20 an hour because a lady comes who shows you how to do it. We decided to get the building at Madison and 32nd. So that put me in a nervous state. I have to sign a letter and write a check and see what happens. Bob got Jon and me invited to Iris Love's birthday party at Barbetta's (cab $3). It was in the garden. I ran into Pauline Trigere and she said she still had not made a dress for me. Iris was wearing a toga with a towel around her head and Liz Smith was in a cowboy suit. Senator Ribicoff gave a speech. Diana Vreeland was there with Fred and she said I looked like a fourteen-year-old and she was thrilled about my modeling career. I met Iris's sister who has blonde hair now she had a crush on me twenty years ago and now she is divorced twice. It started to rain and they kicked us out of the garden. Then it stopped and they kicked us back in. And I was rude to Henry Geldzahler. He was there trying to get me to introduce him to someone and I ignored him I do not know why-well yes I do because Henry's hurt me so many times that way I just felt like it.

Fred's clipping out all the pictures of this Chambers kid who killed the girl in the park I do not know why. And he said he is rehiring Robyn Geddes! it is like hiring Brigid it will be another zombie. I mean if he was really recovered from his problems (laughs) he would not want to work for us anyway right? Fred said Robyn was ""the best worker"" he ever had. And Paige was upset because Fred criticized her about this thing she does during lunches when she gets nervous-she sort of leafs through the magazine-and she said that was her style of selling and if he was going to criticize it that in that case she just would not do lunches anymore. She said not to tell Fred she was upset but I did call Fred and reminded him that she sells more ads than anybody and he said that he had not said it in a bad way. Nick Rhodes called from London the other day and said they had a girl. I think he was disappointed. they are coming here in September. People from Denmark talked to Fred and want me to do a Hans Christian Andersen portfolio."

And when he gets that way he is so nutty. I was photographing Bob Colacello and Ronnie would take up the pictures and say ""Bob these are awful. You have three chins"" and Bob said ""No I do not I have lost two of them I look good today."" And it was true Bob did look good but Ronnie was going on picking up each one and saying how horrible it was. Brigid was depressed. Only Vincent was happy because some checks came in. Victor came by his hair was carrot blond and he was going to go for white to be like me but with dark eyebrows. he is been up for three days because he bought some good coke. I got back some of my pictures of Truman lying on the psychiatrist's couch. He looked like he does not have teeth in my pictures. Does he have teeth?"
"Thursday, August 30, 1979",[Barry McKinley],0.11607142857142858,Cabbed to Union Square ($3.60). Walked to the office. Made some phone calls had a little lunch. There was a crowd of models there that Barry McKinley was taking photographs of mostly male models they were so good-looking. Why are there so many to choose from now? Because there is nobody in the army? would not it be great to do a whole movie of nothing but good-looking kids-the butcher the baker-all models.

She was eating a banana and she could not even eat a banana. It was like she had no teeth. And Susan Pile told Jon that my birthday was actually August sixth and I would told him it was on the fifteenth because I thought I could get by it but now they are having a party I think. And I had big fights at the office. Somebody left food around and I was screaming and I told Paige Powell our Interview ad-seller to go and scream at whoever it was and it turned out to be this new kid at Interview who is just so cute and he is always nice and smiling to me and walks me to the corner to get my cab and stuff and so then I was embarrassed and I denied that I would told Paige to do it-I said that oh she must have just been on cocaine or something-and Robyn repeated the word ""cocaine"" to her and she went crazy and then I got mad at Robyn for telling her and he blamed it all on Jay and Jay said he did not do it and I was handing out pink slips like crazy and I screamed at Jennifer the new receptionist girl because I told her not to give me coffee in a coffee cup and she did she said there was nothing else there and I screamed that there were plenty of champagne glasses and why did not she bring it to me in one of those instead of a crummy old cup that everybody uses and God it was one of those days. And I introduced Robyn to Iolas I thought that might do the trick for Robyn's art career. Robyn's such a nice kid but he has no ambition and he does want to be an artist and so I thought that since Ronnie left and things worked out so well for him-his art career is doing really well -that maybe it could happen for Robyn too. So seventy-four-year-old Iolas grabbed Robyn's hand and was holding his palm. They say that you get energy from that and you do I think. So Iolas thought he would get Robyn's energy. But I was hoping Robyn would get his. Paul Morrissey is going off to Germany he is getting offers to do all the movies Fassbinder was supposed to do. They should ask me!"

Brigid had wanted the day off but I was Mr. Grump. I let everyone off five minutes early. And the funniest thing was that in the morning Brigid went to the delicatessen and over the radio the DJ said ""And happy birthday to Andy Warhol who is sixty-four years old today"" so she was laughing that they would even added eleven years on. John Reinhold sent me 500 carats of diamond dust for a present. it is like half a can of tomato soup-size. And he sent me twenty-seven roses. Diamond dust can kill you. it is a good way to murder somebody. Got a call from Hollywood. Jon did not remember my birthday which was great."

The house was just beautiful Whitney said it was designed by William Adams Delano. She had a whole room with murals done by Maxfield Parrish. Her sculptures were all around. Then we went next door to Whitney's grandmother's Mrs. Miller but she is in her eighties and she was ""resting"" so we just wandered around. Back to the city ($1). Stopped at Philip Johnson's apartment talked to David Whitney for an hour. he is working on the Jewish Museum project. He says the show should be plain with no gimmicks. But I think it should be funny I do not know I think the designer can really make a show interesting. But I guess the museum has no money to spend. Richard Weisman had invited me to meet Ann Miller Patti LuPone and Phil Esposito and him at ""21"" for dinner at 11:00. At ""21"" they looked at my bluejeans and they were about to say something but I rushed in fast. I finally talked Bob into putting Patti LuPone on the cover of Interview. she is so funny and Bob finally fell in love with her. All I could do was stare at Ann Miller. Her face is flawless. Not a wrinkle not even a smile line and she said ""One of these days I am going to have to get a facelift."" I do not think she has really because her skin is not pulled at all-her face is fat but it is unlined and not pulled. And she has tiny petite hands with long fingers. she is been married two and a half times-one was annulled. She said ""I married the richest Texans in the world but as soon as the marriages started the romance was over."" She was cute she ate like a Hollywood starlet on her first date-she had chicken hash. that is Hollywood style. And her nose is so fine so perfect it has to be a fake nose. Ann said that when she was at the bottom some people dropped her and now when those people send her flowers for Sugar Babies she writes back ""Thanks for nothing."" And the person who really did it the worst was Betsy Bloomingdale Bob's best friend. And she said that Denise Hale was ""trash."" And she is known Reagan for years but said she would not vote for him. But she is like me-after every putdown she says ""Oh but do not get me wrong Reagan's wonderful I just would not vote for him."" Bob walked me home and when we got to 66th Street there was a big fire across the street from me in front of the Ugandan building. A brand-new tree was burning because someone had set fire to the garbage underneath it and this whole family was sitting on the steps just watching the fire burn-it looked like Puerto Rico-and I just got furious-it looked like Africa-and they were just staring at this beautiful tree burning that was put in right when the one in front of my house was and they did not even call the fire department! And I do not understand because the doormen on the block must have seen it too and nobody was doing anything. So Bob and I went in and he called the fire department and they came in one second and put it out but I do not know if the tree will make it."

Tama's upset because Ronnie's gone back with Gigi and I kept slipping and bringing up Ronnie without meaning to. She seemed like she was holding up well but then later she broke down and said she was still so in love that she did not know what to do and I told her that she was so talented and pretty and that she had everything and I did not know why Ronnie would leave her to go back to a really awful person like Gigi and she said she was thrilled to hear me say that. I told her she had to get over her romance and just use it for material to write about.

Went to the movies with Keith and Bobby Madonna's ex-boyfriend who is sort of Keith's friend now. I had to sign autographs and they were amazed that so many people yelled my name and would know an artist. I should have asked the people who yelled if they knew what I did for a living. All the blacks know me I must be in their consciousness. it is the white hair. It was almost empty in the theater but it should have been completely empty. This movie NeverEnding Story my God ... and it is a big hit in Germany. it is sort of my philosophy-looking for the nothingness. The nothingness is taking over the planet. It was like Alice in Wonderland and E.T. and ""Rumpelstiltskin."" Then afterwards Bobby knew all the places in the area because Madonna had taken him to all of them. So we went to Jezebel's and then Jezebel came over and she was this fancy black lady. And then in walked guess who? Mickey Rourke. Who PH just interviewed for the cover of Interview.

I wish I could figure out how in his mind he decides when he is going to and when he is not. Walked the streets and it was a nice vigorous walk. Stopped in at B. Altman's and it was so jammed for a change. For once it looked like they were really doing business and so many salespeople wanted to help me I had to get out of there. Corice Arman called about helping me get a French visa. I mean those French are so awful making only the Americans get them and they let everybody else in the world right in. The office was busy worked around there. It began to rain and snow and get really horrible out. I went to Liza's husband Mark Gero's opening at the Weintraub Gallery which is just a small gallery. Liza was upstairs getting photographed. Then I picked up Paige at 8:30 and we went over to Liza's apartment on East 69th Street for the party. And there was a big crowd. Halston was there and Calvin and Kelly and Steve Rubell. And Bob Colacello was really nice just saying how he would gotten so much training at Interview and how it did so much for his writing. He had the breath he gets when he drinks so I guess he is drinking again. Like champagne fermenting. Liza had people from Vogue and Details and Vanity Fair there so she was doing her best to publicize Mark's paintings. And the paintings used to look like sensual vaginas but now they look like they are having trouble. they are holes with blood around them and they have got names like ""Death of a Baby."" it is like Liza's life. And Steve Aronson was there and he was fun carrying on about how he did not get his Christmas bottle of champagne from Interview in 1977. And Ethel Scull was there and I said she should start living it up and she said she was going to soon. Ethel's either had too much of a facelift or else she is had a stroke I can not tell which. Paige and I talked about our blind-date dinner the night before and nobody made out except Steven Greenberg. Tama's date Amos and Archie's vet Dr. Kritsick did nothing but complain to her-that his book did not make money that his pipe had a leak in it-everything. And Paige's date overcomplimented her and mine well ... I think my dates on these things should be good talkers who can entertain the table because I do not talk and Paige does not talk and Tama does not and it gets so boring. I told Steve Aronson he should write the real Revlon story the story of the three Lachman wives-Ruth Rita and Jaquine-and he said that was a good idea. And Calvin and Halston were sitting on the same chair so cozy. It was odd and then Calvin said would not it be fun to go to Halston's a gas and so we all got into cars and we went over there and Dick Cavett came he was at the party with Bianca. And Bianca looked a little fat in the bottom but she said she was thin. And she was looking her age. I do not know what the age is but she was looking it."
"Thursday, December 12, 1985",[],0.02777777777777778,The Boston Museum returned the Electric Chair painting because they said the shade of red was off. It was slightly different and I told them that would make it more interesting but they still wanted to send it back for me to think about it. If they had it next to the black panel it would not matter anyway. I think they are just procrastinating. But it costs around $4000 every time you ship it somewhere with the insurance and everything. And Fred was going to Atlanta.

A cute guy was in the office a friend of Averil's and he did not know he would walked across the painting I would just done it was still wet. It was funny.

I decided to start drinking water instead of coffee. The office was busy. Vincent paid bills. Thomas Ammann showed a few paintings here at the house-Balthus Picasso from 1923 and Utrecht. And what should I do with these Christmas trees that Tommy Pashun sent? Five little ones. Last year all my trees died after I spent loving care on them spraying them with water and everything.

I called Fred to find out what it was about but he did not remember. I said I would be right down and it took twenty-five minutes (cab $5.50). He turned out to be Rie Ocasek from the Cars. they are from Boston and he has an earring and capped teeth and he is not really good-looking because he has dyed-black hair but he is sweet and as charming as David Bowie. Lunch was actually for Diane Lane who Ara Gallant was bringing down. she is fifteen and so beautiful. Then Bob was busy on the phone and we had to meet Doria and Ron and their friend Cal at the movie Flash Gordon on 53rd Street. They were in the next-to-the-last row with the Secret Service behind them. The movie was not really good but it was fun to watch. Then after the movie they went in their car and did not offer to take us so we got a cab up to the Gibbon restaurant to meet them. Those kids are not going to have any friends because it is just too scary being with them with all these big guys guarding them you think you are going to get bumped off. And the Secret Service rented a room from a lady in their building-her living room-and they sit in there and watch with the door open all the time. The Secret Service guys I guess do not like Japanese food because they just had coffee. Cal said our invitations for the inauguration had been sent out already and Bob asked Ron and Doria if we were invited to the right parties and they said they thought so. They said they were not going to go in a limousine they were going to try to rent an army truck. Bob said how it was easier to just go along in the limousine. Bob told his Liz Taylor stories but then he started talking about the basement of Studio 54 and I do not know what he was thinking of. Doria is going to interview Adam Luders from the New York City Ballet for us.

I wonder if they were having a fight and she went to jump out the window and he tried to stop her. He said he got the scratches on his face ""moving furniture."" Which he should not have said. I will be disappointed if he is guilty. I would think if he was that he would say so because there is something about him with integrity. So if he is guilty why is he trying to save himself? I would be disappointed in him. I would think he would just say so. And Lady Ann Lambton is in a movie about Sid Vicious and his girlfriend. she would gone to the audition disguised as a punk rocker and she got the job. Tina Chow called and said there was a dinner for Jean Michel Basquiat at 9:00 just really small. Jean Michel Basquiat had his mother and her friend there. I brought him a present one of my own hairpieces. He was shocked. One of my old ones. Framed. I put '""83"" on it but I do not know when it was from. it is one of my Paul Bochicchio wigs. It was a ""Paul Original."" You know I heard the kids at the office talking about my wigs and when I think how much work time they spend gossiping about me ... I mean like now Brigid has Sam to hate because I take him around with me but I mean he is just a babysitter for me. And Wilfredo's really the best babysitter. he is sweet but he is street-smart. And he takes numbers and follows up on business contacts. But he is so busy with his styling work at Interview and he still works Saturdays at Armani. Dropped Sam.

Dropped off Catherine Guinness (cab $4) and went home to change then picked her up and cabbed down to 18 West 38th Street ($3.60) to the opening of a new club that Helen Bransford had invited us to it is sort of trying to be a new Reno Sweeney's. Helen goes around with John Radziwill now. Fred thinks she is great and that we should be nice to her. Tim Hardin was singing there. Maxime de la Falaise was there with her new maybe-boyfriend Craig Braun. I worked with him on the Rolling Stones album cover. Barbara Allen was there and she is moving into Fred's house on 89th and Lexington for a while because she rented her apartment on East 63rd Street to Catherine and then Catherine let her stay there but she and Catherine living in the same apartment got to be too much. Went home and watched the news it is all the Gary Gilmore thing every night they have him on saying he wants to die he wants to die.
"Thursday, December 2, 1982",[John Travolta],0.019921150278293134,Cabbed to Xenon ($4) for Cornelia's birthday party. And I guess she was bored because she picked us out right away. Then photographers came over and said that Stallone was on the other side of the dance floor and that he would not be photographed with any girls so would I go over there and be photographed with him. So I did and Stallone was sweet he said he was starting to shoot a movie in February in New York starring John Travolta and that I really should stay in touch. He had about eight bodyguards with him at the bar. Then left. Got a fast cab ($5).

I walked around to the office for the office Christmas party. Then went home and got together. Went to Tom Armstrong's at 72nd and Park and Leo Castelli was there and Iris Love and Robert Rosenblum who said he did not understand why everybody gave my show at the Whitney a bad review. Bobo Le Gendre was there and I was mean to her because she is so phoney baloney. she is a friend of de Antonio's. she is a carpet heiress. They had shepherd's pie but I would eaten already. Then I took John to Richard Weisman's at you.N. Plaza. Ron Duguay was there and Rod Gilbert came without Judy and Fred was there and Whitney Tower and Averil who was going back to miniskirts wearing one of her mother's and she got a hole in it. Peter Beard was there and Cheryl Tiegs and I think Duguay finally got hot for Catherine after he was looking at her topless picture in the Exposures book. Vitas and the cute boy we photographed with him in Paris were there and John McEnroe. And just when the party was getting good John Reinhold dragged me into the closet and got so serious. He was just wacko saying I was his favorite friend and that when I do not call he goes crazy. I do not know what he meant he was just wacko. Catherine Oxenberg was there and lots of stewardess-looking girls and when girls get drunk they get obnoxious. I had a limo waiting so Catherine and I and a couple of the stewardesses got in it and we dropped Catherine and then me and I tipped the driver ($40) and he took everyone else home. And I missed Fred Mueller's party and Eleanor Ward's party and Keller Donovan's party and the Rolling Stone party.

She said Claudia was inside getting her dress for her wedding to Ron Perelman. When I met him originally I thought he was a bodyguard because he looks a little Mafia. But he owns Technicolor or something. So I was trying to get myself invited to the wedding. Gerry Grinberg from North American Watches came for lunch. He said that the economy is not good. I guess people are not buying watches. He said people were buying more expensive gifts but only for themselves. Bob Denison only sent me half of what he sent me the year before but then Park Avenue does have five times more trees planted on it than last year. Eizo my shiatsu massager wrote me a note thanking me for introducing him to Yoko Ono. She wants to see him every day but he can not do that and anyway your body needs a week to rest. he is doing little Sean tomorrow. And Eizo's wife's poetry teacher wrote me a Pop poem that I do not know what to do with. it is like ""I touch you and you touch me and we have feelings."" And you really learn all the gossip about everybody through this shiatsu network. Eizo told me that Yoko's boyfriend Sam has a soft body. And he said Yoko's been sick and has a bad back. And then went to 990 Fifth Avenue to the party Judy Peabody was giving for Peter Allen. I was talking to this art student and suddenly Peter came over and said to him ""I am leaving and you are coming with me!"" He thought I was stealing his boyfriend! Can you imagine? that is the first time that is ever happened to me. So I did not know what to do but then I guess Peter felt silly because later he was trying to entertain me. I left at 12:30 the party was just getting going."

But I did not call back because the messages were complicated-they were like ""Call me at this number after 5:30 or before 4:00 if it is not raining."" And then finally she called me at home-I wonder how she got the number-and that was strange. She sounded so tough. She said ""Now Andy when I invited you I invited you-I did not invite Bob Colacello."" She said she was upset because Bob ""writes things."" And now that I think about it Caroline made some comment like that at the party. And I mean there were lots of journalists there-Pete Hamill and Caroline's new boyfriend. I told her not to worry that Bob was not going to write anything. So something must have happened there that she does not want written about. She was thinking about it all day I guess. Catherine wanted to go to Cowboys (cab $2). it is so great going in there a black hole with all boy beauties and all available. And then every other person there is somebody. Charlie Cowles was there. Henry Post was there he is one of these kids that I like that everybody else says is terrible but there is something nice and intelligent about him. I asked him what he was doing there and he said he was doing research for a story."

Paige called and she would sent me a chocolate TV set she would had custom-made by one of the advertisers to celebrate our MSG-TV shows.

Maxime de la Falaise arrived late to pick up a Mao painting. Mike the super came in off the freight elevator with his wife and son but maybe the son is a stepson I am not sure. he is cute. John Powers came by and wanted me to sign two Flower posters that he had they were not authentic but I was going to just sign but Fred would not let me and so we gave John two authorized ones from the back. Ronnie and Gigi were there everyone was really diving into the caviar and champagne. Marc Balet the Interview art director and Fran Lebowitz were there. Andrea Portago had called that afternoon and said that if we could get her a ticket to the premiere of A Star Is Born she would get the limo so we did and she did. I could not figure out why she wanted to go so much until we got to the movie and she rushed up to Kris Kristofferson and said ""Oh darling it is so good to see you again."" Sue Mengers had tried to fill up the whole place. they would said it was going to be very hard to get in but then there were so many empty seats. Sue said everyone had to say they loved it or Barbra would be upset. I did not like it. The old Judy Garland one gave you goosebumps but this one was just a nothing rock and roll story. But Jed loved it. Then went over to the party at Tavern on the Green. Streisand was wearing a black tuxedo. Elsa Peretti was there and she was saying how wonderful it was to be with me and not be on anything that she did not take anything anymore. I admired a light bulb she had in her purse a tiny one that lit up when you put a penny next to it and she gave it to me and then Victor liked it so I gave it to him and then Elsa saw that and took it away from Victor and shook her finger at me and put it back in her purse. Andrea was just sitting there waiting for Kristofferson to notice her but he was busy."

Brigid began putting Christopher down and said that the only Christmas present that everybody at the office would really want is that Chris never come up there again. When I told him about it later he said that maybe he should pay Brigid the $20 he owes her. She did some work for him a few years ago on a project that then he did not get paid for so he felt that he did not have to pay her. And then of course he is cheap that is really why he did not pay her. And Robyn was so moody. Jay went home to Milwaukee and he is the only one who might have actually worked. And Peter Beard called and wanted us to okay a check from Cheryl Tiegs that he was trying to get cashed at Brownies because he wanted to go around the corner to Paragon and buy some sports equipment. So I guess he is being kept by Cheryl. she is really got the bucks she is got the Sears contract. And Lorna Luft came down because Liza's giving her her portrait for Christmas. And she had no makeup on and she looked beautiful. she is on the Cambridge diet and she really is pretty. Her portrait will be like Marilyn. If she just kept her regular brown haircolor and her regular looks she could be a big serious actress. But instead she tries to look the opposite of Liza to get an identity. Christmas is so confusing. Jon left for New Hampshire.

Guest's Christmas thing in Old Westbury but that would have meant an hour drive out there and an hour back. I did not want to do anything difficult because I was so afraid I was getting sick. I could feel it in my throat. Jon called from Massachusetts and wanted to know what shirt size I wore. I was the only one home so he had to ask me. He said he would call Halston's at 10:00. Got home and was too tired had some brandy and got drunk by the time I was supposed to go out. The dogs were with Jed away for the holidays. Walked over to Halston's. Victor had called and given me the list of people who were going to be there about twenty names and I would made up some packages to give them-snot rags with dollar signs. And a piece of sculpture. Liza was there though and Victor had not said she would be and I did not have anything for her so I said I would give her a Martha and she was thrilled she threw up her arms. Liza'd been to Harlem all day to visit the sick kids in the hospital. And that is the best thing to do. Jane Holzer and I said we would do it next year. Liza's here seeing her father he is dying of heart problems. Pat Cleveland was there just over hepatitis and she kissed everybody and my resistance is so low I think I will get it. Jane told me finally that she is madly in love with Ian Schrager and I said I did not want to hear it because I would only tell her negative things and then she would only report them to him who I do really like. I told her that she should just get his business sense from him and that is it. she would had gold dimes made up had them cast and she gave one to me. She had them made up for Ian because he always puts dimes in his mouth for phone calls. it is such a clever gift. At 3:00 Jane dropped me off and I took aspirin and packed and took a sleeping pill.

I was on my way to work but since there was no heat I decided I just could not. Picked up John Reinhold and we went to Sharon Hammond's for Christmas dinner (cab $5). But there was not anybody good there. Sharon took me in the other room and showed me a picture of her English lord pissing and his cock is like a horse's. She does not know if she should marry him but I told her she should with a cock like that. He did not give her the pillows she wanted for Christmas he just gave her a TV for the bathroom. And no jewelry. he would given her jewelry for her birthday and five minutes later she lost it in a cab so I guess he decided not to give her any more."

It was not as crowded as it was at Thanksgiving. Afterwards Stephen and I walked down the street and I had told John Reinhold we would come by and he could take us to tea and he did at the Carlyle and that was sort of I do not know young guys waiting for their grandmothers to die.

They fought because he was buying her presents and she did not have the money to buy him some and she got mad. she is like a bad forties movie. We got sent a copy of Steven Gaines's book The Club the ""novel"" about Studio 54.

Patti D'Arbanville and Don Johnson gave a big party and my dear Patti is now a lady. she is come a long way from the Max's Kansas City back room days when she was best friends with Geraldine Smith and Andrea Whips. She and Don Johnson gave the best party I have been to since we have been coming to Aspen. she is the cream of the crop. She still can not dress though. She never could. Even when we filmed her in Paris in our movie L'Amour-even in Paris she had no fashion. Jane Forth and Donna Jordan had all the style in that movie because the boys dressed them. At the party Patti was wearing eighteen-inch earrings and a white dress that did not show off the shape of her body. Don looks sort of old not the fresh young boy I remember meeting way back when he was in The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart. Before his comeback in Miami Vice and everything when he was not acting much he was hanging around with musicians and he remembered that time during the Jimmy Carter days when we were both in Nashville when that guy who supported Carter Phil Walden from Capricorn Records had the whole hotel down there booked for us. That time I was there with Catherine Guinness.

I found out about her being born in New York and about her having a grandfather who bought her fifty dolls and the mother would not give them to her. And they moved to Sacramento when Barbi was three. Met Zev Bufman again. Buzz Aldrin came from the moon. The astronaut. Took a lot of photographs of him. he is aged but he was cute and glad to meet us. We decided to start lying that night-Chris told people he had a twelve-month-old baby and that he was watching it while his wife was back in New York and they all believed him. And I told them I was a deep-sea fisherman and this lady invited me to Boca Raton. I have not been drinking at all."

They had lighted candles and Chastity was the flower girl she was kind of tall. And it was really beautiful it was snowing outside and everybody had candles and Susie was all in white and Sonny was crying. We were invited to Cathy Lee Crosby's party for Sonny. But we went off to one of the halls where Jimmy Buffett and his wife were hosting a New Year's Eve party. We found a corner where Lisa Taylor was and I made a faux pas and asked her about John McEnroe and she said she just broke up with him and she was drowning herself in drink. She was drinking tequila and Coke in a shot glass she said it goes right to your head and you get drunk really fast. And then I said hello to Jack Nicholson and Anjelica. And in yesterday's paper Margaret Trudeau talked about her affair with Jack and her new book is out where she talks about her cowboy Tom Sullivan and she does not even say that he died. Cathy Lee Crosby's party was starting at 11:30 but I did not want to be in anybody's house at the twelve of the clock thing so while we were walking we just decided to stay in the square we let all the other people go ahead and we just stood in the square because it was like a small version of Times Square. It was all the Aspen kids all drunk sort of drooling and falling and blowing horns and stuff like that in the middle of town and it was sort of cute it looked like La Boheme it looked more fake than the real thing."

He seems to think we know each other but I do not remember ever meeting him. But he came and he was just wonderful. He walked in like a butterball because of the big fat coat he was wearing but he is very normal nothing like his show-business personality which explains why he is so big because if he were really that kind of person he would be too crazy to make it. But gee he must have a lot of money-he has like eighteen houses. He said he taught Elvis how to dress. Badly. Glenn O'Brien was originally going to do him but then John Sex has been idolizing him for years and he came and then he just had such dumb questions like ""what is your favorite color?"" that I was going to then go back to having Glenn do it. But when John Sex and Liberace saw each other (laughs) they fell in love sparks flew. But Liberace's so normal you can see why he won all his court cases."

Jane looked great. Cab to the Corso on East 86th Street got there right at the right time. There were 100 policemen ($3). And a freelance photographer kid took my picture and said that the National Enquirer had called him about getting a picture of me for the cover. What can that be for? A palimony suit? Dying of cancer? It made me nervous trying to think. Missed a call from Jon in Las Vegas where Paramount was having their seventieth anniversary party.

Junk everywhere. A lot of toys. A lot of stuffed cows stuffed pigs. Pigs pigs pigs all over the place. And there was art. There were funny things hanging from the ceiling. There were water-dripping paintings. He buys a lot of art he said they sell more sausages that way because the people are very happy. Then he gave us a white smock and white hat. We went through and watched the ladies make the sausages. It was really fun. You could smell the sauerkraut cooking but they did not give us any hot dogs there. He had the whole portfolio of Picasso that I did the Picasso print of Paloma in. We looked at that then we had to look at more pigs and more salamis and more hams and more ham art. Then we took Polaroids for the portrait and had some tea. And his wife came by. They did not offer us lunch. Then all of a sudden he asked us if we would like to try one of his hot dogs. They cooked some up and we had two apiece. One white one and one black one. They were really good. We had them with mustard. He said he had to go have lunch back at the lunch room. We had to go off without lunch which we thought was really strange. We got in the car and drove to a restaurant in a place called Bottrop. As soon as we came in they told us it was this crazy day where all the women chase the men. They cut off your ties. But since we knew that was happening-we saw these drunken ladies running around-we took our ties off and hid them in our pockets. But then they got my shirt tail and they cut it off and it was my good shirt and I was so mad. These women were really bullies. We got back in the car and drove back to Hans's gallery.

I guess he felt he had to after making me meet the Polish Warhol. Dr. Warchol. The dancing it is a funny new kind of dancing falling and tripping and it looks like disco dancing. It looks like if you had a creative person on the disco floor that they would do this (intermission drinks $10). Jack Kroll was there. Henry Post told me that John Fairchild Jr. snuck him into Studio 54 the other night-Henry's been barred for what he wrote in his article about the club and when Ian Schrager saw him he asked him to ""leave in a gentlemanly fashion."" He said he started to argue that it was a public place but then he got scared. I really do not know why Pat Cleveland and Sterling St. Jacques never did any other of their dancing up into an act. Although Ronnie tells me that Pat's going to be performing down at the Mudd Club. that is the latest club for young kids it is down around White Street.

Bianca left because she was staying out in Malibu and Mick was coming in and then leaving town the next day so she wanted to get home early to see him."
"Thursday, February 17, 1983","[Jill Fuller, Lady Sharon]",0.12884615384615383,"It was a beautiful spring day almost. I had a lunch date with Lady Sharon and Jill Fuller at ""21"" it was Jill's birthday and I brought her a Dollar Sign. I was surprised to look at her hand and not see a wedding ring and she said that it was over already-he was just some kid she would met in a discotheque. He called her an old bag or something and she threw him out. I told them the real story of Bob's quitting after I would not give him the Hammer & Sickle painting. And when I later got back to the office and told Fred that I would made a mistake and told it he got mad and he said that now it will be in the papers. Which I guess is true. And Jill and Sharon said that people were going to drop Bob. And actually Jill and Sharon are the kind of people who would drop Bob. And Sharon said ""Bob's a friend of mine but he is moody and it is hard to take."" But you know it is true all those people are really going to drop Bob if he does not have a column someplace. They just want to be in a column-that is what they have him over for! Oh and that Iranian lady you know Bob's friend Mercedes Kellogg Sharon was telling me what a fat thing Mercedes was and that Sharon helped her and got her to lose forty pounds and now she is dyed her hair blonde and is a big hostess and she does not even call Sharon."
"Thursday, February 19, 1981","[Chris Makos, Christopher Gibbs, Doria Reagan, Faye Dunaway, Joan Crawford, Jon Gould, Mary Tyler Moore]",0.16624999999999998,I wanted to go pass out Interviews but it was too late. I had to meet Christopher Gibbs from England at the office (cab $5.50). Doria Reagan was there typing away. And they really do not have one Secret Service guy with her and she could be with baby. I mean do not they care about the possible grandson? And Brigid and I are finally going to see Mary Tyler Moore on Monday. she is trying to change her image so she is a problem-she did not want to wear rich Halstons for the photos and she did not want to come to lunch with the rich Basses and she did not want to go to rich Quo Vadis for dinner-she wants us to meet her at John's Pizza Parlor on Bleecker Street. And did I remember to say that Faye Dunaway called the other day? she is doing Mommie Dearest playing Joan Crawford and she wanted to know if I had bought Joan Crawford's heart pin at that auction and could she borrow it. But I had not. Faye just picks up the phone herself and calls so she is fun so maybe I will call her up sometime. I will get her number from Ara. She might be good to do a story on. I just saw Hurry Sundown on TV and she was so beautiful. I invited Jon Gould to see 42nd Street because he is looking for ideas for Paramount and I want to suggest Popism to him as a movie so I brought a copy. would not it be great if he got Paramount to buy it? And then I could work on it with him he knows so much-all these facts and figures and surveys-he would really be a good person to get to know. Cabbed to Wintergarden ($4). From the first row you can not see the feet tapping (laughs) you can only see the knees. Then after the show we walked to the Russian Tea Room to meet Chris Makos who'd been to see Sphinx and loved it.

La actress famosa di Chelsea Girls?"" And Brigid was mortified that now she was a receptionist so she told him that she would just appeared in Bad too. He was so excited telling the people with him how famous she was and acting like he would just met Greta Garbo and (laughs) poor Brigid had to keep answering phones. Ran into Robert Mapplethorpe near the office. He told me he has a show opening in San Francisco and he is going there for a month for a ""sex vacation"" because ""San Francisco is the best place for sex in America."" Went home to change and then went to pick up Barbara Allen to go to a party at Diane Von Furstenberg's (cab $2.60). I was not invited-Barbara invited me as her date. Her ex Philip Niarchos was going to be there with Manuela. We got to 1060 Fifth Avenue about 9:00 and it was a super party. Diane has a big apartment huge with fabric on the walls. She has a bathroom as big as a living room. Barry Diller lives there now too when he is in town. She had wood painted white and then painted wood-grained like Art Nouveau. I made a faux pas. I walked into the room where everyone was eating and Carl Bernstein was talking to Helen Gurley Brown and he looked up and said to me ""Do you think Bob Colacello is attractive?"" and I did not know what was going on and I guess I put my foot in it I said ""Well he is not my type"" and she got up and walked away. And then he told me that she would mistaken him for Bob Colacello and when he got insulted she was telling him how attractive Bob Colacello was and I blew it. Barbara is really unhappy-Bianca's got herself a movie career and Manuela has Philip. She had a good long talk at Diane's with Philip. And Manuela is not good-looking at all. Barbara said the same thing that Bianca did that Mick Flick was after her."
"Thursday, February 20, 1986",[Ron Reagan],0.1375,There was a lunch at the office for three of Paige's advertisers and also for Billy Boy to give him a Barbie portrait. Bettina was with him. Rupert came up with some work before he was going off to Patrick's funeral. Anthony d'Offay was there from London to check on the Self-Portraits. Ended up the day watching the Letterman show with Ron Reagan Jr. on and he is really changed. I was surprised he was so forward. And Letterman was just so thrilled to have him on. And the daughter's got a People cover for her trashy book so the whole family is out there hustling.
"Thursday, February 21, 1980","[Carly Simon, Richard Weisman, Tony Bill]",-0.000876322751322739,"Did I ever say that a couple of weeks ago Bianca asked us about the night she gave Bob a ride home from Halston's after he threw up in the sink? Bob was sort of shocked that she would bring it up. This is the night we saw the chauffeur getting out of the back part of the limo. Bob said he told her ""Well Bianca you just took me home. Everyone called me up the next morning and said how it was nice of you to stay with me for an hour and a half. I said you had not been with me. They told me they found you and the chauffeur in the back seat together."" She said that she just passed out after she dropped Bob off because Mick had given her three vodkas in a row at the Erteguns' house and that she got so excited at seeing him there that the vodkas just made her black out. She said that the chauffeur was in the back with her really just trying to wake her up. And Bianca told me she was never jealous of Jerry that she knows Mick is with Jerry because he is into a real sex trip right now. And I said ""Well Jerry told us that she gives Mick a blow job before she let us him out of the house"" and Bianca said ""Why did not you put that in her interview?"" I said ""Because you were mad enough at us for putting her in Interview in the first place let alone if we had her talking about sex with Mick."" Bianca said she would not care she said the only girlfriend of Mick's she ever got jealous of was Carly Simon because Carly Simon is intelligent and has the look Mick likes-she looks like Mick and Bianca. Richard Weisman asked me if I wanted to meet Stallone and have lunch with him on Friday on the set of his movie. He said Stallone may want his portrait done. Some Japanese journalist came by. he would gone with us in Japan from Tokyo to Kyoto copying me by taping the trip but nothing was said (laughs). The Japanese Warhol. So he was in town and I thought I would give him some material to write about since his last time with us was not much so I took him with me and we went to Madison Square Garden to the antique show (cab $3). And in the cab I said ""where is your tape recorder?"" and he pulled it out of his bag-it was the only thing in the bag this tape recorder running-but it turned out that it was running slow and the batteries were no good and he was just crushed he could not believe it and he said ""Oh Jesus Christ oh Jesus oh Christ oh Jesus oh God oh Christ"" and I said ""Well there is your interview."" But it was sad he felt so bad and I said ""Oh you can remember."" Anyway we got to Madison Square Garden and it was really great I could not believe all the junk (tickets were 2 x $4 = $8). Ran into Tony Bill."
"Thursday, February 23, 1978","[Andrea Marcovicci, Margaret Trudeau, Tom Sullivan]",-0.0609375,"Went to Regine's. Andrea Marcovicci was there. And Tom Sullivan. Someone was saying that Andrea Marcovicci looked like Margaret Trudeau and I was saying oh yeah and then I turned around and there was Margaret Trudeau I did not know she was there and Tom said ""I thought you knew."" And Tom was sad because he could not be with Margaret she was staying in the background so she would not be photographed with him because she is still married. But then this photographer guy who was there with a foreign accent said to Tom that he saw him fucking Margaret in the balcony at Studio 54 the other night and the reason he saw them was that he was up there fucking a girl himself. And finally Margaret came and she talked to me so she could be near Tom and the photographers took pictures. And Catherine was unhappy because Tom was in love with Margaret."
"Thursday, February 23, 1984","[Bob Colacello, Goldie Hawn, Jane Fonda, Jean Michel Basquiat]",0.040624999999999994,I was picked up by Benjamin and we went out with Interviews but I really do not like passing out this Jane Fonda issue because I just do not like the cover it does not look like her and there is no black in it. The one that is coming next with Goldie Hawn looks good though. Oh and I ran into Bob Colacello. And he asked me for an Interview. I asked if his building had gone co-op and he said no that it went condo. Well Jean Michel Basquiat is coming back from Hawaii on the first and going to Sweden on the second. Just for a few days. Our old friend from Stockholm Stellan says he has Swedish girls lined up waiting for him over there.
"Thursday, February 27, 1986","[Arnold Schwarzenegger, Maria Shriver]",-0.07800925925925926,Oh and that lady Halston was supposed to bring down for a portrait cancelled but I mean anybody who keeps telling you she is got a check for $999 million in her pocketbook is either having a nervous breakdown or she is on coke. And Arnold Schwarzenegger never called back. He was going to have Maria Shriver's portrait done for a wedding present and then her mother and cousins too.
"Thursday, February 28, 1980","[Barbara Rose, George Gershwin, Harry Bailey, Jerry Leiber]",-0.12479978354978356,"Picked up Catherine cabbed to Harry Bailey's on East 72nd Street ($2). It used to be George Gershwin's apartment. Barbara Rose was there with her husband the ""Hound Dog"" guy Jerry Leiber and she is so horrible. she is the worst person she comes over and says things like ""Oh I love your new writing style that you did not write."" I mean what makes people do things like that? They must be sick. She was just the worst-dressed woman there she looked so awful. I should have said to her ""I love your clothes."" I have got to start thinking faster. I do not know why Harry would want to have dinner with Barbara Rose unless he thought she knew what art he should be buying."
"Thursday, February 3, 1977","[Jamie Wyeth, Jean Smith]",-0.08417876683501684,-New York-Denver At the airport in the morning I ran into Jean Smith who was on the same flight. She was with her son who was sort of big and heavy. She asked about Jamie Wyeth. In Denver there was a blonde girl driving a Rolls Royce she had on a chauffeur's cap and gave a tour of the city. Dropped us at the Brown Palace Hotel an old hotel with a new annex but I decided to stay in the old part. The lobby looked better than the room service very fast lots of extras like showercaps a new TV and soap. Room had a basket of fruit. I called my nephew Father Paul and said I would meet him the next day at my opening. Picked up at 6:30 for the preview for the patrons. Fred got really drunk. He got mad at some tough ninety-year-old lady and told her that he was only there for the money honey and I tried to shut him up but he just hated the whole thing so much and he decided that next time I did personal appearances he would stipulate that they had to buy something. All the women too ugly for portraits.
"Thursday, February 3, 1983","[Grace Jones, Keith Haring, Rene Ricard]",0.04621212121212121,"Went to Antonio's show at Parsons with Jon (cab $4). It was really crowded and I got mobbed for autographs and I was signing away and Grace Jones was refusing to sign autographs telling the girls and boys to get lost but then when she saw me signing so much I think she got embarrassed so she came over and explained that her public liked it better when she treated them that way. I could not believe her. Then to the Keith Haring opening (cab $4). It was on the Lower East Side at the Fun Gallery it is called. So we walked into the place and there is Rene Ricard and he is screaming ""Oh my God! From the sixties to the eighties and I am still seeing you everywhere!"" And I said how could he have said all those awful things about me in the Edie book and he said that I should have seen it before they cut it. And Keith's show looked good it was his pictures hanging on a background of his pictures. Like my Whitney retrospective show was-all hung on top of my Cow wallpaper. We left there and Chris and Peter wanted to go to the Coach House naturally because it was the most expensive place."
"Thursday, February 4, 1982","[Frank Sinatra, Nikki Haskell, Pia Zadora]",0.24545454545454545,"The Du Pont twins sent me an invitation to the opening of a new restaurant called Jeanie's in the old Tudor Hotel and it was a Nikki Haskell event (cab $4). Cornelia Guest came but I guess she is been reading her newspaper clippings so she only stayed a minute. The food was good and I ordered a lot. And the steak arrived and Chris had his wrapped up and ready to take home for breakfast before it was even served practically and they wanted to know what was wrong. And there was a party for Pia Zadora that Frank Sinatra was even coming in for at Hisae that we could have gone to but Bob would not put her on the cover and she would have been just great to have on the cover I just love her. it is like if Andrea ""Whips"" Feldman had been not crazy and had a better nose. Pia's like all those tiny girls we knew who always grabbed the spotlight."
"Thursday, February 5, 1987","[Bette Midler, Elsie Woodward, Joan Rivers, John Reinhold, Nick Dunne]",0.018471420554753894,Went to E.A.T. and our favorite girl gave us extra food (tip $15). I ate it all which was a mistake (phone $.50 newspaper $1 cab $5). And then at the office Sam had potato chips with vinegar and salt and I ate so many of those because they were so unusual. Vincent was doing the TV show and there were no celebrity hostesses available so we used a cute girl model. But when I did my scenes with her I sat in a funny position and I got a pain and it did not go away. Paige was home sick so I had a free night no advertising dinners and Sam and I decided to go to a movie and then John Reinhold wanted to join us so we could talk about the jewelry business at dinner first. So went to Nippon (cab $6). And we did that stuff and then we decided to see the Bette Midler Outrageous Fortune movie since it was the big money-maker of the week but as we were leaving the restaurant I felt a sharp pain and I could not go on. I got scared and said I could not go and they dropped me off. I was trying to think positively and mind-over-matter and when I got to my front door it was like a miracle it suddenly went away. It was completely gone. And then I wished I would hung on for a few minutes because then I would not have had to tell anybody something was wrong. But I went inside and locked the dogs out of the room because they were bothering me and they got mad they did not understand I was mentally unstable. And I fell asleep and woke up when Joan Rivers was on and she was doing something odd on her show solving a mystery of somebody being killed like a game. So now I am throwing out all the junk food. I guess it was a gallbladder attack. And then I remembered that when I got the first one was when Fred took me to the Waldorf to meet the old Mrs. Woodward who was about ninety then-it was '73 or '74 I think-and he had to take me to the hospital and then this week is when that novel Nick Dunne wrote The Two Mrs. Grenvilles is on TV which was really the Elsie Woodward story so I felt like there was a connection.
"Thursday, February 8, 1979",[Neil Sedaka],-0.043181818181818196,Worked at the studio then had to leave early. Dropped Bob (cab $4). Went to Neil Sedaka's place 510 Park Avenue for cocktails before the Police Athletic League dinner. I met Leba a few weeks ago and she said they wanted a portrait. The Sedakas are subletting this place until their apartment is finished. All the talk was about how hard it was getting into a building because they are Jewish and entertainers and an older couple was there who got them in. A lot of the people were in black tie. I looked the worst in my old jeans and a sweater but Neil was casual in a sweater California-style although he is from Brooklyn. He seems like a fairy but he is not. I do not know how his portrait will come out though because he is chubby. The decorator who is doing their apartment was there with his boyfriend and we had cocktails it was fun.
"Thursday, February 9, 1978",[Suzie Frankfurt],-0.16064814814814815,Bob called in the morning and said that Suzie Frankfurt was becoming a Roman Catholic and that she was getting baptized this morning and that we should go up to the church (cab to 83rd and Park $3). It only took a minute Suzie got baptized and her hair got wet and we went back to her house for coffee. Cabbed down to Union Square ($3). Anselmino was calling from Italy all day screaming hysterically about forgeries of my paintings that he was being offered. And my nephew was there all day writing letters and making phone calls. I worked until about 7:00.
"Thursday, January 1, 1987",[],-0.5,The weather was raining and awful. Stayed in and had a rest day.
"Thursday, January 10, 1985","[Alba Clemente, Bryan Ferry, Jean Michel Basquiat, Julian Schnabel, Maria Callas, Thomas Ammann]",0.10310972039232909,Fred said that Si Newhouse passed on buying my painting. I guess I was hot before Christmas and now I am not. This was for another painting not the Natalie that he already got. And Fred told me that he would called down to Leo's and asked the kids who work there why Leo had said such bad things about me in that USA Today article on me on Monday and they said they would find out. And they told Fred that Rauschenberg left Leo to go to Blum-Helman. is not that something? Well it is that Leo's getting senile. I know that is why he said those things he is getting senile. Benjamin dropped me at Jean Michel Basquiat's and he has like twenty people working for him getting big canvases ready. it is really neat and clean there now and it looks great. And he has a $5000 TV set that is really big. Then we cabbed to Julian Schnabel's on Park Avenue South and 20th. Bryan Ferry was there. Julian has all his own art in the place and he tells you about each one he stands there and reads into his own work. I mean he literally stands there and (laughs) tells you what his paintings mean. And this was the first time in a long time I wished I was tape recording. Schnabel also makes his own furniture. He made his own bed. Cast iron gunmetal really heavy. If you ever fell on it you would kill yourself. His little girl was there and she was pulling her nightgown up and showing her pussy. (laughs) It was weird. And all his paintings are just everywhere all the plate canvases-he used to be a short-order cook. And he has the best furniture from the fifties. Schnabel has so much energy and balls he really does. We drank red wine. it is the newest thing to drink red wine all through the meal you do not have to have white wine with fish and things anymore. it is such a camp when they do the tasting and the lip-smacking. So then we went over to Clemente's. The table there was one that Schnabel had made and actually it was great. The legs were all from different things and the top is hand-colored plaster. And all through dinner they played Maria Callas records! It was incredible. there is this new collection of forty records of everything she ever did and it comes in two cases and they sell them at newsstands in Italy. And it was just like the sixties. I could almost see Ondine whisking around in the shadows. And you could hear all the booing and the clapping on the record. The food was good and it smelled so terrific. Alba Clemente did it. She could be the best movie star her voice is so low and so loud and so sexy and interesting and she is pretty. And the talk was all about art. Julian was putting down de Kooning and I said oh no that he was wrong that de Kooning was a great painter and then finally Clemente said yes that he really was. Thomas Ammann called and said that it was really cold in Switzerland. Bruno wants me to go there for Jean Michel Basquiat's opening. Someone was saying that when all these dealers heard there was a really talented black artist who would probably die off soon from drugs that they hurried to buy his things and now I guess they are frustrated because he is staying alive. I think Jean Michel Basquiat will be the most famous black artist after this New York Times thing comes out.
"Thursday, January 11, 1979","[Barry Landau, Phyllis Diller]",0.05720000000000003,"Fred was back from his trip very very happy because he lost twenty pounds he is back to 120 and sporting a mustache and he looks great very young. He brought me back an emerald it is the smallest one I have ever seen-blink and you miss it. it is a tenth of a carat and comes with a certificate and the certificate is really cute. Went to dinner at La Grenouille with Phyllis Diller and Barry Landau (cab $4). A lot of people were asking Phyllis for her autograph and not me and afterwards she (laughs) said to me ""Oh I am sorry dear I felt so bad for you."""
"Thursday, January 12, 1978","[Barbara Allen, Bette Midler, Burt Reynolds, Cab Calloway, Chessy Rayner, Jim Bailey, Lee Radziwill, Lucie Arnaz, Mica Ertegun, Peter Beard, Peter Tufo, Richard Turley, Ron Galella]",0.05256732238349886,"Interviewed Lucie Arnaz at Quo Vadis and it was nothing really startling. she is so tall she eats everything she is a little fat and she was wearing jeans so she looked fatter but she has a beautiful face. We brought up Jim Bailey the female impersonator and Burt Reynolds. She dated both of them. She said Burt was sweet and devoted. These girls are brought up strict they think you should not put out. Went uptown ($6) to pick Catherine up at 7:50 and walked over to the Copa for the Bette Midler opening that Mica Ertegun sent tickets for. Ron Galella was there and he had his own camera crew-a TV thing was being done on him. It was the same Mafia-type people at the Copa like when we had our party there last year. Richard Turley was standing in the doorway and he asked if he could try to slip in with me and I did not know what to say I said he could do whatever he wanted to but that it was Mafia and that he would never make it and he did not. Chessy Rayner was there and Peter Tufo and Lee Radziwill were there together but she was at a different table from him and I will get to that in a second. I could not see anything just the top two inches of Bette's head when she finally came out. And Catherine was sitting so that she faced Peter Tufo and pretty soon I felt his leg rubbing against mine and I guess he thought it was Catherine. They were really flirting hot and heavy and he said to her ""Why do not you get up on the table and boogie?"" and I was surprised because he is usually so sour. He was yelling things like (laughs) ""Colored sounds!"" at the black girls singing. I kept hitting Catherine to turn around and look at the show but she was telling about going to Plato's Retreat the night before. She said she did not know if she would been penetrated or not while she was there and hearing this got Peter Tufo hotter and she spilled a drink on his pants but that just made him hotter too and he slipped her a note that I found out later said just ""When?"" and all I could think was that it was a repeat of our friend Barbara Allen taking Peter Beard away from Lee and now here our friend Catherine was stealing Peter Tufo. I just wanted to run out it is a firetrap there I hate to be in places like that. And then everybody left Catherine went back inside to get the ""When?"" note and we got separated and she went over to Quo Vadis in the Erteguns' limo and I walked over and when I was walking in Lee and Peter Tufo were fighting but Lee stopped fighting to wish me Happy New Year with a kiss. We were at Ahmet's table. Dinner was a little pigeon. Lee left first and I thought Peter Tufo would stay for Catherine but he left with Lee so Catherine was safe. And Ahmet was loading up with cognac and being funny. And afterwards we were all invited up to the Cotton Club which they were reopening with Cab Calloway in Harlem and Catherine and Mica and Ahmet wanted to go but I do not think anybody else really did. I walked Catherine home and it was early. Also today got back my photographs of Edwige cutting her wrists at Victor's party the other night and Victor said that her scars would be punk jewelry. And Bob met today with the Rums of Puerto Rico guy from Kenyon & Eckhardt and the guy who is from something like the Puerto Rican Chamber of Commerce and they want to have a party at the office to unveil the Liza portrait I am doing because Liza's endorsing Rums of Puerto Rico and so they are giving Interview three months of rum ads. they are trying to get Burt Reynolds for this campaign and I would be doing his portrait too but the two people he wants to be in the ad with him the agency did not think they were ""cosmetically right."" So Bob called Burt's manager in L.A. and had to ask if they could submit some other possibilities and the manager said ""Listen Burt's endorsement is worth a million dollars and he is only even considering it because he wants a Warhol portrait and if Burt sent a midget and a dwarf over to be in the ad with him Rums of Puerto Rico and their ad agency should be thrilled."" And Bob said the people Burt wants are not even bad-looking anyway."
"Thursday, January 14, 1986","[Charles Rydell, Doc Cox, Michael Douglas]",-0.0367965367965368,Chris told me that what Edmund was actually sick with was TB but that he is getting over it now. My mother had it after she came to New York and you just have to take a lot of antibiotics. She never coughed or anything and I do not know how she got it in New York I guess it is just a virus. Doc Cox found out she had it and she got over it in a month. And the Department of Health people kept coming around for years. Brigid said she is going to Paris for two weeks with Charles Rydell. She said her mother's bought the coffin for her father. They expect him to go any day now. they have got a turkey baster stuck in his throat to feed him. Saw Jewel of the Nile which was a bore (tickets $18 popcorn $7). Michael Douglas's nose is getting hooked. I wonder if his father had a nose job.
"Thursday, January 17, 1980","[Lauren Hutton, Richard Gere, Steve Rubell]",0.125,Interview gave a screening of American Gigolo at the Gulf + Western building (cab $4.50). Richard Gere was really good and Lauren Hutton was great. she is a senator's wife who gives the hustler his murder alibi. Richard Gere has a sex scene where you see him completely nude. Nando did the art direction and at the end of the movie there is a scene where a pimp is being thrown off a balcony by Richard Gere and you see my three posters in the background the Torsos. The scene is played against them. After the movie I dropped Catherine but right when I did Halston's limo pulled up and he and Bianca said they were going to Studio 54 for Steve Rubell's farewell party before his sentencing so my cab followed their limo ($3.50). When we got there we stood around and they were taking pictures. Halston was smart he disappeared but I did not realize what was going on. It was really crowded and it was early. I dropped Catherine off at 2:00. Somebody said that they would put locks on Steve's safety-deposit boxes.
"Thursday, January 17, 1985",[],0.2393650793650793,"I heard snow shovels hitting the pavement at 6 A.M. And there is a big bus of students coming up from Carnegie-Mellon for a tour of the office. They probably got up at 6:30 and they are zipping along on the highway right now. Oh God oh God ... I talked to Gael for about an hour and she said ""Tell me how wonderful I am"" and so I said ""How wonderful you are."" And she said she turned down a big job with cable TV and if it was big she should have taken it but if I would said that to her she would have gone home crying."
"Thursday, January 18, 1979",[Stephen Mueller],0.17500000000000002,It was the first time I ever saw people actually flying around the streets it was so windy. Cabbed to Union Square ($3) and that is where I really saw people in the air. If you were on the sunny side of the street it was nice beautiful but then when you would hit a corner you would get blown away. People were holding on to things. Went to the office. Stephen Mueller and Ronnie were finishing stretching Shadow paintings for my show next week.
"Thursday, January 19, 1978","[Joan Crawford, Lady Weidenfeld, Margot Fonteyn, Sandra Payson]",0.03937499999999999,Went to the auction of Joan Crawford's costume jewelry. Saw PH there bidding on a huge pink necklace and when it went over her limit she dropped out but then I bid some more and got it and gave it to her. She was so grateful she took me down to the Village to Sixth Avenue near Waverly and showed me a secret store she would discovered on the second floor where a man sells all the Diors and Balenciagas that belonged to his sister who is now dead. It was the greatest place and I bought about five dresses. Everything there is size 14 though because the sister was fat. The store is called Fabulous Fashions and it has hats and handbags and umbrellas too and it is all cheap. I went home to change for dinner but I forgot that Sandra Payson-you know Lady Weidenfeld-had told me it was black tie. So I glued myself and went over there. Cabbed to Sutton Place ($2.25). It was a small dinner party and when I saw I was the only one not in black tie that is when I remembered that she had mentioned it. When they saw how bad I looked everybody ran away from me and they did not come back until they were drunk. I was trying to make it better with conversation so I just started telling them about how I was buying lots of dresses now and they just backed away. And Mrs. Payson invited me I think because she wanted a painting but she never mentioned a thing about it so I guess she was so shocked by my clothes that she decided against it. The party was for a ballerina whose name I forget but who was the big ballerina at the same time Margot Fonteyn was-not a Russian though. She told me about every cat she would ever had and how each one died. She had a Siamese who jumped onto a ledge and then fell five stories and she said she could still see the claw marks that it left on the ledge and that was sad-it tried to turn around and it slipped.

And then we were passing the park and the pigeons were just going crazy they were so starving so we threw them the box of it. Usually they will not eat candy but they were so starving they did. Barbara Allen called from Barbados because she would just been interviewed about the expose that Women's Wear Daily is doing on me. She said she said ""all the right things"" so I can just imagine. Maybe they will not run it. she is still with the same guy the Polish guy."

Carter inaugurated. Disgusting drunks on the plane. Airport empty disorganized. While standing there ran into Marina Cicogna and Florinda Bolkan coming from St. Moritz (cab to the Grand Hotel $20). Hotel suite was not ready so we had to have lunch in the dining room. While we were there we ran into Helmut Newton and Patrick the makeup artist. And Suni Agnelli came in. Had the suite Man Ray stayed in he just died-he would had a big opening in Rome right before. Fred said to forget what he would said about me being a fading star in Germany he sobered up said that I did not have to go.

Scary and stupid. Got that all over with. Signed a lot of posters. Then we had free time. Lunch with Gianni Versace went to his castle. Rizzoli's old castle. Big Roman and Greek statues that Suzie Frankfurt got Versace to buy. It was grand huge so glamorous. We had a good time. Then had to go back to the gallery to do another press conference at 4:30. Stayed till 8:30 with Daniela coughing in my face and me signing autographs. Gianni did the costumes for Bob Wilson's Salome at La Scala. He got us tickets so I could slip away from my opening when I got tired. Finally Fred grabbed my pen and whisked me away. Sat in a box seat watching the opera then had to go to this dinner for me. Saw Gerard Malanga's first girlfriend there who he wrote all the poems about Benedetta Barzini. She was with her husband and being so grand. I ate a lot and Daniela was coughing into my food. I would been resisting her flu for two days straight while she talked into my face but finally I gave in and got it. Went home just exhausted.

She was getting ready for the Shadows opening all day she went home and put on all her jewelry. People kept wandering in and out all day. They were sending a limo for me and it came at 5:00. I glued and took some of the kids down there with me. It was snowing a little. It was not too many people at first. Actually it was a big business gathering. Barbara Colacello had gotten free champagne and Seagram's and Evian and some other free liquor and drinks telling them that the society people would be coming down. But it turned out that out of the 400 people Bob invited only 6 came. Six out of 400: Truman Capote the Eberstadts Fereydoun Hoveyda who just resigned as ambassador and the Gilmans. So 394 of our best friends were no-shows. No Halston-he was in Mustique. No Steve-he was too. No Catherine. It turned out to be more of a punk opening all the wonderful usual fantasy kids that go to openings like that. And Rene Ricard was there. Mrs. de Menil came and she was sweet and Francois he was sweet. But Addie and Christophe de Menil did not come. David Bourdon and Gregory Battcock it was fun to see them but we did not get a chance to talk. A lot of kids had their own cameras they were looking in vain for celebrities to take pictures of. Victor was the only well-dressed person-an umbrella and black pearls. The bathroom was crowded I guess people were coking up. We got a group together to go to dinner-Jed John Reinhold John Fairchild Jr. and his girlfriend Belle McIntyre William Pitt and Henry Post. Bob was mad at me for inviting Henry Post he says he does those expose-type articles and maybe he is right maybe I will get myself into trouble. We were limoing to 65 Irving Place to ""65 Irving."" And on the way near Washington Square we saw a dog get hit by a cab and a woman was screaming and we offered her the limo to take the dog to the hospital but she said her husband was getting the car and it ruined the whole night. It made me feel funny. Philippa invited Rene Ricard-her Dia Foundation just signed him up for benefits as the first poet-so he arrived at 65 Irving and was saying that my work was just ""decorative."" That got me really mad and I am so embarrassed everybody saw the real me. I got so red and was telling him off and then he was screaming things like that John Fairchild Jr. was my boyfriend-you know how horrible Rene is-and it was like one of those old Ondine fights and everybody was stunned to see me so angry and out of control and screaming back at him. And do you know that Rene has an agent now? And do you know who that agent is? Gerard Malanga. And I mean Rene acts as if he is such a wonderful writer but he just has one idea and he keeps repeating it over and over-about how he is wined and dined by the rich and how you should get things for free that same old stuff. Luckily Henry Post missed this fight he was at another table. I have another opening on Saturday this one was just a preview. The show only looks good because it is so big."

He said he was just there dropping something off. He should not have answered the phone. When I told Catherine later that he had she said ""Well you got me"" and she was slightly embarrassed. The boots arrived at the airport and Peter Beard brought them down. Mine fit perfectly I would told Tom to get me 8-D-the only thing wrong was that I had said round toe and they came with the pointy toe. And they would all come in a big box and Peter had taken the shoes out of the box because it was so big and thrown the box away and then we found out that one of Catherine's pair was still in the box and so Tom's driver went back uptown looking for where they would thrown out the box and he did come back with it so Catherine was thrilled. they are cowboy boots made out of elephant ears. Lunch for Isabella Rossellini (supplies $7.13 $16.41). John Richardson was there and gave me a present of a picture of his cock. Bianca was wearing white with a purple Halston stole and she and Tom Sullivan Brigid said ""were practically fucking against the wall it was really disgusting""-and Isabella Rossellini Robin West and Claus von Bulow were there. Dinner was at Bianca-at-Halston's it was veal blanquettes. Diana Vreeland was there with Fred and Stevie is so funny he said to me she was ""fascinating"" and then later in the evening he said she was so boring he did not know how to get rid of her. And you know I have come to realize lately that Diana Vreeland is just a person. I realized it a few months ago when I was thinking again about the thing in the sixties with Viva at Vogue when Diana killed the pages on Viva that would have made Viva's career. Diana does do things for her ""career""-she listens to people who tell her if something's a bad thing to do if she would suffer professionally and then she does what they tell her. Somebody must have told her that if she ran the Viva photos it would be a bad thing for her. You think that she does not think that way because she is Diana Vreeland but then you suddenly realize that she does."
"Thursday, January 27, 1983","[Barbara Allen, Barbara Sinatra, Barry Diller, David Geffen, Diana Ross, Diane Von Furstenberg, Edmund Gaultney, Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Robert Risko, Steve Wynn]",0.1525786041215729,"- New York-Atlantic City New Jersey-New York I was going down later to Atlantic City my first time with Diana Ross to see the Frank Sinatra show and bring a print of the portrait I did of her down to the guy who owns the Golden Nugget. Diana had just signed a contract with the Golden Nugget to play in this room they are paying her a lot and she is never played a small room before so she wanted to see it. And I had a fight with the assistant art director girl at Interview I called her dumb but then I cooled down. It was like Mr. Brodovich the famous art director at Bazaar when he used to scream at me. You know it was just people doing what they want to do after you tell them what to do. But Fred told me that you can get more out of people if you tell them they are dumb in a nice way so the situation cooled down. And the Twiggy cover came out so bad-it was so ugly Twiggy in a snood-that we are going to use a Robert Risko caricature for the cover. Because Vanity Fair is coming out and they are stealing all our artists so we wanted to get this look out first since it is going to be their look. Then suddenly it was 5:00 and I had to be home by 5:15 when Diana Ross was picking me up to go to the helicopter (cab $5.50). Just had time to put my contacts in. The doorbell rang and it was just Diana alone so I was nervous. Then we went to the 60th Street place and got a Pan Am helicopter that the Golden Nugget was paying for. We had to wait a few minutes for her lawyer and also going down with us was Frank Sinatra's tailor who had an Italian name but looked Jewish. And I liked the lawyer there was something adorable about him. I have noticed that all these people on top have a twinkle in their eye their eyes twinkle. And he kept calling Los Angeles all night because of the big floods there to find out if his house had gone down the drain with his wife and kids. As a matter of fact everybody from California was calling to find out if their houses were still there. Diana called too. And you would hear things from the phone like ""Oh no! The neighbor's house just went!"" I told Diana she should really marry Barry Diller and she said how could she take a girlfriend's man-meaning Diane Von Furstenberg. I told her she really had to do more movies. And we talked about David Geffen. I told her she should really be friends with him again because he was in with that crowd and she said that they had been really good friends that he was so great to her when her mother had cancer he took her to Sloan-Kettering when she had no idea at all what to do and I asked her when this was and she said ""Last year."" So I said ""Well what happened?"" And she sort of said Dreamgirls the musical that is about the Supremes but they do not call them the Supremes. Geffen produced it. She said that at first she was going to sue but then she did not. And Diana tips people herself and does everything herself. it is really great. And as we left New York the skyline was so beautiful. When we got to Atlantic City the guy who met us was somebody who Edmund Gaultney had brought to the office once. He took us to the Golden Nugget and it turns out his brother Steve Wynn owns it. He was there with his wife and kids and they are a good-looking American family-I could not tell if they were Italian or Jewish. And Diana could not decide which of two outfits to wear. I said I would be her hairdresser and decide but then I could not decide either. She finally put on a skimpy white dress but then later changed her mind and wore tight black pants and a top. So I got a tour of the Golden Nugget and that was exciting. There were literally eighteen restaurants and Victorian was the style for everything. I asked the guy why everything was Victorian and he said nobody gambled if it looks modern. We went up an escalator five stories high. They said they would send a plane for me whenever I wanted but when I said I was not a gambler they dropped me. Diana is a big gambler though but she has not gambled there yet. Then they said that Frank Sinatra always goes on on time and so we got to the room and it is about 500 seats. They sell 200 and then give 300 to the high rollers. Frank came on and he did all his songs and it was great. And he introduced Diana Ross and me in the audience he said ""We have two fabulous famous people in the audience each in their own fields one an artist one a singer"" and the introduction went on for a long time. And Barbara Sinatra was between us. She was wearing a little black dress she looks great. I could not think of what to say so I asked her if her son was still dating Barbara Allen although I knew he was not. Afterward we went to their suite and for the first time Frank shook hands with me. And gee he looks great. How old is he? About sixty-seven? And he does not wear a toupee. I am sure. I am an expert and I really would say absolutely not-I think he is maybe had transplants and that they look really good. And the tailor was there measuring for suits and he was straight but he was kissing and hugging all these guys like a gay seamstress. It was so camp. And I did not have my camera so I did not take pictures but anybody who tried to the security people put their hands over the camera in sort of a great way. Frank said he was doing a song on his next album with Michael Jackson and Diana said ""Why do not you do one with we?"" When Diana and I were alone for a moment I told her that there were so many people with ""funny names"" here and she pushed her nose sideways and said ""You mean like this?"" And it was funny it looked so Mafia. Home at 12:00."

Went with Ken. he is nice but he is real slow. But he is a better walker than Tony because he picks out good-looking Interview-type people and hands the magazine to them. Mathilda Cuomo was there. After that I cabbed to Chris Makos's to photograph more nudes ($4 modeling fees $300). Did that from 1-3:00 and while I was there I heard Chris call Paige so I got on the phone to tell her that La Vie en Rose might want to advertise and she started screaming at me that I had not shown up for an important advertising lunch and it was like having a nagging wife. And then she accused me of just being down at Chris's to take male porno photographs which I was but I mean it was for work! I mean I am just trying to work and make some money. I mean there is a lot of hungry mouths to feed at the office! I have a business to keep going! I mean the porno pictures are for a show. they are work.

Lunch was for Lewis Allen the producer and somebody who works with him and I would invited Princess Pignatelli and her husband when we would run into them at Mr. Chow's. And Bianca called and said she was coming down with John Samuels to meet Lewis Allen. Lewis Allen was seeing me because he wants to produce a Broadway ""evening"" with me like an ""evening"" with the Beatles you know? One where I sit and read from the Philosophy book. In the sixties Lewis Allen tried to buy the rights to Clockwork Orange for us to make into a movie. He produced Annie and things and his wife is Jay Presson Allen she writes screenplays like Funny Lady."

The Love Boat writers are working on my episode which is going to film on March thirtieth and I started to get scared I do not know if I can go through with it. The guy was really gay. And Joan Collins got done shooting and I said hi and she said I still owed her a painting. She was great. And Ali McGraw waved. There were like 500 people there working. And it is directed by Curtis Harrington who was an underground filmmaker in the sixties who did voodoo kind of stuff and now he is doing this. Then we went to the Interview offices and I got excited about Interview. I think I do want to buy a building out there because they will only give you leases to rent for a few months. Gael said that Third Street is going to be the next street that is big. I got excited on Melrose. Jon's trying to move into production at Paramount so he has to be out here more. And gee I can not believe that it gets dark here at the same time it does in New York. It seems like since it is sunny it should stay light longer. I was shocked. Then we went out to the premiere of the redone Wings that Paramount was releasing and it was absolutely great. And you look and you think why can not they make movies like this now. Buddy Rogers who was married to Mary Pickford was there. And Clara Bow was just great in it. The fashions look like today. And it was a big event. Got home around 11:30 or 12:00.

So an era has ended. I guess I will just be going straight to work which is just as well I will get more work done. There are other possibilities of people to try out but Benjamin was special. George the secretary at Yoko Ono's called and invited me to a dinner party for her big screening of the movie she and John made in 1972 and a benefit concert at Madison Square Garden I think for Bangladesh. And there were a lot of other things to do but I decided to do that. I asked if I could bring someone to Yoko's and later they called and said okay so I asked Sam Bolton. he is only interested when it is big celebrities. Was picked up by Sam and we cabbed to Amsterdam and 64th or 65th for the screening and I was next to Jann Wenner (cab $4). And John was such a great comedian so natural on stage and those funny little movements and good lines. Yoko was just screaming it was one of her early performances. Then there was a dinner at Jezebel's and Jann gave us a ride in his limo. Roberta Flack was there and Earl and Camilla McGrath and we all walked in and they were shocked with this glamorous place that they did not know about. Jezebel redid it and it looks cleaner now. She kissed me hard on my cheek. I was next to Roberta Flack and one of the Spinks brothers came in wearing a big fur coat. And Michael Douglas came later. And I guess I do not know how to talk to little Sean Lennon. I am too abstract. Because Roberta Flack was so great with him. He said ""Roberta what is a torch singer?"" And she said ""Well Sean a torch singer is someone who sings with not too much music playing very softly and with a lot of feeling."" And then he felt he understood. The sweet potato pie was really good and then I realized it must have had bacon lard in the crust. Afterwards Jann Wenner offered me a ride home and so Sam and I went with him and I said he did not have to drive Sam downtown that he would get out on 66th Street with me and just get a cab home and Jann made comments like he did not care what I did in my private life. So we got out at 66th and Park and I gave Sam money to get a cab and I walked home ($5)."

The play is three couples arguing a lot. Irene was really good but somehow she just can not get a big hit.

He arrived with a boyfriend just one of his friends and he was intimidated by the place-Halston was dressing the Disco Queen in a coat he would made for her that day and she came down the stairs and Halston was saying [imitates] ""Come on Disco Queen."" He talks like baby talk. He did not put any feathers in her hair this time. I told him he could not that the newspapers would not take her picture if she put one more feather in her hair. And then Nastase's boyfriend decided not to come to Studio 54 with us and when we got in the limo Halston was yelling at the driver because he could not find the black radio station he said ""What do you mean you do not know where the black station is-you are black are not you?"" And then the driver said he could not see meaning the radio dial and Halston said ""What do you mean you can not see you are driving are not you?"" and then he told me that you have to yell at the help or they do not respect you. He has over a hundred people working for him and they are all so terrified of him they are always asking each other what kind of a mood he is in. And I noticed something-Bianca had two blemishes on her face! she is never had a blemish! I guess she is depressed about Mick discoing the night away. She stays out until 6:00 then gets up for her 8:00 exercise class."

No one at the office knows except Gael and Robert and Fred. And I hear he has the agent named Janklow a big literary lawyer. I wonder if Jann Wenner's offered him a job because he is been having meetings with him lately but I do not think so because they would never get along. I am happy for Bob. Really I am. But I mean he should have kept working until we found a replacement. it is awful of him to just leave with no notice. Fred called and talked to him but nothing changed. I think Thomas Ammann must have encouraged him. Thomas has gotten so grand too. I mean I see people that I knew so long ago and suddenly they have airs. So nobody at the office knows except the people I said. But (laughs) everybody outside the office knows. But this has been building up for a while. Before Bob went away for the holidays I would told him he could have any painting he wanted for Christmas and he said a Hammer & Sickle and I only have two of those and I said ""Gee Bob just anything but that"" and he got mad. But Bob has gotten so grand he goes to these rich people's places and he thinks he should have it all too. But magazine editors do not make that much. And Bob made so much off other things- he got commissions on the portraits and he has 50 percent of that Bruno photography portfolio. But what he really wanted was 50 percent of Interview-at least I think he said 50 I could not really hear if he was saying 50 or 15. I told him then that he could have a percentage of the profits when Interview started making some profits but it is not making any yet. And then he said that it was. But it is just not. And if Bob was smart he could have just hired someone to do the routine things that he does for Interview and just overseen the magazine do it freelance. I think maybe that is what Fred's going to ask him to do. Anyway I think he will be back. And John Powers brought a possible portrait by-a plastic surgeon from Horida. And Mr. LeFrak came while they were there and John was great he embarrassed Mr. LeFrak into finally accepting the portraits-he told him what more do you want and then later he told me ""I can not believe you made him look so good."" So I got home about 7:00 dropped Jay (cab $5). Decided to stay home talked on the phone to Christopher and Fred. You know about Bob leaving it is not about money because he was making a lot. And it is not about the Hammer & Sickle because if it was not about that it would have been about something else. he is been leading up to this for a long time. Maybe he is going into business with Thomas Ammann too. Because Bob is good at selling art. If a person says they do not want a portrait Bob will just make a face and walk away. And he is not shy about asking people to pay their bills. Even Fred is a little shy about that. But Bob is not. If he is got a good new job I am happy for him. He just should not have quit with no notice. that is the bad thing it is not professional."

Paige was in a really bad mood because I had Sam dial her number and make the arrangements to go to the Mary Tyler Moore play that Barry Tubbs is in-she came over and said that she did not want my little messengerettes calling her for me. She really has another personality when she wants to she can really be mean. Oh and Len Morgan came back from his ten-day cruise with Thurn und Taxis so he was answering the phones. And the prince still makes up stories about me. He told Len that once I said to him ""If you are supposed to be so exciting do something exciting"" and that then I stepped on his toes. Which I do not remember at all. Went to the theater (cab $4). Lynn Redgrave is a good actress because she played down her role to give Mary Tyler Moore the stage. And the other young guy in the play showed his cock and then afterwards at the party his parents said how (laughs) proud they were of him."

Each room was done in a different style. One room was English the other room was Art Deco the next room was trompe l'oeil. There was no food. Just three pieces of chicken sushi. I found some caviar on a tray in the corner of a room where you would never look. And there was a black girl there who was one of these over-bubbly girls that I can not stand-from Africa she said but then she said it was so good to be out with people because she lives so shut up in Greenwich with her family so what do you suppose that means? She said she went to the best London schools. And I guess Michael Douglas likes black girls because he said ""Listen sweetheart give me your number before you leave"" and when he got up to do something he told her ""I will be right back."" Earl McGrath was there sour until he finally got a joint from John Taylor of Duran Duran. And then he introduced me to Randy Hearst Patty's father and then it turned out Patty was there with her cop husband and I met him and then Patty came over and was very friendly and sweet she looks great. And Nile Rodgers was there the record producer. he is a fashion plate his hair's cut square like Grace Jones's and he is really nice."

And then about 6:00 I heard fumbling at the door and it was Fred trying to get his keys into the lock and it took him half an hour to make it in and I was going to get up and tell him off but I was in a stupor. It was raining horrible and grey and cold really freezing. We were going to Monte Carlo for the joint show of Jamie Wyeth and me. Finally we got there and it was sunny and beautiful. And the first people we ran into were Pam Combemale-her unmarried name is Woolworth-and Jamie Wyeth they had just come in on the Concorde. And they would lost Jamie's clothes and Phyllis's luggage so she had nothing to wear. Went down to the lobby at 6:00 and saw the exhibition they were putting it together. I did an interview for Time magazine and then we went to this restaurant that looks just like Trader Vic's called Mona's. The Portanovas were there and Liz Smith and Iris Love and the Larsens and there was a lot of dancing going on and Jamie was so great he was dancing with Phyllis and I was drunk so I went over to them and I fell down. With them. And then I was dancing with everybody else-all the girls-and it was a new thing for me. I would had two vodkas and that must have set me off. Jamie's so much fun because he is a troublemaker. he is always saying mean things about people-like he said this one lady's pockmarks made her face look like a used dartboard. He just goes right down the line tearing everybody apart he is very funny.

I asked him to come to the room to chit-chat and he said no that he just wanted to ""go home and go to bed."""

It was like the TV people asked them where they were going to steal next so they could set up. On TV they are all chained together and they are all black and Puerto Rican. It looks like Roots. Maxime de la Falaise called the Factory to see if there was electricity there. she is been moving down to her loft on 19th Street from the Upper West Side all week. She tried to save money by getting hippie movers and it is taken a week instead of a day. The hippies carry things out leisurely and look at chairs and ask each other ""How old do you think this is? Eighteenth century?"" Professional movers just crate up dead bodies if that is what you have in your apartment they do not miss a beat. Had dinner with Sharon Hammond and Robin Lehman and afterwards we walked down Eighth Avenue through the drag queens and transvestites and whores over to Studio 54. Steve Rubell was thrilled to see us and let all ten of us in free. He reminded me that I would asked him to marry me a few weeks ago and I could not believe he would remember something casual and offhand like that. I said it once and did not even think he heard me. I mean he is a young kid doing well being successful-I am so tired of working I propose all the time to people who're doing well. Why would he remember that as if it was serious?"
"Thursday, July 14, 1983","[Dick Tracy, Farrah Fawcett, Paul Morrissey, Susan Sarandon]",0.09438657407407407,We took our time getting to the theater to see Farrah Fawcett in Extremities. We thought we had plenty of time but when we got there they were holding the curtain for us. Farrah was good but not as good as Susan Sarandon had been. And it is funny I had not liked Susan Sarandon in anything except The Other Side of Midnight until then but then I saw that she was really good. Some girls tried to pick Benjamin and me up. Then after the play we saw Farrah and Ryan backstage and they were gushy. it is so hard to talk to actors all they want is to talk about themselves. And Ryan looks a little older he is getting the same lines I have. And he was talking about Paul Morrissey and telling me I should work with him again. And he really wants the part of Dick Tracy that Warren Beatty's supposed to get. Ryan thought Jon was an important figure at Paramount so he was hustling him. Jon said they would jogged together once on the beach at Malibu.
"Thursday, July 16, 1981",[],0.29583333333333334,At the party after the screening of Endless Love I talked to Don Murray and I said that I would just read in the paper that Liza was thinking of doing a remake of Bus Stop and I said that if she at her age could play the girl then he could still play the virgin cowboy and that he should go find her and tell her. And he laughed. he is still so good-looking and tall.

And there was a big rainstorm with big hailstones and that was exciting. We ran around with buckets putting them under all the holes in the roof. Worked with Rupert until 8:00. Then I went to dinner with Susan Mulcahy of the Post's Page Six. And you know I realized watching her last night that she is gotten more tough. she is still sweet and everything but the job has put her into a power position which is weird. She does have to fill up the page and I see her becoming more like Bob when Bob got aggressive and tough. She acts more like a man now and she is now accepting the idea that she is beautiful.
"Thursday, July 17, 1986","[Jim Beam, Keith Richards, Patti Hansen, Ric Ocasek, Ron Delsener, Ron Wood, Tom Petty]",0.08344155844155843,"Worked till 7:00. And then Ric Ocasek was picking us up to take us over to Madison Square Garden. Ric has a girlfriend Paulina who is a big model and Czechoslovakian and her mother was with them and she looks even younger than the daughter. And I guess maybe I am not really Czech because I did not understand it when they were talking. And we went to the Garden and I did not know this could be done but the limo drove right into the Garden. You drive right (laughs) onto the stage. Yes you really do. Ric and Dylan have the same manager. And he kept saying to me ""You have total freedom total freedom. Go anywhere take pictures anywhere-in the bathrooms on the stage anyplace."" And they took us into the room and Dylan was there and Tom Petty and Ron Wood. And Tom Petty's daughter was around or maybe it was his wife. She looked just like him. And Dylan looks good he had silver-tipped cowboy boots on and he was drinking Jim Beam. And even though they would told me I had ""total freedom"" I am glad I asked before I took a picture of the three of them there because Dylan said no. And then later Ric found out that Dylan was in a bad mood because he had just had a big fight with his girlfriend who is forty or fifty who I think works for the record company and at the end of the fight she would said something to him like ""Oh go out and play your 'Mr. Tambourine Man' or whatever."" And that would kill your mood-when your lover calls all your work you have done in your life (laughs) ""whatever."" So I guess he was left without an ego with a show to do. And the Pressman kid who owns Barneys was there he would been at the MTV party the night before he goes to all these music things I do not know why. I lied and told him that I would seen the Statue of Liberty windows at Barneys. I did not get any good pictures really so I just took four rolls of atmosphere. And Ron Delsener was running he went crazy at the end because if you go past 11:00 then it costs $1000 extra a minute for the unions. Afterwards at that new restaurant on 81st and Columbus Metropolis Dylan came in with his whole family-all his kids and his mother who was nice-looking with white hair. She did not look Jewish but everybody else did. I asked Dylan's manager if Dylan was Christian now or Jewish again and he said Dylan's Orthodox and that is why he was not doing a show the next night-that he did not work Friday nights unless the money was really good. Keith Richards was supposed to come to the concert but Patti Hansen was having their baby. Oh also the road manager liked Ric Ocasek's girlfriend Paulina's mother and so she was giving him her address. He was Indian. Paulina said ""we have got to get my mother laid before she has to leave New York."""

Went past the Beaubourg. Bought some magazines and Vogues ($8). Went by the Flore but it was closed. Made dinner plans to meet Anthony Russell and Florence Grinda at Castel's. he is still working on his rock and roll. Cabbed to Castel's ($3). There were Florence and Anthony and Florence's brother and a big beautiful model named Margo. Mick and Jerry arrived. Mick has a beard. Jerry's wearing some pearls that he gave her. And he is making a record. They were talking about Anita Pallenberg's seventeen-year-old boyfriend killing himself on the bed. Jerry was in between going back and forth to Houston working in the John Travolta movie Urban Cowboy. She was thrilled about that said John was just adorable. We all chipped in for dinner. Fred walked me home. Sat up reading called Curley to find out what was happening in New York-he was off to Bermuda because his family's caretaker there died.

But after I was thinking about it I think they just want to buy it to get rid of the competition. I do not know how much he would offer. Nobody was around. Fred was in L.A. and Vincent was at lunch so I did not want to hear any offer. he is coming to lunch again and Fred will be there. I showed him old art and new art and he is interested in a Natalie. He said to stretch it for him.

And he always thinks I am abstract because I never know who he is. His name's Fred. he is a friend of Jay Shriver's girlfriend Karen Moline. I went to Mick and Jerry's party at Mr. Chow's (cab $7.50). I had fun chatting about abortions and sex but I have to get off those subjects and talk about politics or something because when I read interviews that I do the questions I ask are so awful. Stupid. Somebody besides me if they could spend a day taping the person would do a better job. I am down on myself.

When it is the same nurse it is not so bad but Rosemary is away and Doc Cox has a male assistant and so (laughs) it felt like you were at the Anvil. First I got a pelvic X-ray and then a proctoscopy that is what it is called and it was too embarrassing. Doc Cox went out of the room to see a lady patient and she spilled water on him so when he came back it looked like he would peed on himself. The Doc was sweet. Then I picked up some things for the office ($15.21) and got down there by 2:30. The lunch was for Eartha Kitt and Barry Landau had brought Polly Bergen down too. Brigid had already done her Eartha Kitt imitation for Eartha and Ronnie was looped saying it was his ""last day"" on the job-Fred had screamed at him the day before that the place was too dirty that he was not cleaning up enough. Ronnie and Eartha were fighting and nobody pulled him out of the room. The fight was over James Dean's personality and whether he was ""difficult."" I guess Eartha was thinking she was a rebel too so she was standing up for James Dean and it is not the same thing at all-she did it for civil rights and James Dean was just a person not showing up for work. And the fight would not have been bad if Polly Bergen had not started sticking up for Ronnie saying he was right and then when Polly left the room Eartha said something like that she was full of shit and then when Eartha stepped away once Polly said something like the same thing about Eartha but not in those words. Bob thought Eartha was interesting enough to do a story on but I do not want to hear about the White House that story's so old I do not want to hear about it. We made a date for the next day at Quo Vadis to have lunch with her and her daughter Kitt and I gave Bob the assignment of keeping Barry away. And Ronnie decided to stay on. Victor did not come by to see me so that was like a vacation but he sent me over a present-a cock ring his. We tried to get Truman on the phone but he did not answer. Got dressed and picked up Catherine. Her English friend Jamie Neidpath was with her he is a land baron. He looks twenty but he is thirty. He dresses in funny clothes long stringy silk ties like the Beatles used to wear and frock coats and I asked him why he dressed funny and he said because he just decided once that this was the way he was going to dress forever and so he has. Cabbed to the Bottom Line ($6). Steve Paul was there I think he manages David Johansen. Lou Reed was at the next table and Catherine was madly in love with him that was why she wanted to come to this thing. And Fran Lebowitz was at another table with her arm around some girl (laughs) so I got a few snaps of that. And oh David Johansen is so cute he is just so adorable. The only thing he does wrong is jump around he should learn not to do that like Lou learned not to. Lou invited us over to his place. it is on Christopher Street between Sixth and Seventh sort of where the Voice used to be upstairs from a bagel store. When we were going in the kids around were whispering ""there is Lou Reed."" He tells them ""Go kill yourself."" is not that great? The two dachshunds he got after he saw me with mine are so adorable-Duke and Baron. he is sort of separated from Rachel the drag queen but not completely they have separate apartments. Where Lou is it is actually more of a house. it is a rent-controlled thing he got from a girlfriend six rooms and he only pays $485 a month. The best room is a long skinny bathroom 2' X 12' and he said he was thinking of changing it but I said not to that it is really great that way. And oh Lou's life is everything I want my life to be. I mean every room has every electronic gadget in it-a big big big big TV a phone answerer that you hear when the phone rings tapes TVs Betamaxes and he is so sweet and so funny at the same time so together it is just incredible. And his house is very neat. He has a maid come in ... well I guess it does smell a little of dog shit but... Then he was on the phone and he ran a tape of his concert and it was him trying to get the old Billy Name Factory Foto look very contrasty. Catherine went downstairs and got grapefruit juice and bagels and orange juice. Lou only had a funny pint-size bottle of scotch."

Lunch for Christopher Wilding and his stepsister the adopted Liz Taylor-Richard Burton girl she was pretty but not a raving beauty about sixteen shy. Firooz Zahedi was there and the Blondie girl was being interviewed and photographed by Chris Makos. Her real name is Debbie Harry she is been around for a long time sort of on the fringes. She knows everybody. If she had a body like Cyrinda's she would be really great although her body's okay like a Sandra Dee-Tuesday Weld-type body. she is small. Allen Midgette came up earlier to show his wares he is making leather clothes and he really works hard on them. He stayed for lunch. He keeps in shape dancing. We reminisced about the sixties when I sent him on that college lecture tour with Paul and Viva to impersonate me and then the places found out and made me redo the whole tour.

The sky darkened and the rain came and it was the most incredible thing I have ever seen. Just the event of the century-her hair blowing and soaking wet and if only they would had a covering on the place where she was she could have kept on singing and the kids would have stayed and she would have had her concert for TV. But they stopped it in the middle of the storm and they are going to do it again tomorrow. She was crying and Barry Diller was trying to get her to stop but she said that she would waited for twenty years to do this. The lightning made it dangerous I guess but it was like a dream like a hallucination watching this spectacle. It was like the greatest scene from a movie ever. When they do her life story in the movies you can just see this huge event and then later she is crying and saying ""Why did this happen to me?"" and then drinking and slitting her wrists. But oh the thunder and lightning looked so great. So beautiful. We were in the VIP area but because I would had Benjamin bring an umbrella we were not sitting under the canopy. And Rob Lowe was with us and he is so beautiful. it is like his eyebrows are penciled on and his lips painted on-everything so perfect. And he is just like the kids we know just regular and he is looking for girls that is all he can think about. I asked him to draw me a pussy and he drew a pussy and then I said ""what is that?"" and I then drew him a cat. And he and his girl friend are sort of breaking up because whenever she called him on location in Canada the operator would say ""he is in Nastassia Kinski's room"" so then when he would tell her the next day that his phone had been out of order she would tell him to stop lying. And he says he is not in love with Nastassia though that it is just sex. But he was wearing a toy snake around his waist which was a joke on her Avedon poster so he was thinking about her so maybe he is in love. he is nineteen. And he was just after any old lady. Just anybody. Like Susan Sarandon. She was there with Richard Gere and Silvinha. And oh you should have seen it. Jerry Zipkin in the soaking rain. And I felt so sorry for Jon because he is worked so hard on this because Paramount owns Showtime which got the film rights. And then finally people were leaving the park and so we followed the blacks and wound up coming out at 72nd Street near the Dakota. And we had to climb a wall and fall into three feet of mud. It was like being in a war zone. And then after we got out of the park I took Rob Lowe and Benjamin to Cafe Central-I said all the stars go there Matt Dillon and Sean Penn-and then we got there and had drinks and absolutely nobody was there (drinks $83.50). Then I got home and called Rob Lowe at the Sherry and he said that he was waiting for a phone call from Nastassia so that I should just go ahead without him over to the Gulf + Western building for the party. So I went and when I got there he was getting out of the cab. So that was kind of mean. I was hurt. I guess he did not want to be seen with us again because we were being campy and outrageous. And I said to him you know ""I just was going to give you a ride that is all-it was no big deal."" And Cornelia had been at the park too. And a newspaper photographer took her and pushed her next to one of the people who were stabbed just to get that kind of a picture of a socialite and a stabbed person. Cornelia did not know what was going on. And at the party at the Gulf + Western Rob was after Cornelia and Maura. He and Cornelia kept going off alone. I gave Diana Ross a Diamond painting. She was looking at tapes of the concert. Barry Diller came over and I told him the concert was so great and he said ""You always like disasters. You liked Grease II."" Harvey Mann who works for Liz Smith was there and he was asking me if I would heard anything more about Calvin and AIDS. He said that they would killed the rumor in their column. And then Calvin came in and he kissed me so hard and his beard was stubbly and I was so afraid that it was piercing into my pimple and being like a needle and giving me AIDS. So if I am gone in three years ... And by the way Rob Lowe also said that up in Canada where they were all shooting Hotel New Hampshire Jodie Foster was reading the Philosophy book."

He tried to be artistic and he sure was he sure was. This is the Shoes with the diamond dust. He had them completely finished with the diamond dust on and everything. I do not know why he did that. I am doing shoes because I am going back to my roots. In fact I think maybe I should do nothing but (laughs) shoes from now on.

I think Fred wants Miller. But I am having a Piss painting show in October at Larry Gagosian's great new gallery in the Sandro Chia building on 23rd Street and there is also a Dia show in October and I think having so much going on at once is too put-downable so maybe the photography show should be later. Anthony d'Offay came by with his wife and if they are so rich I do not know why she is missing a tooth. Their seventeen-year-old son sent me a letter that was simple and so adoring and it shows what you can say with a letter it was so effective. He mentions Billy Boy though so I do not know if he has a problem. I was supposed to be picked up by limo for Elliott Erwitt's photo for Travel and Leisure. They decided they wanted Grace too so then it became Waiting for Grace. The kids got me a cab and we went up to Erwitt's apartment on Central Park West because he had called and said the light was going not to wait for Grace. Grace lives down by the Anvil. She arrived and even if she is the latest person in the world she is sweet and she was fun. She thinks we should become a couple and that she could make me happy. Can you imagine her cocaine friends running through my house? She still can not get over Dolph dumping her and she said he is not going to make it without her and I think she is right he should have gotten more out of her before dumping her. She says he goes around the swimming pools in his little shorts and the girls go crazy. And she was complaining because Jean-Paul Goude does not even see their kid who is five or six now. Grace felt he needed a father figure though so she (laughs) found a fairy to live in.

And I told him that even though I have not been to see him for a while I have been examined by insurance company doctors so not to worry. These kids looked great until a real model came along and then you could see the difference and you realize that a model is a model. Then I took everybody over to the Palladium for the sixties party there and it was easy to get them all in because Steve Rubell was right at the door. So we went in and God I hate that place so packed so hot. And I never sweat. Never. But at this thing I started to a little. Every girl who said hello was an ""Edie."" And somehow they never get the hair right-Edie's was straight back and dyed like a boy and really white but they usually give themselves bangs or something. Everybody gets the Edie look wrong and I do not know why. They do something different that is not the way (drinks $20).

Halston was the leader and Steve just did not know who to tip he was just bad at it being so ungenerous-he really is a cheapo. He knows exactly how much things are worth he just does not want to give it-he wants to keep it I think. I just can not understand that. After Halston paid his bill he screamed telling the guy how dirty and unbeautiful and how did they really think a hotel could go on like this with service so bad. I asked him how could he do that and he said ""you have got to do that you have got to always keep them on their toes and pretend you are rich really really rich."" He kept screaming at the place and nobody wanted to give any tips. We snuck out because we are never going to stay there again a dump. I mean it was $2600 for two people in two dumb rooms without even ordering up anything. We got to the airport in time the Savoy had a nice man waiting there to check you in. I gave him $15. Got on the plane very easy. Then we arrived in Paris forty minutes away. Victor forgot to get his visa so he was stuck at customs. We waited for him. Steve said ""is not that Jerry Hall?"" She was just coming in from Houston from the John Travolta movie. it is Mick's birthday in a few days and she was going to take him to some chic restaurant. Finally Victor got out of customs. Limo waiting there for us (baggage $5). Hotel Plaza-Athenee. Weather beautiful. Very beautiful best suite. The only thing Halston wanted to do in Paris was get his dog a piece of Vuitton. Luggage for Linda. Victor fought with driver. He screamed and jumped out and said he would never see us again. Halston was fun buying shoes at Hermes he said he never shops which he does not-he really does not have time. Limoed to Club Sept. Victor called me there and said he would calmed down said he would come in a costume but he came normal. Then limoed to the Palace. Halston had called ahead and said ""Mr. Steve Rubell of Studio 54 will be coming by your club tonight-of course you will want to let him and his party in free."" I got the driver in with us because I felt bad for him because of Victor's fight. Victor got one of the waiters to loan him his outfit and so Victor went around taking everyone's orders."

People on TV always get some part wrong like-""In the future fifteen people will be famous."" Oh and I forgot to say that Truman really is looking more and more like his bulldog. He sits there and rubs his eyes as if he were kneading dough and then he takes his hands away and they are all red-the whites are red the rims are red he really looks like his dog really drooping."

And it was fun talking to Berkeley she is given up being an actress and now she may be a cartoonist. She left camp ten days early. It was one of those ones where you milk cows and feed chickens. Dropped them off ($6) and then went with Curley to 33rd and First Avenue to pick up this friend of his and it was a little brownstone and he is 6'6"" and sleeping on the floor and the place is a mess and it is fun to see how kids really live who go out looking so chic in Brooks Brothers clothes and velvet slippers and here they are living in a hot box. Went to Xenon (cab $6). Howard Stein was there. And Cornelia Guest had called and invited me to a party at his place on Sunday in East Hampton. he is using Cornelia to get into East Hampton society and (laughs) she is using him to get into Xenon. Oh and Bob is being so grand he will not tell me any inside gossip about the Bloomingdale thing. It was in the papers yesterday that now Alfred Bloomingdale's mistress Vicki Morgan is suing his wife Betsy because she said it was Betsy who made Alfred stop sending her money.

Philip's doing the new AT&T building at 56th on Madison. After dinner we went up to the apartment where David and Philip are living on Fifth opposite the Met the one that Philip did the front of. And Philip and David are unhappy with their apartment-it is small there is no room for paintings but they have my Cows in the bedroom and twenty Jasper Johns prints up. I like the apartment it is neat and orderly. David's really good about throwing things out-if he buys five new shirts he throws five old ones away. And their places always have nothing in them no knick-knacks no flowers no food in the refrigerator. Oh but I did see some underwear on a chair and I was going to say something about it because it was the first time I have ever seen a piece of clutter in their apartment. Their limo dropped us.

Steve Aronson was there doing a story for Vanity Fair on the gallery and he would also just finished an article on Stuart for Architectural Digest. And Stuart for weeks had been playing it so cool telling me how he did not really want the publicity how he wanted to stay ""low profile"" how he just wanted to be a ""private person"" but then when he was talking to Steve you could see he wanted it desperately. Anyway the photography show they had there was so interesting and I would forgotten (laughs) you can steal ideas. I liked the ones where Bruce Weber had the dyed colors-blue pink ... I guess it is like they used to do with sepia. And superimpositions are coming back. Paige is using that new Polaroid like crazy the flashes are starting to bother my eyes. I did not send Liza a note or anything when her father died on Friday. I thought it would fade away and I could say I did not know about it but they are making a big thing so I will have to write something but what? Maybe do another picture of him. But I have already done so many. And then I noticed the weird thing Stuart does with his hands-he exercises each finger like the piano players do. Like the tendon in the middle fingers he says goes all the way to the back. And he had me feel his fingers he is been doing it about four months and they feel like claws. I could not even move them. The Pace-MacGill guy came by and it is so weird being wanted by two galleries at once that is never happened like this before and they are both offering the same things and it is like having two boyfriends or girlfriends after you. What do you do?"
"Thursday, July 4, 1985","[Anne Bass, Leonard Stern, Peter Brant, Philippe Junot, Stephen Sprouse]",-0.008310439560439567,"Stayed home during the day the dog was sick. Watched the soaps and they are all great handsome guys and good-looking girls and they really know how to kiss. The Forbes boat was parked at 30th Street and the East River not the Hudson River like I thought. And when Stephen Sprouse and Cornelia and I got there there were all people on the highway screaming my name as I went in so that distracted me and I did not take pictures. Peter Brant was on the boat he told me that he would tried to buy the Voice that he would really wanted it but that he lost out when Leonard Stern paid $55 million because he would only offered $51 million. Anne Bass was there with her husband Sid and kids and I did not make a fuss over them which I should have. I sat with Mick and Jerry while I ate. Watched the fireworks and it was like they were floating by the boat. ""Suzy"" was there with her son and I did not know she had one. Then the boat left and sailed around the tip of Manhattan up to where it usually docks on 23rd Street in the Hudson. Going fourteen miles an hour. And Cornelia's still with Philippe Junot and Mrs. Vreeland is mad at her for wasting her life which she is but she says she does not want to get married she just wants to have fun. After I got home Stephen called and said ""Thank you for a really good time"" and for a few seconds I (laughs) could not think who it was."
"Thursday, July 6, 1978","[Barry Landau, Henry Ford, Kitt McDonald]",0.09007936507936508,The woman from Detroit called and said the Henry Ford portrait is on for later in the month. Oh God Detroit. Maybe Henry Ford's neighborhood will be okay. When I got home Barry Landau called and said he was uptown and he would pick me up to see Timbuktu. We went backstage and I gave Eartha some Interviews told her we would like to take pictures of her daughter Kitt McDonald and do an interview with her. We saw the show drinks at intermission ($10). Barry's been walking Eartha's saint bernard and he did not tell her but he and his friend Greg or Craig took the saint bernard down to Christopher Street for a gay walk.
"Thursday, July 7, 1977","[Barbara Allen, Governor Carey, Marina Schiano, Mayor Beame, Otto Preminger, Suzie Frankfurt]",0.009964842662211077,"Bob and I cabbed to the Pierre Hotel for the lunch in honor of the empress of Iran. There were demonstrators out front and it was scary they wore masks but they were Iranians you could tell because their hands were dark. We were special so we went to shake hands with the empress- the you know queen. Governor Carey and Mayor Beame were in the receiving line and Zahedi. The queen was reading a prepared speech and it was going along okay and then a woman in a green dress in the press section stood up and screamed ""Lies lies you liar!"" and they dragged her out. The queen kept on reading her prepared statements and then afterwards apologized to everyone for the noise and demonstrations that were going on because of her. She said that women's rights in Iran may not seem so much to Americans but in Iran it was big steps. Cabbed to meet Ronnie ($2.50) and look at uncut stones for my Diamond paintings. Then cabbed down to the office ($3). Cabbed up to the Iranian embassy ($2.50). There were no demonstrators out in front. Inside I saw Otto Preminger again and it was the second or third time in a few days so he asked me what we were going to do tomorrow. I posed for pictures with the queen in front of my portrait of her. She said she was jealous of Hoveyda because he had eight Warhols and she only had four. The queen is taller than me. Cab to Marina Schiano's for dinner ($3). Francoise de la Renta was there she put the Shah down saying he was greedy and awful but she said she liked the queen. She said he had twenty-five mistresses an hour. Suzie Frankfurt was there. Bob was in the bedroom where there was coke. Giorgio Sant'Angelo came in and then Suzie and I were sitting right there and Giorgio says to Bob ""Who is this Suzie Frankfurt?"" This is that thing that people on drugs do. it is just like they do in Hollywood when they do not like somebody-they talk about them as if they were not there. In a way it is great-if it could only happen more. Marina and Giorgio are the ones who really do it a lot. I said ""Suzie they are talking about you!"" Bob said to Giorgio ""she is a good friend of Andy's it is all right."" ""But who is she?"" Giorgio said. ""she is very rich"" Bob said. This is all with us sitting right there with Giorgio and Bob acting as if we could not hear. Finally I said ""Oh come on Bob. you are talking about people in front of them."" Dropped Suzie ($2.70). Barbara Allen told Bob that Mick is very unhappy he says it is over with Bianca that he has no feelings for her. He thinks she uses him and he does not want to go to St. Tropez where she is. Barbara says she just thinks of Mick as a friend the way she thinks of Fred and Bob and that she has sex with him only because he is lonely now."
"Thursday, July 7, 1983","[Alfred Bloomingdale, Richard Weisman, Vicki Morgan]",0.02,Well the news of the day was that Alfred Bloomingdale's Vicki Morgan was found beaten to death. So all I could think of was the CIA. Unless she was in an S&M thing. Catherine called again to try to get me to come to her wedding. I just do not know what to do. I do not want to go. And Halston says he will only go if I go. Richard Weisman is going on Wednesday and he is bringing her Halston wedding dress. Victor wants to go. Catherine says she is saving room in her car for me.
"Thursday, July 9, 1981",[Chris Makos],0.19999999999999998,Halston invited me to Montauk so I am going at 6:30 on Friday with him on his rented plane. it is so nice to be invited to your own house by the person who is renting it-you feel at home and you are still making money. I invited Chris Makos and Jon.

And Robbie Robertson from The Band called wanting me to do a poster for The Last Waltz and so Fred and I were going up there to meet him at his place at the Sherry Netherland to talk about it and when Catherine found out she said that that could be her birthday present. So we all cabbed up at 6:30 traffic was bad ($4). We went up to the Scorsese-Robertson suite-Marty was in Rome visiting (laughs) the grave of Roberto Rossellini. Robbie gave us champagne and then it was the same thing they always say ""Well will you do this art poster for us and then we will sell it for you and is not that wonderful?"" And it is mixed in with hippie talk and phrases and then everyone was too embarrassed to talk about money so finally Fred said ""Look man what is in it for Andy?"" (laughs) Yeah he really said ""man."" Oh and the butler who answered the door was that kid Marty's making the movie about Steven Prince. Then cabbed up to Suzie Frankfurt's ($3.10). Fred and Catherine had a big fight because she was putting down the Jews saying again that if only Hitler had won ... Fred told her how could she say that because she was in a Jewish house. I honestly do not know if Suzie's Jewish or not. I mean she is Catholic now-she got baptized this year. But why would she turn Catholic unless she were Jewish? I do not know I think she is just crazy. Cabbed to the Eberstadts' ($2.00). When we got there only Lord ""Brookie"" was there Harrison Ford and Earl McGrath. Fred was chasing me trying to kiss me I do not know why he was acting out of it weird. And Keiko Carimati broke an antique nutcracker they had it was in three pieces and we did not know whether we should say anything or not. And then Catherine dropped a champagne glass and within a minute Fred dropped one too and there was champagne and glass all over and it was embarrassing. they will probably never ask us over again."
"Thursday, June 11, 1981",[Doc Cox],0.04,Got up and did not have a fever. Had an appointment with Doc Cox (cab $3). He took X-rays the infection was still there. He said not to go to Seattle and California. I was depressed the whole day.
"Thursday, June 13, 1985",[],-0.11666666666666663,"Then got a cab and the driver knew all about me said he would just seen Bad on video and knew all about the building on 33rd Street. He said ""You made my night."" that is a good song title [singing]: ""I made your night I made your night"" so I had to give him a big tip ($7)."
"Thursday, June 14, 1979","[Bill Pitt, Henry Geldzahler, John Fairchild, Pepe Balderago]",-0.016666666666666666,Henry Post called from out in Long Island where he is still recovering from his car crash. He said that his bones were all set and he would gone back on crutches but then when the doctor was examining him he suddenly flipped him over and by mistake rebroke every bone that would been set. he is in terrible pain. And Pepe Balderago put Bill Pitt into St. Vincent's Hospital he is really out-there. John Fairchild Jr. called and invited me to go roller skating Friday night. Cabbed to Pearl's for Curley's birthday ($2). We had a round table with ten boys at it so I had to tell Pearl it was a stag office dinner. Everybody was blond except for Henry Geldzahler and me who were grey. Henry was being very funny showing his commissioner's badge and it was one one-liner after another. he is so funny so bright. I took pictures. Then we went over to Studio 54 and my birthday present to Curley was getting them all in.
"Thursday, June 16, 1977","[Barbara Allen, Dalai Lama, Joel McCleary, Tom Beard]",0.11423232323232323,"I waited for Fred to pick me up to go over to Sloan-Kettering to see Dr. Stone to go under the knife for a biopsy. No Dr. Strong. I got local anesthesia. They did it for half an hour and then they said to go to work. I am still worried they do not know what it is. You get up your nerve to go for a test-you pop the question-and then pretty soon it can be all over they give you the answer and you pop off. So I will let My Dear Diary know soon if the days are numbered. Went to the office ($4) with a bandage on my neck. Bob was interviewing Barbara Allen the next Interview cover girl on Men Women and Love. Tom Beard [a member of Carter's inaugural committee] brought a really interesting guy called Joel McCleary who is the treasurer of the Democratic National Committee and he is around thirty-five. He was the national finance chairman of the Carter campaign. he is trying to get the Dalai Lama back into this country. He said a lot of Tibetan monks work in a prophylactic company in Paterson New Jersey that they take the bus and go make prophylactics. And Barbara Allen said ""You know that is true a lot of prophylactics do say 'Made in New Jersey.' "" Went over to visit Victor at his new loft which just has a bed in the middle with big jars of different kinds of Vaseline around it-he is so much like Ondine."
"Thursday, June 16, 1983","[Frank Zappa, Sandro Chia, Timothy Hutton]",-0.02160027472527473,"Timothy Hutton came to be interviewed by Maura and me. Maura I could tell was not really hot for him the sparks were not flying. But (laughs) I was hot for him. He was so adorable. He looked scruffy. he is just finished Daniel. Frank Zappa came to be interviewed for our TV show and I think that after the interview I hated Zappa even more than when it started. I remember when he was so mean to us when the Mothers of Invention played with the Velvet Underground-I think both at the Trip in L.A. and at the Fillmore in San Francisco. I hated him then and I still do not like him. And he was awfully strange about Moon. I said how great she was and he said ""Listen I created her. I invented her."" Like ""she is nothing it is all me."" And I mean if it were my daughter I would be saying ""Gee she is so smart"" but he is taking all the credit. It was peculiar. Then Stellan from Sweden was waiting and we went over to Sandro Chia's on West 23rd and 10th Avenue. And he has almost the whole building now. He has a lithographic press that he wants other artists to use. I guess he is making it like a foundation a tax thing. And he is supposed to be giving me a picture and that is why I wanted to go over there but he gave me one I did not like. I wanted a Floating Man one. And Benjamin said he looked in Chia's eyes and that they were ""wild eyes."" And afterwards I said to Benjamin ""Well what do you mean?"" I said ""Look into my eyes and what do you see?"" And Benjamin said ""Troubled eyes."" I said ""Oh who do you think you are?"""
"Thursday, June 17, 1982","[Henry Geldzahler, Jay Johnson, Jean Stein, John Reinhold, Marianne Faithfull, Pierre Cardin, Tom Cashin]",0.0,Forgot to say that on Wednesday Jay Johnson brought Marianne Faithfull to the office. He was not drinking but she was and she had I guess a boyfriend with her. And when she got there she was sort of out of it but then she had some wine and by the time they left she was bubbling. Tom Cashin's signed a modeling contract with Pierre Cardin so he travels a lot now. I went out with John Reinhold. We went to the Odeon and Henry Geldzahler was eating alone so we took him to dinner ($198.85). He told stories about Jean Stein and that is when we got the idea that he should tell her I was doing a book on her.
"Thursday, June 18, 1981","[Bill Bradley, Caroline Kennedy, Margaret Truman, Robert Redford, Ted Kennedy, Tip O'Neill]",0.14352623456790123,"Went over to Tiffany's. Paloma's jewelry looks good actually. there is nothing different about it but she does have a look. Elsa's stuff is selling. Margaret Truman's son who we met once was selling envelopes there. Finally talked to Jon. He said it would be okay for me to come over while he packed to go to Robert Redford's Sundance Foundation. So then I got a brainstorm and I went to Cote Basque in the Olympic Tower and got lunches ($25). Cabbed to Jon's ($3). Watched him pack and he threw a tantrum because his Armani pants were one inch too small. I could not believe it. I decided to water his plants. He was getting a 4:30 plane so I dropped him at the Gulf + Western building and went down to the office (cab $6). I have not had any liquor for a while and I feel wonderful. But then I do not know maybe I am high on antibiotics. I do not know what is making me feel good. Went to the Kennedy dinner at the Metropolitan Club. Caroline Kennedy came over and she was so much fun. And Ted Kennedy came over and he was adorable. Caroline was next to a Chinese surgeon who could not see but they said he was still operating. His wife was cutting his food for him. Tip O'Neill gave a speech he was good. He said a twenty-minute joke which actually was not funny but it was great delivery. And Bill Bradley was there he said he had Rauschenberg and me both on his walls. Senator Moynihan's losing weight he was great adorable. This was a $1000-a-plate dinner. They had folk dancing and Irish jigs. Then this Indian called Hassim wanted to dance with Caroline and she turned him down and then he said ""Well maybe you will dance with my son"" and he brought over this really great-looking son. The father said that in the early sixties he was a poet and that he would come to the Factory and that I would ignored him. I do not remember. Then Caroline got really interested in him because he was talking about magic things you know Harvard-style like what a light bulb was before it was a light bulb. The guy's wife looked like me but more refined. Very white skin. Like a Czechoslovakian beauty. I left and went home. I waited for a call from Jon and finally it came at 2:00 and then I could go to sleep."

And Dorothy sent some of that really good candy. Finally I left and went up with the crew to 42nd Street. Why do these crews and everybody always want to go there? I mean there is nothing there. Went home and saw there was a party Mark Goodson was having for Norman Lear so I went over there to One Beekman Place (cab $4). Bianca was there with Carl Bernstein. Cindy and Joey Adams were there and I brought up Roy Cohn and she said he was on his last legs that she would seen him when he came into the city for a small cocktail party someone gave for him. And a lady was there and she said she is so bored since she stopped working and her kids grew up and I said ""Why do not you adopt a Harlem baby?"" I told her how they are so cute and that if you go up there and plunk your money down it is cash and carry."
"Thursday, June 2, 1977","[Joel LeBon, Madame Claude, Maria Niarchos]",0.3791666666666667,-Paris Joel LeBon was shooting me for the Facade cover with Edwige a girl punk (cab to the studio in Trocadero $8). It took Joel three hours to do one shot under very hot lights. At night I stayed home. Bob escorted Bianca to Castel's where he said they ran into Maria Niarchos and her youngest brother Constantin who is sixteen losing his baby fat and he would been to his first whore that afternoon-Barbara told them that but said not to tell. She said that Philip sent the whore from Madame Claude's the best place in Paris. The girl was not too tall not too short not too light not too dark-all on purpose so that Constantin would not get stuck on any one type.
"Thursday, June 2, 1983","[Jane Pauley, Liz Smith, Steve Aronson, Tab Hunter, Tony Perkins]",0.003720238095238104,"Liz Smith did a whole column on Calvin saying that she sat next to him the other night and he absolutely denied the rumor that he had AIDS and that he looked healthy and happy and that he was now off in Morocco. And I forgot to say that yesterday on the Today Show Steve Aronson was on to promote Hype and they quoted my ""In the future everyone will be famous for fifteen minutes"" line. The girl who interviewed him was the blonde who is replacing Jane Pauley for the week. She attacked Steve but he deserved it-he went too far in the book he was too mean. How is it that someone so smart and so funny can not figure out that being mean always backfires? And Chris said that he visited Tony Perkins and Berry. I guess Psycho II will make a lot of money this summer. He said that when Berry went into the other room Tony started pointing to Chris's crotch and saying ""I would like to see you"" and all Chris could say was ""All right Norman."" I never really liked Tony because he treated me badly once when he was with Tab Hunter. At 1:30 Curley called and said he was just sitting there with his dog thinking about me."

I let him run around but I do not know if I should have. Ran into David Whitney and Michael Heizer and they said to come along to the Whitney to look at what they were doing. And I did and I got so jealous. People can walk on it. Silkscreened textures on big pieces of cardboard. Big like a house. And they are just going to throw it out after the show's over. it is a hill formation. And somebody told me that my old friend Ted Carey who I once split the cost for a Fairfield Porter portrait with-he painted us both together-has you-know-what. I left work early (cab $6) and when I got home Paige was calling crying hysterically that the big opening she was having that night for her Mexican artist Julio Galan was banned by the board of directors of the co-op building where she was having it. It was in the same building that got mad when she gave the black graffiti artists a show. I told her that she just had to buck up and reschedule the show someplace else. So I cabbed down to Indochine for a dinner for Elizabeth Saltzman. Shawn Hausman had a beautiful fifties car and after the dinner he drove us over to Area where they had these kids on skateboarding loops. It looks so dangerous like a twenty-five or thirty-foot arc fifteen feet high. One kid fell when the light went in his eye. Wilfredo who used to work for Armani who works for us was there and his brother was picking him up to take him home to New Jersey. Because Wilfredo got kicked out of his apartment and now he is got to go home to New Jersey every night and his mother's very careful and makes his brother come into the city to pick him up and the brother likes it because that way he gets to go to all the clubs with Wilfredo. So then went to the Palladium. Wilfredo's brother drove. Cornelia was there with Philippe Junot. Stayed five minutes and went home (cab $6).
"Thursday, June 22, 1978","[Diana Vreeland, Nicky Haslam, Richard Weisman, Tom Sullivan]",0.14182692307692307,-London-New York London was just so much fun that I had to leave. Fred and Bob stayed on. Nicky Haslam gave a nice dinner for Fred at a restaurant on the King's Road. And I think Fred's really seeing a lot of Diana Vreeland. I mean we see a lot of her and then he stays on and sees even more of her. And I can not figure out why she does not have cancer yet. she is been dyeing her hair now for what seventy years? And I asked her why she does not have wrinkles and she said that her philosophy is to do exactly what she does. Took the Concorde with Richard Weisman. Got home and glued myself went to the bank (cab $5). Tired all day long. Vincent had been out to Montauk said Mr. Winters wants to quit-he does not like Tom Sullivan being out there I guess. Victor called and said he was back with Halston that they were back being really good friends that he had the limousine and he was out shopping and life was wonderful all over again.

Asked Dr. Lyons not to take X-rays and he got mad. He said that I had not had one in ten years. Then went down to the ninth floor to see Dr. Domonkos the skin doctor. Kitty Carlisle Hart was coming out in a sort of disguise and I asked the doctor why she was there and he said he was sending her somewhere else so I do not know what that meant. Had a pimple squeezed. He told me to come back next week. Cabbed to Sloan-Kettering ($2.50) and the waiting room there freaked me out. People with noses cut off. It was so shocking. Dr. Strong took the stitches on my neck out. Talked to Jamie Wyeth who said we could go late to the president's fund-raising thing at the Waldorf. When we got there there were picketers outside and it was like a bad movie. If you saw it in a movie you would not believe it. They had sections for gay protest and sections for abortion. And they had a garbage can with abortions in it. We were up in the balcony. When the president came in he went around and shook every single person's hand in the whole place and that took a few hours. Ann Landers was kind of nutty-acting. She told me that her daughter had a lot of Warhols and she wishes she would gotten on the bandwagon early too. The president made speeches and he had a good writer because the jokes were all good. ""I want my vice-president to be an active one so if any of you have questions on""-he gave a list-""abortion gay rights downtown parking Northern Ireland the Concorde ... just write him letters and he will be happy to clear it up."" Is that the first time a president has ever said the word ""gay""? It may be-because of Anita Bryant. Andrew Young told me he would seen me the day before walking along Park Avenue. Then we left and went down to see Bryan Ferry at the Bottom Line. Then everyone went to Hurrah's for the party for Bryan Ferry that Jerry Hall was having. Ronnie was there with a date and Gigi was there with a date and that was a drama. Ronnie said later that Gigi threw a drink in his face and he swears he had not said or done anything to her but that then he retaliated by ripping the front of her dress."

Met Stuart Pivar there and saw a lot of paintings. A Liz was sitting there and there was a Pollock too. They told me this one painting was by the ""boyfriend of Seurat"" but I did not know Seurat had a boyfriend. The guys there all wanted my autograph so I did them. The new issue of the magazine arrived and Godunov looks good on the cover but he looks like a Christopher Street person I do not know if it will sell. Steve Rubell called Barbara Allen and John Bowes-Lyons and then said he was being moved to Atlanta. And Joe Dallesandro called Fred for money-I guess he wants to be supported for life-and I screamed at Fred I told him to tell Joe to ask Paul. Joe wants money just so that he can sit around I guess and drink a bottle of Jack Daniel's a day. And Vicky Leacock came by. she is Ricky Leacock's daughter. She said that her mother had just died-her mother was a model in the fifties-and that she was going up to Boston to stay with her father. She just came by because she was sort of upset. Her mother's kidneys were not functioning well and Vicky took her to New York Hospital and the people there were awful-they were arguing with each other and while they were bickering Vicky looked and saw that her mother's eyes were open and staring and she told the doctor and he said ""she is dozed off"" and Vicky tried to revive her and then they tried but they could not. Vicky just stayed at the office a few minutes and then she left."

And Stuart's girlfriend Barbara Guggenheim was out there in L.A. selling art to Stallone for hours and hours when PH was trying to wring just twenty more minutes out of him for her cover interview for our Movies issue. Oh aid I forgot to say that on 45th Street I ran into a lady who said her father delivered Ted Carey and his brother and she asked how he was and I did not have the heart to tell her he had AIDS.

So I copied down what she wrote and she sent it off to him. he is going home to Canada to die. Steve Rubell called to say that he had not seen me in a long time and that he was sending a car to pick me up and take me to the Go-Go's party at Private Eyes and it was just the party of the year kind of exciting. Paige took photos. And they gave you yellow stickers and that meant you could have free drinks. is not that funny?

Cabbed to La Petite Marmite which is on 49th in the Beekman Towers ($4). Truman said he is starting to be normal again and when I believed him he told me I was (laughs) ""too naive."" Truman was throwing his hands all over the place. I taped and we dished the whole lunch. He said that after lunch he was going to his analyst and I asked why someone like him would go to an analyst and he said because it was an old friend and he did not want to hurt his feelings by not going. Truman is so silly-looking open-toe shoes and no sweater and he said he just decided that he is going to start wearing anything. He said that Issey Miyake sent him a coat and he just threw it on immediately-he was written up in the papers when he wore it to Studio 54 with a white hat. We had lots of drinks and it was fun and then it got down to what Truman had invited me for. Bob MacBride who he always said was a writer but who we could never figure out what he did is now doing sculpture. he is left his wife and kids. We went back to Truman's place in you.N. Plaza. he is redecorated but the bulldog's torn off the buttons and the fringes from the furniture. And Bob MacBride brought out his-toys. His art. It was little cut-outs like you make in kindergarten. You know? Like circles and then you paste another circle over it and you make hexagons and things. that is what he does. And they wanted me to help him get a gallery. I said he would just missed Leo Castelli that he just went out of town but that when he got back we would make a lunch for Leo and him and Leo will think that is fun-lunch with Truman Capote. I told Truman I would tape him and we could write a Play-a-Day he could act out all the parts himself. (laughs) He could really do it-play his grandmother and everything. He gave me all the dirt we dished Lee and Jackie. Lee's got a new really rich boyfriend in San Francisco that is why she is spending time there. Truman said the Ladies' Home Journal offered him $10000 to review a movie but they would not tell him which one it would be and then he found out it was The Greek Tycoon so he turned it down. I think Truman likes me because I like everything he does not. he is so nuts you are embarrassed sitting there with him. And he is always talking about how he is getting a hundred thousand for this and a million for that but who knows. He was thrilled he said with his Tom Snyder show a couple of months ago thought it was really one of his best. I do not know why he does not go on The Gong Show. Home to glue. Then picked up Catherine and went to Doubles to get the bus to see Lucie Arnaz opening in Annie Get Your Gun out at the Westbury Music Fair. Barry Landau was in charge and I think he (laughs) invited all the people in his apartment building. I really think he did. People were going in for drinks and Gary Morton could not get in because he did not have a tie. The doorman was so dumb I told him ""do not you know that is Mr. Lucy?"" Lucille Ball looks so old but she has a beautiful body and she really was a beauty. On the ride out Bill Boggs did some announcing and then Gary Morton did some announcing like ""Here we go by a garbage can"" things like that and finally after an hour and a half we arrived. The place looked empty but then when they saw Lucy every old lady in pantsuits came swarming. God why do Americans dress so bad? Do they want to look unattractive so they will not get raped or what? When did it start? But Lucie Arnaz was good and I just love Harve Presnell he is the one I always really loved. he is 6'5"" and Tammy Grimes had an affair with him. The show was really long I do not know why. Oh a woman came up and asked for my autograph and she said ""I am Gloria DeHaven"" and I looked at her and it was. So I think maybe there were a lot of old stars that you just could not tell. A kid was throwing up and it was funny because we all just stood there and watched him."
"Thursday, June 30, 1977","[Barbara Allen, Bryan Ferry, Candy Bergen, Carrie Fisher, Dina Merrill, Earl McGrath, Fran Lebowitz, George Mason, Harrison Ford, Jann Wenner, Jerry Hall, MacKenzie Phillips, Marc Balet, Philip Niarchos, Robert Altman, Stan Rumbough]",0.06745324337121211,"George Mason called and invited me to dinner on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn. Stan Rumbough was going to the dinner too and that got me excited he is the young rich Post Toasties son of Dina Merrill. Dina is in A Wedding the Robert Altman movie that they are filming in Chicago. It just has a little bit of a storyline. Altman's doing all the things we tried to do in the late sixties and early seventies. George Mason picked me up. Stan Rumbough is very big about 6'3"" and he is handsome but he talks like a fairy. I have seen him a few times with cheap sort of Oriental-looking girls. he is got a high nelly voice but I guess he likes beautiful girls-he was disappointed that Candy Bergen cancelled out he said he would gone swimming with her when he was seven years old and wanted to see her again. It was an Armenian-Turkish-African-Arabian-type restaurant. Mashed chickpeas mashed eggplant three guys playing music. George had his model girlfriend Maret from Finland there. Barbara Allen was there. She still just really hates her Interview cover. The man with the new model agency came he brought about five girls and boys. Valentine was in heaven. The owners came over a lot and took pictures. A nun came over to me to autograph a bottle but my pen did not work. She said she would just gotten out of an operation and that seeing me was the most exciting moment of her life since she won $500 in the church lottery (laughs) I mean if these are high points for a nun ... Stan Rumbough seemed to like Barbara and was saying something that sounded like ""blow job"" a lot and blowing into a bottle. Philip Niarchos is probably not going to marry her so she should get him worried or something like that. She should live with him and get more things before he drops her. Stan says he is a ""photographer."" These rich kids it is so funny to hear them sit there and say ""I have a job oh yes doing pictures for a catalogue I work for a man who does catalogues and this is the second time I have been to Brooklyn-the first was yesterday I came here to pick up some wax fruit to shoot...."" I asked him if he wanted to do pictures for Interview. I mean Dina interviewed herself just to get Stan's picture of her published. And he said ""I am in a busy time now what with the catalogue work...."" Then on to Earl McGrath's party for the Star Wars people-Mark Hamill Harrison Ford Carrie Fisher and another girl but by the time I got to 57th and Seventh they were gone (cab $8). MacKenzie Phillips asked Vincent ""Got any blow?"" Jann Wenner was there and I introduced him to Stan Rumbough but Stan is so stupid-sounding and I forgot to clue Jann who he was so Jann probably thought he was just some kid who took pictures of waxed fruit because that is all he was talking about again. Good food. Fran Lebowitz and Marc Balet were there they may have come with Jerry Hall and Bryan Ferry. Jerry seemed to be back with him. Earl showed a videotape of the Sex Pistols. Barbara and Stan and I left together and when I left them they were still together."
"Thursday, June 30, 1983","[Bill Dugan, Bob Colacello, Elsa Peretti, Paige Powell, Robert Hayes]",0.1117225328683662,let us see I started off with I Love Lucy which was a good one-Lucy doing everything to Desi's scalp because he thinks he is going bald. Stopped at the new building and Robert Hayes really dresses up in a suit now a really good look the Bob Colacello look it looks nice. But I mean there he is with his dog at the office and dogs can carry diseases... And I think Oh what am I doing with my dogs letting them get so close to me after they have been out on the streets. Halston never let us Linda go to the street. She poops in the kitchen. The one time Halston let her go to the park she came back with those fleas that Archie got on the same day in the park (phone $.50 supplies $17.32). And when people on the street turn me down when I offer them a free Interview it just gets me right in the gut. Our TV show got a mention in Time in an article about Entertainment Tonight. Paige Powell had a big lunch for the Black Star & Frost jewelry guy to try to get ads. And Victor called and asked me if I stole his book on St. Sebastian. And I had to say yes. But how can a person who is so drugged-out know that I stole his book? Dropped Benjamin ($6). Then got another cab to the Olympic Tower to meet Halston to go out to see Liza perform in New Jersey ($3). Nancy and Bill Dugan were coming and Bill now wears his coat over his shoulders just like Halston. So we got there and it was a place with a top but no sides and it was freezing. Liza's show was just great two acts better than The Act. she is fabulous. She wore her YSL for the opening but with an Elsa Peretti belt and then after that the outfits were Halston. A hairdresser punked up her hair she is decided to be punk. I was starved had not eaten and there were no hot dogs or food being sold. And then Liza came in the car with us going back. And she said she did not like a dark limousine she had to have a light and so she turned on a light and it was on me and I could not stand it and so then I turned the light so it was on her and she liked that. She was in this spotlight all the way back.
"Thursday, June 4, 1981","[Bob Guccione, LeRoy Neiman, Philip Morris, Roy Cohn, Roy Neiman]",0.12965561224489797,I think I got a cold from drinking a really cold daiquiri. I can feel it it pierced me. I called California and was told he was too busy to talk. Got ready to go right in the neighborhood to the party at Bob Guccione's house for Roy Cohn. Roy was great I took pictures. I want to be friends with him but distant friends. And there was a Bunny-a Pet-there and I did not know what to say to her so I told her she had a great body. Then LeRoy Neiman came over and he was thrilled that we are going to have a (laughs) one-man show together and I just-I mean-well Philip Morris gave this guy some money to do a show of Neiman and me together. Anyway I will not go to it. I talked to LeRoy about why does Bob Guccione dress like such a fairy with all the jewelry. He had Rembrandts and Mr. Newhouse Clyde told me they were reproductions and he also had Chagalls and Picassos so I do not know if they were reproductions too. The house has a swimming pool. And what I forgot to say is the other night I had a blackout like I used to have when I was little. At first I thought it was because of flash bulbs but there were no flash bulbs really right there and it got me so scared that I am having a brain tumor or that I am getting the Dark Victory disease.
"Thursday, June 5, 1980","[Barbara Walters, Barry Diller, Cyndy Hall, Diane Von Furstenberg, George Hamilton, Hank Williams, Iris Love, Jerry Hall, John Travolta, Liz Smith, Lynn Wyatt, Princess Daisy]",0.09930395913154534,"-Houston We all went to the Cadillac Bar for lunch which has really good Mexican food. And I was sitting with this crowd from Dallas-Fort Worth. I met Travolta at lunch again. Got an autograph on a napkin. They all have these big Jerry Hall accents. And they all love Jerry because they can talk real Texas with her. We had frogs' legs and beef and chicken and shrimps everything barbecued and chilied and guacamoled. And it was so hot out it was like ninety-five degrees. And the air-conditioning broke down and the Texans say ""Turn up the AC! Maybe you need some freon Charlie."" And then we went to a few Western shops to get our costumes for the Urban Cowboy premiere. We finally got back to the hotel around 5:00. Everyone met in my room. Jerry was wearing a solid gold and rhinestone skintight cowboy suit with matching hat that George Hamilton gave her that he had worn in the Hank Williams movie and she said that Alana wanted it so badly and he never would give it to her and so not to tell Alana. Then we got into a limo and went to the Gay Lynn theater it was named after Lynn Wyatt. And there were thousands of paparazzi and fans because they would never had a world premiere in Houston before. And they were screaming ""Andy! Andy! Andy Warhol!"" And Jerry and I were posing for pictures. And then Jerry and Lynn Wyatt were standing in front of the theater with the TV crew and Lynn was becoming like Barbara Walters: ""And now we have the famous artist Andy Warhol and Jerry and Cyndy Hall who're stars in the movie and say Jerry where did you get that costume?"" Very professional she was wearing purple suede with her great figure. And we got in the theater and sat down and in front of us were Liz Smith and Iris Love in matching cowgirl outfits. And Liz's brother because Liz is from Texas. And Diane Von Furstenberg was walking up and down the aisles like she owned the place. She was wearing tight pants and a little top and a vest with a little sheriff's badge that said ""Disco Sucks."" And then she was wearing two tons of diamond and gold jewelry from the forties. And Barry Diller was sitting right behind us and then in walks John Travolta with a thousand people around him and he sat down right behind us and everyone was going crazy with the photographers and stuff and we were all jumping in with our cameras. And then the movie started and everyone loved it. Afterwards we took our limo to Gilley's where they shot the movie. We left one second early so we got there before the mob (tip $20 to the driver). There was a mob scene around where Barry Diller and I were sitting because John Travolta sat down two inches away. His eyes are just like-dyed-blue-green. I mean really deep blue. And he has the most beautiful smile. His teeth must be polished every day. And his skin is beautiful. And he is so nice. And he says nice things to everyone. And he was talking the most to this girl he thought was with us but she was a DVF groupie. And Diane is so desperate to be recognized that if one person says ""you are Diane Von Furstenberg I love you"" she says ""Come with me"" and she makes them follow her around for the rest of the night so that she can have a following and then she gives them presents-she carries lipsticks and compacts with her to give out and she autographs them. And well once Travolta was at our table it became really impossible because the crowd just pushed in on us and this policeman was standing right behind trying to protect us and he was drunk the policeman and I said ""do not look now Bob but you have a big gun and a big cock one inch from your neck."" And the policeman said ""Can I do anything for you?"" and Bob laughed and said ""Just stay right here."" And he did. And he had two guns in his holster very good-looking and he kept hugging us and bumping into us and rubbing his cock against us and saying ""Is there anything you need anything you want?"" But he was great because he kept screaming to the waitress and got all this food for us. The whole table. And all these drinks and beer. And he said ""you are not eating your pepper"" to Bob and Bob said ""Are you kidding? it is so hot I only took one bite"" and he said ""Well I will just show you how to eat a pepper"" and he took the whole big thing and slipped it in his mouth and ate it and then winked at Bob. I was the second biggest star after John Travolta. But a distant second. He got the most fans after him. They were screaming on the stage that everyone was going to have to leave if they did not let John Travolta have some room. Got home around 1:00. Started to read Princess Daisy it is an awful book but they mention me in it so it is something for the box. It said Daisy was too chic to go to an Andy Warhol party in London."
"Thursday, June 6, 1985","[Jean Michel Basquiat, Louise Nevelson]",0.21423611111111113,Went over to Macy's to judge the Madonna look-alike contest. They expected 200 girls but there were only 100. they would spent a fortune these girls on the clothes and jewelry. It was over pretty fast by 5:10 and it would started at 4:30. Went to Radio City Music Hall for Madonna's concert (cab $6). And the show was so great. Just so simple and sexy and Madonna is so pretty. Now she is thinner and just so great. And afterwards we went downstairs where there was a private party the level with the ladies' rooms. And Madonna came down with Jean Michel Basquiat-I guess he would gone backstage. And she was fun. She said she was going to the Palladium and might go to Keith's dinner and she was so sweet and nice. So we went and drove to Iso on 11th Street and Second and then Madonna did arrive she came in a truck. And they sat her next to me and she was just great. They were teasing her about her false eyelashes saying they were bigger than Louise Nevelson's. And everyone was so thrilled the waiters were on the floor. She was drawing cocks on Futura's pants.
"Thursday, June 7, 1979","[Giorgio Armani, Stanley Siegel, Steve Rubell]",0.10187461348175635,Truman called. He said he got a telegram from a fan congratulating him on The Stanley Siegel Show saying that it was the best thing on TV since Ruby shot Oswald. Steve Rubell said that his flower guy was at Lee's to deliver and she would not answer the door. At home I put on my new black linen Giorgio Armani jacket. it is the stiff fine linen like what used to be under crinolines. Anyway the big party Studio 54 gave for Interview last night got ruined for me because Jed had trouble at the door with Mark the doorman. And I mean it is confusing because Steve said he let Jed in but Jed says that Steve saw him and would not let him in.
"Thursday, June 7, 1984","[Diane Lane, Joan Rivers, Richard Gere, Robert Hayes]",0.14111111111111113,"Diane Lane was coming to the office to be interviewed and so I had to meet Gael Love (phone $.50 cab $5). I asked Gael about Robert Hayes and she said do not ask or she would start to cry. She said ""After you have worked with somebody for eight and a half years ..."" And then I did ask and a tear started forming. So I guess he has what everybody thought he had. She said his sister came to see her and said there is ""always a chance."" Diane Lane came and she is beautiful and sweet but she did not have much to say. She has a good philosophy about her movies though-she feels that if she did a good job then it was a good movie. She has to do some more shots with Richard Gere when he gets back from King David and she does not want to cut her hair again so she will have to do the big love scenes with a wig. And she said that whenever she did not feel ""in the mood"" Coppola gave her a fatherly talk and said ""There are no moods."" Gael was being too analytical so I asked Diane ""how is your sex life?"" And she laughed and said I was just like Joan Rivers. I said ""Did you ever sleep with Warren Beatty?"" And then she came out and said that she actually had gone out with him and that he would sat her on his knee and told her not to be afraid of sex gave her ""fatherly advice"" and everything. She said that she was chaperoned by her father. Yoko Ono's having a sale at Sotheby's but it is all junk-Art Deco jewelry she is had lying around and you know (laughs) toilet paper that John touched."

Liz and Halston were not there yet. I met the president of Cartier. Eugenia Sheppard was there. Hermione Gingold was there. A woman who did not even have to say she was Bob Feiden's mother came over to me and said that because she looked just like Bob Feiden but with jewelry. John Springer and Liz and Halston arrived. There were two or three Liz lookalikes there one introduced herself to Liz. I was next to Mary Beame the wife of Mayor Abe Beame. There were a few anti-defamation people on the dais and Hal Prince and Mike Todd Jr. Liv Ullmann led the prayer and Diane Von Furstenberg was there. Livia Weintraub who was good-looking gave a speech about being in a concentration camp and she ended it with a plug for her new perfume ""Livia."" She gave Liz one of the first batch of 50. Dore Schary was there he founded the league. It was rotten food- gold salmon. Then they gave Liz the plaque which had raw amethyst all over it-the stuff ashtrays are made of-it was of Mt. Sinai and at the top in gold was the Ten Commandments. Liz was in river purple she got up and gave a little speech very breathy and sincere like ""I am just like all of you-when I care about something I do something about it we are all like that thank you so much."" John Warner was there. Then she and Halston got up off the dais to make a trip to the bathroom and one of the ladies at Bob's table wondered ""Why are they both going to the bathroom?"" And another lady said ""Maybe she ripped her dress and Halston's going to sew it for her."" Cabbed downtown because we had to meet Bella Abzug at the office to photograph her for the cover of Rolling Stone ($4.25). Bella was there with her daughter (laughs) another dyke. Oh I am kidding but you know what I mean-a chip off the same block. I took pictures of Bella smelling a rose. Jann Wenner came down. Cabbed to La Petite Ferme a little restaurant in the Village where George Mason was having a dinner for me. Catherine and her brother Valentine were waiting for us out in the rain. All the boys in the family are raving beauties but the girls are like Catherine-just cute. Then I talked everybody into going up to Studio 54 for the party for Beatlemania. Aerosmith was there and Cyrinda Foxe from Bad who used to live with David Johansen but now she lives with one of Aerosmith. She said that a picture of me with a Campbell's Soup Can was in the light show of Beatlemania."
"Thursday, June 9, 1983","[Mickey Finn, Tom Selleck, Wayne Gretzky]",-0.0701984126984127,Got up early because I had a 10:00 appointment at the office that Fred had made with Wayne Gretzky of the Oilers (cab $6). When I got there they said that Gretzky had just called and said he was coming right down. Meanwhile Fred who had made this early early meeting was not there yet. By 12:30 I was still the only one there and I was mad. I found out from Brigid that the reason Fred was late was because he would brought home a black girl and she would Mickey Finn'd him and taken all his watches so I did not yell at him. And finally Gretzky arrived and he was adorable blond and twenty-two and cute. He does not wear shoulder pads when he plays. I told him he should go into the movies and he said that he was going to be in a Fall Guy and a Tom Selleck. He dates a Canadian singer. Brigid went up to Jennifer's graduation from Spence and I could not go I disappointed Jennifer because I had the Gretzky thing and then lolas to tape. But I called her and told her to bring her father down afterwards for lunch. Sent Brigid out for desserts ($20) and had champagne with Jennifer and her father. And then after they left that is when Benjamin told me that her father had been Edie's psychiatrist! Jennifer did not tell her father until a few days ago that she was working here. Jennifer stayed on and worked.
"Thursday, March 1, 1979","[Belle McIntyre, John Fairchild, John Head, Lorne Michaels, William Pitt]",0.12597402597402596,Walked to the office and I ran into John Head and Lorne Michaels coming in for the meeting that we were having with them to talk about a TV show. They said they would give me a show if we could give him the right look. I think they just wanted to come and get ideas though because when you do a TV show you do run out of them. But unless you are the producer of your own show you never make money so I think we should start at the bottom and do it ourselves and learn everything that way. Went home and changed and cabbed to the Plaza ($2) to meet John Fairchild Jr. and Belle McIntyre and William Pitt and Rupert (drinks $70). John had invited a bunch of fairies so that he would not have any competition for Belle. They have a strange relationship-I do not think he is going to bed with her but he somehow feels that he is and gets jealous. We walked to Regine's. It was so beautiful out. Belle started dancing with one of the twins and John got so jealous and he was going crazy and I just tried to hold him in my arms-he was so schizo-and then William Pitt said that the only way to stop it was to leave to go to Studio 54. So we did (cab $4).

The big drama was the Ronnie-Gigi-Spyro triangle. Ronnie called the Waldorf Towers late last night looking for Gigi and the desk would not put the call through to the Niarchos apartment so first he left a message saying that ""Gigi's husband called"" and later he left a message saying that ""Gigi's brother died."" So this morning Spyro called Ronnie and asked if it was all right if he came to Firyal's lunch he said he had not known that Gigi and Ronnie were ""together"" etc. Ronnie said he could come but that if Spyro said so much as hello to him he would beat him up. Spyro told Bob that Gigi had just walked up to him at the de Menil party and said ""Remember me?"" and he did not so she refreshed his memory and then said she was not with her boyfriend anymore and since they were both alone why did not they be together for the night. Spyro told Bob that now he thought Gigi was awful to involve him in her mess with Ronnie. So she blew it. Anyway at lunch everyone was sitting down and Ronnie came in and started filling his plate and then he said ""where is my seat?"" And I got scared there would be trouble because he was acting kind of hysterical so I told him that somebody had to answer the phones and anyway that if he sat down there would be thirteen at the table. Worked until about 4:00. Barbara looked very very thin she said that Peter Marino was doing a wonderful job designing her apartment. Cabbed up to pick up Victor to take him to Suzie Frankfurt's open house-""Suzie Frankfurt at Home"" (cab $5). Fred was there and so was Francesca Stanfill from Women's Wear Daily. Mayor Lindsay was there. Suzie had good tea sandwiches I ate around forty. Marvin Davis who was at I. Miller and gave me my first job was there and when he saw my old shoe drawings that Suzie has he said it was like being in the time machine. Suzie got nervous because nobody bought anything-clothes furniture antiques. The idea was ""Antiques in a Setting."" it is a cute idea. She can probably deduct three-quarters of the house. Dropped Suzie's ex-husband Steve Frankfurt off ($3). Went to the East Side antiques show ($2.50). Walked home. Bob and I picked up Elsa Martinelli at the St. Regis to take her to the Iranian embassy. It was a buffet jammed. In honor of the new American ambassador to Italy Mr. Gardner and his wife Danielle. I got stuck talking to the Baroness de Bodisco. Hoveyda tried to rescue me and said to her ""I think there is someone upstairs it would be nice if you came with me to meet"" and she said ""No."" And then Hoveyda said she would not be invited back again and she said ""I do not care."""
"Thursday, March 10, 1983",[Doc Cox],0.08748677248677249,At the office the phone rang and they told me it was Henry Post's friend Todd and I got goosebumps. Somehow I knew what it was. And he told me Henry had died-he got another cyst in his head from the virus that he got from his cat. I may have forgotten to tell the Diary that I called him last week in the hospital and I woke him up and I felt so bad. I asked him what I could get him and he said nothing that there was nothing he wanted. He told me he was really weak and had to get off and he said that he did not know if he was going to make it. And I begin to wonder if Doc Cox is any good. I do not even know if they really check my blood right. Maybe Henry would have been better off with one of those boy-disease specialists. And Lords of Discipline-Paramount's decided not to advertise it anymore because it will not take off. it is just doing okay $9 million. But then what I do not understand at all is why on Entertainment Tonight they put down the Paramount movie Lords of Discipline when they could just not mention it since Entertainment Tonight is Paramount's. I just wish I could understand the psychology but I am baffled. Why should they go on TV and say their own movie was slipping when they could just ignore it? I just wish I could get it.
"Thursday, March 12, 1981","[Bill Copley, Johnny Pigozzi, Walter Steding]",0.044612493987493985,-New York Vincent told me that Bill Copley's wife Marjorie the Czechoslovak madam from Pittsburgh-the one I just did the portrait of-walked out on Bill and went to Tiffany's and ran up a big bill cleaned out their bank account. Took the two portraits. She always takes a private plane from Miami to Key West and Bill was waiting at the airport for her with a bouquet of roses and instead of her coming off this guy came off with a divorce summons. Bill's body is now covered in third-degree burns. When they were down in Key West he was smoking in bed and she was asleep in another room and the two whores-friends of Marjorie's -that had flown down to Key West with her went out and when they came home at 5:00 they found the fire. He could have died. And she said she was asleep the whole time and did not hear anything or smell anything but the house was half burned down. The firemen had to come. Bill's been getting skin grafts and everything he is had a few operations. It was really terrible. And he is always alone because she fired the assistant and the secretary. Read my mail then went to the office (cab $5). Brigid was excited about getting an eye lift. She sent the money in already. And Ronnie was happy because he is got a rich girlfriend. Johnny Pigozzi came by and he had a new camera that went in a circle and took a whole panorama so I sent Ronnie out to get one just like it for me. And he was nice I think because he saw me painting and he always suspected someone else did it for me. Cabbed at 11:30 to the Ritz ($5.50). They gave us free drink tickets and Walter Steding went on right at 11:30 and was really good. it is so strange to see somebody who works for you as a janitor have that performing ability.
"Thursday, March 13, 1986",[],0.23333333333333334,It was raining hard. Paige and I went over to the Paris Theater and saw Room with a View. Nothing really happens an Out of Africa-type thing but it is beautiful. Good views of Florence.

And I called Cornelia to see if she wanted to go. The new issue of Interview came in the Health issue and it is thick and serious. It looks good. Told Cornelia 8:30 and she came in a limo ($25). And Dino's new restaurant this one that he is done with the guy from Club A it is in the Trump Plaza on 62nd Street and Third. And Geraldine Smith was there she was with some producer guy and she looks cute still. And Cornelia was working the room. Chris Walken was there and then Mickey Rourke arrived and he told me about the part in his Interview interview that PH cut out where he had a big fight with her. PH had already told me all about it but I played dumb. And Geraldine said she wished she had interviewed Mickey Rourke because she loves him and I reminded her of her interview with Harrison Ford when she was sitting on his lap for twenty minutes before she figured out he was the person she was supposed to interview. She was fun. And Mickey is just so adorable. Dumb but with some magic. And then these girls came in for him and they were all the same types about 5'4"" and pretty but nothing special. And he and Chris Walken kissed each other goodbye on the lips so tenderly it looked so gay. And Chris Walken was really drunk he said he was tired of his hair he would dyed it blond and now it needed retouching and Cornelia gave him the name of a hair place to go to."

The airplanes got lots of publicity. I called John Fairchild Jr. and invited him to Elephant Man and he said he would go and I said that he would probably cancel later and he said no if his life depended on it he would not do that. And then I got home and sure enough there was a long note cancelling saying that ""a friend came unexpectedly to town."" And I just do not know how to handle that. What should I do? Because I just knew he would do it. Should I tell him I never had tickets anyway that I just wanted to see what he would do? Should I tell him that? Or just say I did not care or maybe I should go to the other extreme and make him feel really really guilty because I just know he feels terrible about it. He probably did not sleep all night but I mean he knew he was not going to go and no friend came to town so why did he say yes in the first place? Elephant Man is Equus with an elephant instead of a horse but I could not stand Equus so how could I like this? But all the actors are good. After the play we went to Mortimer's to pick up Catherine. When we were leaving Sam Green insisted we come and see his new place before we went down to Studio 54 and so we went there and Sam's really got a great place. You open the door and there is these big stairs and I was kidding around telling Catherine right in front of Sam that he was a big cocaine dealer and he did not say anything so now I do not know if it is true. it is the new kind of place-empty with nothing in it but a rug and then that photo of him with Garbo at the King Tut thing. And Sam really does get around he traveled all over with John and Yoko talking to the Dalai Lama and things. Catherine broke her shoe she really is fat. Then as we were leaving across the street there was a party for China Syndrome going in and they yelled to Sam ""Can Andy Warhol come to the party?"" So we went over and we saw Jim Bridges and he is really the hottest new director now. He said that Jack was not there-Jack Larson our old friend Jimmy Olsen from Superman-that he was back in Hollywood.

And then there was a dinner at Shezan for Egon Von Furstenberg and Mrs. Egon and so I had to decide whether I felt well enough to goand I went-an hour late-and I was seated next to Mrs. Egon but the second I smelled the food I started to get violently I will and had to leave. But I kept it down. And then I got home and the dogs sat on top of me all night so I hoped they would pick it up and take it away from me. It was so weird to get sick like that. Vincent had caught the flu from his kids so I think I picked up this thing from him.

I have never heard that about Joan and it is hard to believe but I did not want to say that because she said ""I will show you the love letters you can see for yourself."" So I just-maybe she does not know the difference between lesbian and ... Oh I do not know. it is good gossip that is all."

I have got to write him a letter to tell him that because I just do not want to give the pictures to Jean. I mean there is probably not even anything really bad about me in the book but still I just do not want to. It was a sunny cold day. Cabbed to the Mayflower Hotel ($6) to interview Cher. She has a glamorous penthouse like a two-story house on top and she wanted to do it in the bedroom. Her bed overlooks Central Park. It was the fourth day she could not eat she could not even swallow a vitamin pill and she was taking medicine for her throat and it made her face break out and swell up and so she just drinks thick rich malteds so her weight does not go down too much. She was great she just said everything. She said she has two boyfriends now it just happened in one week and she is so happy because they are real men and I brought up Ron Duguay that we would heard she would been seeing him and she said yes but that he was too interested in himself he was not for her. She talked about anything except her father she said that was a ""No."" And Cher said that when they called and told her she had the second lead after Meryl Streep in the Karen Silkwood story she said she cried for five hours because everything she would done up to now has been shit except for the Come Back to the Five and Dime play and she is so happy. Dropped Bob ($3.50) then was picked up by Jon and went to Ahmet Ertegun's house. Bob said it was just for ""sandwiches"" but the stupid butler he should have taken us upstairs but he led us right in and everybody was sitting down at dinner and Mica and Ahmet had to get up. Then we went to the Bottom Line in a bus to see Ahmet's new act Laura Branigan who was absolutely great."

Mick Jagger arrived and that was the big moment everybody in the place got excited. And Charlie Watts was with him. No Jerry. They were on the loose. Julian Schnabel still wants to paint me and he says Saturday is the only day he can do it because he is going away. He gets $40000 for a portrait he is the Jim Dine of the eighties. He copies people's work and he is pushy and he is a friend of Ronnie's and he is married a rich girl already. I am going to have to sit for it. He does it abstract anyway but I guess I have to because he wants the inspiration. I ordered sweetbreads which I hate so that I would not eat anything. Then we went to John Samuels's birthday party at his father's big loft on Broadway. Jane Holzer was talking about Ian Schrager she is so hot for him she said he is the best sex and we sat there talking till 2:00 so I missed Jon's call from California.

Barbi was in town to do Joan's show the next day. But I knew Jed would be there so I said I could not. Joan was Jed's girlfriend in high school in Sacramento and Barbi was his brother Jay's. David Hockney came to lunch and Vincent did a video of him. And afterwards he went into the other room and did the interview. David's cute he really is magic. Julie Sylvester from the Dia Foundation who works for Heiner came by and she said that Philippa is now trying to help poor people she is giving them money and I hope that does not cut into what she does for art because she is really generous. Barbi Benton called and invited me to Pirates of Penzance and I told her I had other plans which I did but she said ""you are turning down a Playboy Bunny? Nobody's ever turned me down! you are the one who wears the pants-you can do anything you want to do. Just break your plans."" So I said okay that I would. I mean she was so aggressive-henpecking me-that I had to. I said I would pick her up at 7:30 at the St. Moritz and I asked if a taxi was okay and she said yes. Got a cab fast. I discovered that I did not have my small bills with me just a hundred so I had to borrow $20 from Barbi. She was seeing the play because she is determined to get the Linda Ronstadt part on the West Coast. She said that (laughs) Sonny Bono is going to play the Kevin Kline part. After the show Barbi said that Joe Papp had cleared it for her to see Linda Ronstadt so we went to see her and it was such a camp listening to these two talk. Linda wants to go into another play that is opening in the fall and Barbi told her ""This has led your career into new and wider scopes. Now you are competing with Barbra Streisand."" And they talked about how painfully shy each of them was. Rex Smith was there in his tight pants with his big cock and he looked at Barbi and said ""This is my new adventure"" because when we did the interview with him he would said that he was looking for a ""new adventure."" I invited Rex to dinner with us at Pearl's and he glued and rolled up a joint and turned down some phone calls and some other dates. Barbi looked so good too she looks really good. So we went over to Pearl's and did not get there till 11:00 they would already closed the kitchen but they waited for us anyway. Rex was heavily going after Barbi and I asked him about his ex-marriage and he said it was to an older woman that he liked older women and he asked Barbi how old she was and she said thirty-one and it was going happily until it came to ""Are you married?"" and she said yes and then Rex was a deflated balloon and the dinner was sort of over. I left Rex walking on the street sort of turning around but then-I do not know-maybe they had made a date because he was walking toward the St. Moritz but I do not know. Barbi had to get up at like 5:30 to be on Joan Lunden's Good Morning America show."

Had a day off from The Love Boat. The couple from A&M records the Mosses came for a portrait and the wife was puffy around the eyes and we had to wait for her eyes to go down. Went over to Tony and Berry Perkins's in one of the canyons. They have a big house six bedrooms. there is really a lot of traffic. Where Jon's house is there is absolutely no traffic. And Tony cooked the dinner and listen to what it was-meatloaf and polenta and bread pudding. it is been so long since I have eaten like that. Not since the fifties when people were poor. He uses this new cookbook that has a lot of recipes from the forties and fifties like Rice Krispies Squares. it is called something like short-cut cooking. Wendy Stark was there and she was not so cheerful maybe it was just because she was not drinking. Sue Mengers was fun blabbing away and her husband was with her. They have Indian rugs. And Tony asked after Chris Makos. Berry was kissy and huggy. Nick and Lisa Love were there. We stayed until about 11:00 and then went back to the hotel.

Benjamin came in drag to pick me up for the shooting. He was going to be in it too. I had to be a bartender and wear a tux. The crowd of extras looked like the old Factory days-Benjamin in drag and a bald-headed mime in a Pierrot outfit and John Sex with his snake. And then there was Dianne Brill with her big tits and hourglass figure. The Cars were cute. They finally got to my part at 8.00 and I had to sing a song but I could not remember the words. And I had to mix a drink while I was doing it and with my contacts on I could not see the Coke button on the soda dispenser. And that meant being face to face with the Cars for a while and it was hard to talk to them I did not know what to say. I finished at 9:15. One of the kids gave me a ride home."

I tried to discourage him saying that it was really too small. It was. I can not figure out why Maxime wants to go there it is no bigger than her apartment. She says ""I just want one big room"" but when she moves all her furniture in it will not even look or feel big at all. And it costs $32000. Victor and his boyfriend walked me back to the office. A fortune teller told Victor's boyfriend that he would be hit by a cab. Then she said maybe that was not right that she would better read the tarot cards too so she did and then she said ""it is going to happen even quicker than I thought."" So now the kid is really worried. She charged him $5 and first he said ""I am not going to pay you for telling me that"" and she said he had to so he did. How could a person do that! I mean that is the kind of thing that really really really stays in your mind. The reason the kid went there in the first place was because his friends had told him she was so good. To make him feel better all I could think to say was that maybe she could see he was a careless person and had told him that to make him more careful. I was invited to Diane Von Furstenberg's dinner for Sue Mengers. Went home glued myself together cab to DVF's ($2.25). It was a very heavy newspaper-reporter dinner. Mr. Grunwald from Time magazine Nora Ephron-did not see her husband Carl Bernstein though-Helen Gurley Brown and her husband David Irene Selznick and DVF's boyfriend Barry Diller. I was feeling very talkative so I talked and I talked but nobody listened to anything I said they just ignored me. I know that Diller does not like me so I worked hard to change his mind but he was still awful to me. Bianca was there. I thought she would already left for Paris. She was saying out loud everything I was thinking-what two bitches Diane Von Furstenberg and Sue Mengers were-and she said ""At least Sue can be funny sometimes."" Sue was on her way to Europe to meet her husband who only let us her see him once every couple of months I think. I told Irene Selznick that I would seen a great picture of her at George Cukor's. I was raving about California so much that everybody thinks I am moving there. Helen Gurley Brown sat at my feet and I talked to her about California. Bianca was talking about how boring all these people were to Mr. Grunwald she did not know who he was and then after he went away I told her. They were all two-faced people there and Diane only invited me to pay me back for the Interview cover and I mean who cared. Diane is very skinny. Dino De Laurentiis came late with his wife Silvana Mangano she was wearing a white Oscar de la Renta and said she was cold. Egon Von Furstenberg came in with his girlfriend the one that used to come to the Factory who I can not stand and I guess she finally realizes that I hate her because she did not say anything to me. Her name starts with M something like Marita. he will never marry her. Bianca said she wanted to go dancing and called her answering service but there was nothing on it so she stayed. She was wearing a thrift-store dress that she got in California that was really beautiful. When the De Laurentiises walked by us to leave she said ""they are full of shit."" I left alone. Had a horrible time."

He knows everything like that at British Airways on Tuesdays and Thursdays on Park Avenue you just sign in and there is free shrimp buffets. Amina the black model who is writing a play kept saying ""Where is that Richard Gere? he is supposed to be here!"" But then when he came he did not pay attention to her so she did not like him anymore and she came over to where I was signing Kennedy posters. Robyn brought the lunch from 65 Irving but then Brigid ate every bit that was left so he did not have any. Then it was a beautiful day so I said why did not Brigid and Chrissy and I go over to University Place to see if Bea was in her antiques shop. We passed out Interviews to the junkies who have moved from Park and 17th to the corner of 14th. Then we were all in Bea's and Brigid said she would be right back that she was going across the street to get a pack of cigarettes. And a second after she left I heard a big noise and a thud and I just knew. I ran out and there was Brigid lying in the street with a truck one inch away from her fat belly. Then she got up and she was laughing and she said ""No no I am all right."" It was a truck from an art restorer. The kid was sweet he wanted to take her to the hospital but she was so relieved she was all right that she said no. She was just scared out of her wits. Chrissy was so nervous she had to go home. I was so happy Brigid was alive that I told her she could have anything in the world so she had ice cream cones ($.75 x 4 and $.90 cookies from Greenberg's and then cake $12 Big Macs $8.52). We walked around for an hour to make sure she was okay. All we could think about was here today/gone tomorrow. I hope it taught her a lesson to be more careful. Then we went back to the office. I told her she could have the rest of the day off but it turned out they needed her. She went to an A.A. meeting and then came back. Fred was really drunk at the office he would been to the Cecil Beaton memorial thing. He was talking like Diana Vreeland and making business calls so I just hope he called the right people."

So she called Brigid and Brigid had Robyn Geddes say she was not there and then Dennis Hopper called a few minutes later and Brigid took that call and they were talking and Brigid was putting down Jean Stein saying she was pestering her and it turns out that Dennis is staying with Jean. Then later on Viva called from California and started trouble-she told Brigid that if Brigid did not cooperate with Jean that Jean would put everything horrible about her in the book and that Brigid could not sue because it was all true. And Dennis probably hates us too because I did not go to his cocktail party. I did not go because I forgot but I knew I was never going to go and that is why I did not remember. But Dennis is wanting me to go to Mexico to meet some friends of his and Dennis and his group always did know all the rich people but they are so sixties and they are crazy. I tried to work on the text for the photo book with Brigid and Bob but every time I made a suggestion Bob would scream at me at the top of his voice that it was great the way it was and then Brigid would scream it was great too. Bob raises his voice so much I really do think he is nuts. So I do not know what they want me to even read it for anyway since they feel they are doing such a wonderful job and that it is all so great great great great. So I left them alone with their greatness. Actually it is stinko. I do like the title though-we are calling it Social Disease- and the photographs do look really good.

I should tell Harcourt Brace to just go fuck themselves. What are they doing over there? When is the ad going to run in the Times! In the morning I picked up Bianca and Victor and went to the Olympic Tower because I had an appointment with Halston to see his sportswear line ($4.50). Bianca had a great Halston top on and a blue bottom and her ass really was wide. She had on Manolo shoes and an Elsa Peretti belt. We got there just in time. Halston keeps using his aging models because he feels they were loyal to him so now he will be loyal to them. Cabbed to 860 ($5.50). Catherine was having a lunch for Alexander Cockburn and the P.J. O'Rourke guy from the National Lampoon. A writer-photographer from Stern wanted to be photographed with me for the preface for his book and Henry Wolf an old friend of mine was there to take a picture. He was the art director of Harper's Bazaar in 1960 and he changed the look of the magazine. It was either him or Marvin Israel I can not figure out which who first used ugly girls with big noses and things. And I guess Mrs. Vreeland probably encouraged it because actually it was now that I think about it just like putting herself on the cover. Then the limo came at 2:30 to take us to Princeton for a book signing that Wilson Kidde set up for us. Ian Maxtone Graham from Brown came with us. They had a place set up to sign outside. It was not a rich bookstore like the Harvard Coop. This was more just like a little bookstore in a building so it was better being outside because the kids going by would see a crowd and go up to see. Then we had a tour of the campus. Really rich-looking. A naked rugby team ran by doing their numbers just wearing jockstraps some kind of initiation or something. Then Wilson took us to an all-male club for dinner the Ivy Club and just a few girls came by for drinks. Champagne punch. All these rich kids. The grandson of Seabrook frozen vegetables. The son of J.D. Salinger Matt. He was really good-looking. he is trying to be a photographer and he writes. A cousin of Frolic Weymouth's from Chadds Ford was there. And a kid who did not belong to the club Ritt who was a model for Elite but he did not look like one-he had a big nose and beautiful eyes but he was short. I bought books. One was the Liddy book ($20.92). Dinner at this all-male club was leftovers. Like spaghetti al dente cheese on top. Baked alaska with Haagen-Dazs that was 2' X l' that Ritt made. Four bottles of wine. Went back at 9:00 the drive was nice.

But I can just take someone else with me I do not know what he is so worried about I do not have to go with him. it is the huge birthday party Johannes's wife Gloria is giving for him-it is days and days of events. And Sam was in a foul mood so we had a fight I asked him to get me some potato chips and he turned me down. He was just moping. And Vincent asked him to do something and he did not.

Brigid says she watches him when he is at the office spraying chloro-something on his shirt and then sucking on it. The stuff they use to freeze when they operate. Catherine and I were going up at 3:15 to Martin Scorsese's at the Sherry Netherland to interview him and Robbie Robertson from The Last Waltz. And Catherine was so in love with Robbie Robertson and Martin Scorsese that she had Gigi come by and do her makeup-lipstick and blush-on and eye makeup-but actually she looks better without makeup. We were late so I gave Ronnie money ($5) because he had to get a Checker cab he was bringing a big painting uptown and Catherine and I went alone (cab $3.50). Marty had a big suite and he is so adorable. The lady publicist who is doing The Last Waltz was there. Robbie Robertson did not get there until 5:00. A kid named Steven Prince was there he played a creep selling guns in Taxi Driver and he is really like that so he was real. Marty said that now he is doing a full-length movie on Steven Prince's face where he tells stories he said he got that idea from me. Marty said he and Robbie were looking for a house so I told them places to go. So that is his roommate and he is got a butler too and it seems like he is starting his own Factory. He must be really in the dough because they are going to spend about $500000 for it. Marty was shaking like crazy. I guess from coke. We sat down and had lunch and it was funny because the publicity lady had just come back from lunch so she sat at the other end of the table watching so it was like a movie. I could not even look at her though I was so starving that I ate. I had not eaten lunch at the office because I was trying to diet. We gossiped a lot I do not know how much of it we will be able to print. Robbie said he knew me from the Dylan days. I asked him what ever happened to the Elvis painting that I gave Dylan because every time I run into Dylan's manager Albert Grossman he says he has it and Robbie said that at some point Dylan traded it to Grossman for a couch! (laughs) He felt he needed a little sofa and he gave him the Elvis for it. It must have been in his drug days. So that was an expensive couch. Bob called and said we had to go to Liz Smith's book party at Doubleday's so we left and went over there. We rode up with Geraldine Fitzgerald who was really sweet she looked like a nice witch. Her hair. And I said hello to Iris Love. Then I dropped Catherine ($2.50) and went home and glued. Jed was going with me to the premiere of The Greek Tycoon. He was a little late and we did not get there until 7:45 (cab $2.00). It was so incredible to see a movie where they cast people to look just like the people who they are not supposed to be. Anthony Quinn really looks like Onassis. When we got to 54 Stevie said he would just driven Bianca to the airport. He said he is so in love with her and that if he were not gay he would really fall for her but he just could not get it up. But (laughs) I think he was glad she was gone. I think Halston's glad too. it is so much. Stevie said they went walking in Central Park at 8:00 in the morning like kids.

He said that in Key West he was smoking and set himself on fire and he went to the hospital and they treated him and released him and then the wife served him with papers. But he is still crazy about her-he is decided to buy the two surplus portraits of her that I did I do not know what he will do with them. Remember this is the wife who was the ex-madam.

And now he is buying the apartment in Long Island City that my brother's giving him money for. he is got a Salvador Dali mustache James does and his girlfriend was bubbly. And Brigid was loving it all. Plus I would just gotten a letter from my sister-in-law. She said that George is getting a divorce and the wife is trying to take away the business that my brother gave him. They have two kids. it is a junk business. You know what I mean-like they get scrap and electronics machinery and melt it down and they get a lot of gold out of it-you melt it down with blowtorches in acid and then the gold floats. They live in Pittsburgh. And they are buying up the black neighborhoods on the North Side. And my brother speaks better than I do he always was a good talker. he is a big gambler too. And he is retiring and bought a farm up in Erie. Ran into Bill Cunningham on his bike I just wish I could do what he does just go everywhere and take pictures all day. And he used to be a hat designer but he went into photography when hats went out in like '64. I met him around Serendipity. When hats went out his whole life disappeared. And now he takes these photographs all day I see him even in odd locations like on 43rd and Lexington shooting people coming out of Grand Central. he is so meek and skinny and he rides his bike and you never see him eat or drink at these parties. Cabbed to meet Lidija at 860 ($5). The place was emptying out. They were moving stuff up to 33rd Street all day. Worked all afternoon. Rupert came up and now he is meeker. Went to meet Jon at East-West for dinner (cab $10).
"Thursday, May 18, 1978","[Barry Diller, Billy Kluver, Diane Von Furstenberg, Peppo Vanini, Peter Brant, Sue Mengers]",0.0359375,Cab to Chemical Bank ($4). Walked to the office and there was a big lunch for Peppo Vanini and his Xenon discotheque electricians and Billy Kluver the head of-what is it called? Experiments in Art and Technology-E.A.T. I am surprised that the Star Wars movie company did not actually franchise discotheques of Star Wars all over the country but then now that I am thinking about it things like that never work. it is usually one person who stands around screaming that makes a success out of a club. I worked all afternoon on some pictures. Everyone was talking all afternoon about the big auction coming that night with the paintings of mine in it that Peter Brant put up for sale. And Bob was upset that he was not invited to Diane Von Furstenberg's party that she was having for either Sue Mengers or Barry Diller. Fred was not invited either so I was going to have to go alone. I glued myself for Diane's (cab $3). Bob had gone to the auction and he called me at Diane's to say that a big Disaster went for $100000 but a medium-sized Mao only went for $5000. That sounded okay so I told him we could still kick up our heels I was relieved that the paintings sold okay. I guess people do not want to buy at auction now because you can not make a big profit. Diane always has the same food. it is like revisited. The same Chinese guy makes the same egg rolls and the same chocolate cake and the same everything.

And Bianca was driving me crazy saying how she is researching my days in Pittsburgh for her book on Great Men and she went on and on about how I broke the system broke the system broke the system and I felt like saying ""Look Bianca I am just here. I am just a working person. How did I break the system?"" God she is dumb."

Brigid and I went over to the beauty parlor on Third Avenue and I got a pedicure and manicure. People going by looked in the window and saw me and could not believe it ($26). Two girls from Visual Arts saw me and came in and then ran back to school to get their art portfolios out of their lockers to show me. Brigid ran into Gerard Malanga on the street on her way out and brought him in and he had his camera with him but the wrong lens so he was going crazy because he could not take a picture of me getting a pedicure. Then the Visual Arts girls came back and I introduced them to Gerard and it was like old times seeing him go after beautiful young girls. And while I was there two men came in and made appointments I guess because they saw me in there. One was a fashion victim. The manicurist said there would be a three-day wait and he said ""Well put me down."" I have gained weight. I do not know what to do my shirts are getting too tight for me."
"Thursday, May 21, 1981",[Jon Gould],0.16818181818181818,There was a message for me when I got home that Jon Gould had called and said he was getting the red-eye and would be in New York at 7 A.M. and waiting at 8:00 for Christopher to pick him up to go to Cape Cod. I had so much to pack-costumes film cameras radios TV-that I did not get it all done.

He brought me a T-shirt. I was reworking Lynn Wyatt's portrait. Sent flowers to Sharon Hammond and Cornelia Sharpe. Gael Malkenson said she is getting married this Saturday. In a Catholic church. But she always says things that I do not know if they are true. Worked till 7:00. A kooky girl followed me to Park Avenue when I left she was like one of those kooky girls you meet when you first come to New York. Dropped Rupert ($4) and got home around 8:00. I looked through my things for something for Marisol for her birthday and finally decided to give her a little painting but when I went to pick Victor up he wanted it so I gave it to him. We went down to Chanterelle in Soho that restaurant that everybody raves about and says how small it is and how hard to get into. Well it was not so small it looked big really. And the food was just okay it was not so hot. Marisol kept saying this was the first party she ever gave and Halston assured her it was really great. The first person I talked to was Ruth Kligman and she is now a born-again Christian. And she was different. Very nice and calm but then I began telling her about Gerry Ayres's movie The Painter that he was writing for Jack Nicholson and then she was more like her old nervous self. She said ""Should-do you think I should call Jack?"" and ""Do you think my lawyer should call Gerry Ayres?"" and I said ""it is only a fiction thing he is writing! Relax. After he does that artists' stories will be more popular and you can really sell your book Love Affair for a movie."" Ruth said maybe she could get Nick Nolte to play Jackson Pollock. And she explained that when you are born-again you just get a clean slate wipeout that nothing you did before counts. So it is just like confession that is all it is except you can go to confession every day and I guess you can only be born again once. John Cage was there and Merce Cunningham and Louise Nevelson who came at the end of the dinner but had a special place saved for her. George Segal and his wife. Joe Brainard. It was nice to see him again after all these years but I did not get to talk to him much really. Marisol looks good for fifty. She made the birthday cake in the afternoon and it was really just beautiful-beautiful marzipan figures beautiful beautiful figures fucking and she gave me one and Halston one and they were like little jewels. We told Marisol she should not tell her age because people would never know and she said she thought they already knew because it is always in all the catalogues and I told her people do not read the catalogues and she said (laughs) well that then only the forty people or so that were there at dinner would know."

There was a camera crew waiting at the office some English thing that d'Offay set up I do not know what it was. I mumbled. Left early. Was picked up at 8:00 by Sam (cab $8). Got to the Beacon for the stage show Yoko was doing and she was on already. Met Stephen Sprouse there. She was doing the happy years from 1980-81 in men's clothes and Reeboks and I do not know why she is doing this. She looks great but this is so stupid she should be up there in furs and Armanis and looking really rich. And she should let John rest in peace. All I can think of is that Sean must really want his mother to stop this. He must be embarrassed. Then went down to Grace Jones's birthday party at Stringfellow's it was like a trip back into the seventies neon dance floor and Bunnies with asses. And there was no dinner so we left there we just wanted something to eat we were all hungry so we went over to the Caffe Roma for just something quick and quiet and we walked into this big scene it was a dinner for Prince Albert and Bob Colacello was there and Cecilia Peck and Cornelia Guest. A hundred people to say hello to. Took the cheese off and ate the pizza.

I still keep wanting to think it was a put-on like his weddings. They said he was thirty-eight so I must have met him when he was what? Eighteen? Here from Dusseldorf the partner of Hans Mayer came to lunch at the office. And Fred and I had words because he was being so elegant and grand and said to me in right front of Hete ""Why do not you tell Hete how you really feel about the gallery not paying you."" You know so I was stuck. Fred really is bored. He wants to do a change I guess. Like Paul Morrissey did. And then Paige picked me up but she was only in a taxi not a car. And I said I would said to get ""a car"" and she said ""Well this is a car"" (cab $9). Then got to the Apollo and there were millions of cops. It was the Hall and Oates taping and it was benefit for the Negro College Fund. Hall and Oates came on and they were great did all their hits. Boy George arrived with Cornelia and they were in a box and he was throwing kisses. And then two of the Temptations came on and jammed with them and they were great and you could really see that that is who Hall and Oates copied. And when it was over we left and the cops were just crazy for Boy George. I have never seen anything like it. They just all wanted his autograph so much and Marilyn said to one of them ""I want to have an affair with you"" and he said ""I have someone you will really like."" I mean I really have never seen that kind of thing going on with the cops."

I opened a Time Capsule and every time I do it is a mistake because I drag it back and start looking through it. Like I found some film fragments in one and then you just wonder where the rest of the film is. The Whitney now has my old movies. I finally gave them to them-Vincent did. But they can not do anything with them without my permission. they are just looking through them now and cleaning them. Jean Michel Basquiat came by and he was in a pretty good mood. We had Chinese take-out food. He was painting some big black screaming people. Worked till 7:00. Jill Fuller picked me up outside in a limo and we went to see the Pink Floyd guy perform at the Beacon Theater. And then afterwards there was a dinner that Lorne Michaels was giving at Cafe Luxembourg so we went over there. Henry Geldzahler and Clemente were there and I felt bad because Jean Michel Basquiat and I are doing the combined canvases now without him and they are coming out so good whereas the ones we were doing with him Bruno gave us so little for. But maybe we will give Clemente some of our rejects and see if he can do anything with them. he is really sweet. And Steve Martin came! That was exciting. he is so good-looking. I thought that he was going with Bernadette Peters but he was with this new girl and I did not know who she was. He has such a good body and he is really attractive. Someone started to introduce us and he said no that we would met already that they did not have to. He told me he would had a Marlon Brando of mine for two days but then had to return it because it did not go with his place it did not fit. The Jane Bonham Carter girl was there and she happened to call the girl with him ""Vicky"" and then it clicked who she was! It was Vicky Vanini who used to be married to Peppo Vanini and now she is the actress Victoria Tennant! And here I would been looking at her across the table and not recognizing her for an hour. No wonder people think I am on drugs. So then we began to blab and that was fun."

Went to the Kunst Museum for a press conference (cab $4). I did not have to talk they were just taking photos. It was hard to look at a retrospective I just pretended to look at the walls. I can not face my old work. It was old. Had to sign a lot of Soup Cans portfolios stuff like that. That lasted about two hours. Peter Brant never sent his pictures.

Clara looked good thinner and Paloma too. Clara's suffering through the marriage of her boyfriend Thadee Klossowski to Loulou de la Falaise. She first found out by an official notice in Le Figaro placed by Thadee and Loulou. she is getting her sense of humor back now so she is getting over it. I said Clara and I should announce our marriage in Le Figaro to outdo them. Cabbed to train station ($8). Had our own compartment. Fell asleep. Arrived Brussels at 7:00. Mr. LeBruin the art dealer showing my pictures greeted us with a couple of hippie boys. Checked into the not-chic Hotel Brussels. We all had duplex suites which was crazy because whenever the doorbell rang you would be upstairs in the bathroom and you would have to rush down the floating staircase to answer it. Rushed to Galerie D. A mob scene. Stuck in a corner signing autographs and books. Sold 120. The kids here were cute sort of hippie. Around 9:00 made a fast chic exit through mob into our chauffeured Chevy and expected to be whisked away but then we saw that there was nobody in the driver's seat. A kid offered me an ice cream cone and I said no so he splattered it all over the roof of the car and it dripped down the windows. The kids started laughing at us just sitting there for twenty minutes. Finally the chauffeur arrived and said he would been peeing. Stopped at Leon Lambert's. He lives in the penthouse of a ten-story building above his bank. The place is unbelievable so simple and so much art from Van Gogh to Picasso to-Warhol. Saw his bedroom behind a bookcase in the library. Secret apartment with two bedrooms one for his regular boyfriend one for one-night stands. After dinner in a little bistro in the Galleria we walked down the arcade. Stopped at a gay bar and Bob asked the most beautiful boy in Belgium to dance so they did but when Bob gave him a peck on the neck and that led to the lips Fred and I got embarrassed because everyone said boys do not do that in public in Brussels-even in gay bars!

At 2:30 was picked up by Fred and Kate Harrington because we had to go to Boston. Cabbed to the airport. New York Air. I was reading this Peggy Guggenheim book and the best part in it was when Iris Love finds out (laughs) she is Jewish-they take her aside and tell her in school. Ted Turner's on Donahue right now. he is so smug. I hate him. Ever since he would not say hello to me once at the White House. When we got to Boston Mary Richardson picked us up and took us to a Hilton Hotel. And Joe Kennedy came out and gave a speech and he is not a good speaker. He said ""That great American artist who brought art down""-and Fred almost fainted-""to the American people."" Well I guess Pop Art did but he really is a bad speaker. He sounded so false no heart to it."

Everybody at Interview was thrilled that Robert's gotten better. I am going over to see him. Gael said he is happier and brighter and younger-looking than ever. Jean Michel Basquiat called and wanted us to come down to the Mary Boone Gallery to look at his show so I said we would. So I took Jay and Benjamin and it looked great (cab $5). Jean Michel Basquiat was very nervous. He was with a pretty Korean girl who is the secretary of Larry Gagosian his gallery person in L.A. But he will just break her heart. All these pretty girls go for him. They were lovey-dovey holding hands. Then Jean Michel Basquiat wanted to go to dinner so we decided to go down to Odeon because that way we would be close to the Area party for Vincent Spano that Vic Ramos was having (cab $6). And Robert Mapplethorpe was there and something's wrong with the way he looks now. he is either lost his looks or he is sick (dinner $280). Area was close by but we took cabs because it was raining (cab $3). And the only big draw was that Matt Dillon and Vincent Spano were going to be there and Benjamin went up to Matt and said ""Andy's looking for you"" but he said ""Andy who?"" And then later I did talk to him and he was just mumbling and looking for girls. He really has to get a good movie soon he needs one badly."

I guess about 20' X 20' but it costs $1400 a week. You can get a room at the Barbizon though for $84 a night. Victor's almost an artist I do not know why he does not become one. He saved every photo of every window display for Halston that he ever did. I was in pain from the shiatsu treatment. Vincent was working on the contracts we are selling a painting to try to get money to pay all these new kinds of bills we have with the new building. I am so sick and tired of it all. Went up to Dr. Linda Li's and she did her stuff and the pain was still there but this morning it is all gone. She saw some tea in my bag and said it was no good and she rejected me. She raises your hand and puts the vitamins on you and she says that from how hard your hand comes down she knows if the vitamins are any good or what you need. Stayed there till 8:00. Oh and did I say that I got this really serious letter from George Plimpton? I could not believe it. Because I would given little Charles Evans an interview for his high school paper and in it I said something about how George told me he did not have anything to do with all the bad things that were said about me in the Edie book. So (laughs) he writes me this totally serious letter about how it had been out of his hands and nothing to do with him. Oh and I noticed this ""quote"" from me in Edie where they have me saying ""perhaps"" and it looks so funny. I do not say ""perhaps""-George Plimpton says ""perhaps."" I mean if they are going to fake quotes from me they should know I would say ""maybe."""

They just put me in front of the Myths and I almost threw up they looked so sixties. I am not kidding they really did. Glued myself together and picked up Jon Gould and we went to the theater to see Little Foxes and there was the biggest crowd. We had first-row seats in front of Halston and Liza and Mark. Liz Taylor's mother was there she was cute like Janet Gaynor. Lots and lots of curtain calls they would have gone on forever. They dragged Lillian Hellman onstage. Then we went backstage. Senator Warner said hi to me. I told the colored maid how great she was and so was Dennis Christopher. Jon and I left and went to the birthday party that Lady McCrady was giving for him at 15 or 17 Park Avenue which is actually the backyard of where I used to live in Murray Hill. And I was talking to this blonde girl for a while and this guy said ""I bet you do not know who you were talking to"" and I said no that I did not and he said ""that is Rita Jenrette the congressman's wife who posed for Playboy."" She said she lives smack in Harlem-I guess either she has no money or a black boyfriend. she is really kooky and really bright. Jon dropped me home and he came in for five minutes and then he left."

Before they would been saying that he was just upset and having a nervous breakdown because his boyfriend died of it. Went to the Palladium for the late version of the Andre Walker fashion show. And as we were standing looking over the balcony my crystal fell out of my stomach onto the dance floor and I had to go down and find it. Wilfredo actually found it. Tony Shafrazi was next to me when it fell. It could have killed somebody. I wear it over my stomach between the surgical corsets and it just fell out.

And then Steve's driver took us over to the Palladium and it is what the movies in the thirties were all about-dirty on the outside and then inside these white pristine columns and everything big and lacquered blue poles and stairs like Ziegfeld Follies girls would come down. And Clemente's painting a ceiling. But I mean still it is just another place to go and Area is already so successful at this and they change themes all the time so I do not know. He and Ian are just ""managing"" the club because you can not have a police record and own a club. Like we had to be fingerprinted and checked out when we had our club The Dom in '65.

At dinner I sat with a German girl who'd accosted me on the street earlier for an autograph so that was funny. We got there a little late and we missed the speech.

And the dresses were all just linen and the sleeves were like folded napkins a 1914-style look. Funny sleeves. I do not know why she would want to go into the dress business-it is not like she has a ""statement"" to make. Bianca was there and Steve Rubell told me that the reason she did not want anyone at the birthday party she gave for Jade was because Jade's gotten chubby. So I slipped out (cab $4). Then Cornelia and I walked over to the Pierre for the ASPCA benefit thing. I talked to C.Z.

I got flustered and then told the kid that he was so good-looking why was he a cab driver. He said ""Well the closest I ever came to acting was I bought Joe Dallesandro's dog."" He meant Caesar Joe's big dog that was in Trash that Paul brought back from Hollywood out of Jack La Lanne's dog's litter. What he actually said was ""My girl and I bought his dog."" The kid had a high voice so I had high hopes he was a fairy until he said that. He said that he is still with the girl and they still have the dog. I was embarrassed about Iran so I gave him $5. Cabbed to the bank ($3) then walked to the office. Then Rupert came by and he would had a facial all morning from the famous health lady-he is more interested in having his hair dyed and facials than in working. And if you are going to go for facials you have to go every day and anyway you might as well do it yourself all a ""facial"" means is that you take more than five minutes to wash your face. Jay and Tom stopped by for a while they were mourning Michelle Long their drag queen friend who just died. Went to Regine's dinner for Ira Von Furstenberg (cab $2). Regine never showed up.

Francois Catroux was there with his wife Betty and they were sitting with Ahmet Ertegun. And in a case like that who do you say hello to first-you go to the table and who do you kiss first? I know Ahmet was offended. Princess Ashraf was there with her boyfriend who likes polo. Catherine was talking to a beautiful woman and it turned out to be Princess Elisabeth of Yugoslavia who seemed to know me and she asked why I was not at Sharon Hammond's cocktail party the day before. she is trying to get a green card and so is Ira everybody wants a green card. And an interesting thing is that how she knows Sharon is that Mr. Oxenberg Princess Elisabeth's first husband left her for Maureen McCluskey Sharon's sister and I can not figure that out. But anyway Ira's son was so handsome he had the slight kind of accent just the right kind like a kid that you would want to go out on a date with."

Yes I am happy about the $135000 price for the Coke Bottle. Everybody thought it was good. Thomas told me that the Elvis went for $146000. And Thomas bought a Flower painting for $40000. it is worth a lot more though. Someday ... I went to La Cote Basque to meet Mrs. Fortabat the Argentinian lady who bought Whitney Tower's grandmother's Turner for $6 million. she is having her face treated by Karen Burke too. She said she is starting a concrete business in the United States and I told her that meant she would be joining the Mafia and she laughed and told me I was ""charming."""

I invited Sam Bolton Fred's secretary to go with me. Went home and watched Entertainment Tonight while I got ready. And they had on the thing for Dylan at the Whitney the night before which I had not gone to but after seeing this program I felt like I had. They were asking all these people how Dylan had influenced them. And I did not know that he is sold thirty million records. Sam picked me up and we went over there (cab $8). And we had to take off our shoes and now I do but I had a hole in my sock. And we went in and it really was heavy-duty everyone in a circle. The food was all store-bought-cut-up chicken. And David Bowie was there and I was disappointed his suit was too modern. Everybody had champagne but nobody really drank it. Madonna arrived and she had just seen Paul's movie Mixed Blood because that friend of hers is in it. Bobby. She said she was so relieved her husband Sean was not with her so she could really have fun. And she felt uncomfortable without her shoes because she did not have socks-she said she would feel more comfortable with her top off than her shoes off. Yoko had Sean bring out a poster for everybody to sign a donation for someplace and he looked closely at every signature because he was confused who all the people were.

At intermission the people behind us tapped Jean Michel Basquiat and asked if I was really who I was. Dustin was actually good but the play is so old-fashioned. I would seen it years ago with Lee J. Cobb and Mildred Dunnock and they were more like real old people. And afterwards we went backstage and there was coffee and everything and Dustin was really up up up he was camping and screaming ""Andy Warhol is here! Andy Warhol is here!"" And he came over and told us this story about seeing a girl at Sotheby's who was exactly like the first girl he ever fucked and he invited her to the show and then on that exact same night the first girl he ever fucked that she looked exactly like came to see the play. And he took the two of them to dinner and they got to talking and one said she did not have a place to stay and the other said she could stay with her and they went off into the sunset together. They still looked alike he said. And Dustin has a sidekick who writes everything down. he is collecting art and wrote down Jean Michel Basquiat's number and when I saw his hair and everything shaved off I do not know why he does the play in so much makeup when he could just do it straight. And he told me that one day when he saw me on the street and we talked it was the day he would broken up with his first wife which I did not know then and he remembered every word of our conversation because it was such a traumatic day for him."

And then later when I went to the phone and tried to call the office he was waiting for the phone too. He talked about himself and said he did not feel he was creative anymore and that it was probably because he was secure and he asked me how I felt and I said that I was not creative since I was shot because after that I stopped seeing creepy people. Then a kid said to him ""do not you remember me? I was so-and-so is chauffeur and also the first houseboy to work in the Sharon Tate house after the murders."" is not that a great line. there is a rumor that Viva is about to fold."

I love the natural toothpaste I get at Brownies-cinnamon and spearmint-but what I really love is Close-up and Ultra-Brite. Close-up is so good really poisonous-looking. And when Brigid and I go to May's you see people opening the toothpaste tubes and taking a taste. Brigid does that. Worked till 7:30. Dropped Rupert off. Barbara Allen called and was upset with what Scavullo said in the newspaper-that he does not know how some people get into high society because they do not know anything like Barbara Allen. And she had on her high-class voice (cab $6). Then I went to Lee Thaw's party at 72nd and Park for the Maharaja of Baroda because he would just done a book called Palaces of Jaipur published by Alex Gregory who publishes all the big bombs. And the maharaja said he was going to be on To Tell the Truth next week which was so funny because I mean you hear people at these parties saying they are going to be on the Today Show and Meet the Press and things and then he says ""I am going to be on To Tell the Truth."" So they will be guessing who he is. I met Shirley Lord who is English from Vogue. A beauty editor. She was fun. She has big tits. And next to her was Daniel Ludwig the richest man in the world and he was not talking and she wanted to get him to and she knew the odd kinds of information like how scientists can now look with microscopes at babies and predict where their future wrinkles will be. And then I talked to Mary McFadden and she was such a camp. She said ""People put down your portraits and I defend you. I tell them 'At least they have good color!' "" Home at 12:00."

If you went early in the morning you never got anything so I would wait till 12;00 lunchtime because by then they had stopped getting calls and they were tired and you had a better chance. People really do stop calling offices at lunchtime because they assume the people will be out. So we went to the Missoni thing and then went to Le Cirque. Gael was there having dinner with Steven's friend Mr. Mulane the Bally Casino guy. he is really nice he knows everybody. It was pouring rain. Got home and turned on TV and saw that John Tesh our old friend who used to be on the news here is the new main guy on Entertainment Tonight with Mary Hart.

And then the Sacklers were doing this thing at the Metropolitan Club and I was figuring out who to bring and I should have brought Dr. Li I guess because I wound up sitting with Dr. Linus Pauling but I brought Paige and she had a really good time. Dr. Karen Burke would have been all over every man and the wives would have gotten mad at her. there is nobody to go after portraits for me though. we are still missing a Bob Colacello. So cabbed to the Metropolitan Club ($5). And there is Paige sitting downstairs in the hallway. Those horrible doormen there would not let her in because she did not have a fur coat! And we ran into Richard Johnson who works at the Post and he said that Susan Mulcahy just quit. He would be a good eligible person to invite on our blind-date nights. And Dr. Pauling took my arm he was getting an award. Upstairs I was next to Jill Sadder across from Martha Graham and Jill said ""Martha's been dying to meet Linus Pauling for years and now she is next to him and does not know it."" I met a man who said he invented vitamin B or C. And Dr. Pauling was telling us that the only real killer is sugar and then Paige and I were dumbfounded later when they brought dessert and he sat there eating all these cookies.

And then Jean Michel Basquiat started remembering Halston's last Thanksgiving for turkey and wanted to get there so we left (cab $6). The turkey was already put away and dessert was out. Bianca started punching Jean Michel Basquiat and me really hard I actually got a black and blue mark. She was screaming about how we had to contribute to the Brooklyn Academy of Music. And I mean this cheapo-this cunt! Why should she be asking artists when she should be out whoring herself to get money from rich people! Who does she think she is! I mean she thinks she knows all about artists and she knows-shit! She puts on this serious face and interviews them and she thinks something's happening I mean ... she is like a teenager too with this boyfriend Glenn Dubin-she is always rubbing up against him and kissing him. I can not figure out what she is using him for. Maybe just a place to stay.

I guess New York really is booming-when you think that every member of every marching band has to stay in a hotel room overnight. I glued myself together and went down to work (cab $3.50). There was nobody around. I went over to Halston's for Thanksgiving dinner. And meanwhile all this holiday they are still finding more and more bodies in Guyana. They must have known that there were 900. Why were they covering it up in the beginning? How come we did not hear about these people before?

Jed somehow drove straight to the Wyeths' door with just one phone call for directions (phone $.10) at a turnoff right near the place to get the last bit. Arrived around 4:00. The traffic was okay. Barbara Walters did not come after all. Andrew Wyeth Jamie's father was there. Frolic Weymouth was there a neighbor-his wife who is Andrew Wyeth's niece had just left him for an antique dealer or something after lots of married years-he is a du Pont-and he was depressed so he was over for dinner. And Andrew's two sisters one nutty who looks like she drinks and paints. We sat for hours and hours at dinner it was perfect so good. Lots of drinks. I was still so tired from all the traveling at the beginning of the week. Jed went to bed around 2:00 everyone else stayed up until around 4:00. There was a romantic interest going on. Robin West-he is a neighbor of the Wyeths too he works for the Pentagon but he will be losing his job soon because Carter's coming in-he was there and Catherine talked about shit and piss for him and about the Anvil S&M bar and he seemed to like that and got interested. he is looking for a rich girl to marry he asked me where oh where was his tub of butter on the other side of the rainbow and I told him it could be a tub of Guinness beer if he played his cards right.

It was the end and the police left her alone in the house-I do not know why because she was traumatized-I guess they thought the crimes were over and then you hear some guy upstairs coming down calling her name. And you do not know what will happen. And it got me so scared. Got up. The house was empty. Talked to Chris and Peter. Peter's mother had come down from Massachusetts and they were cooking turkey and they invited me to come downtown. Watched the Macy's parade on TV. They had the first woman balloon-Olive Oyl. I called Berkeley Reinhold and she was watching it from her window. She said her mother was making Thanksgiving dinner for the first time. Her father was in Hong Kong so I called John Reinhold there I dialed it direct. He was at the same hotel where we would stayed so it was easy to remember-the Mandarin. I made a faux pas. I told John his wife was making a Thanksgiving dinner and he was upset because she would never made one before. Watched every soap opera and for the holiday every one of the shows had every one of their characters gathered for Thanksgiving dinners. It used to be high-class people in the soap operas and now that is just on Dallas and Dynasty. Now the people on the daytime soaps are lower-middle class-they do not have butlers and maids. Talked to Jon in New Hampshire. Went to Halston's for dinner and Martha Graham was there and she looked frail like she is on her last legs. And then Steve Rubell came and Jane Holzer with her son Rusty who is so handsome now. And he is smart. I talked to him the whole time. He goes to Buckley and he had the highest average and he studies all the time from after school till bedtime and then he studies some more in the morning before school to maintain his 93 average. He said he and another kid were the only ones who knew the answer to the question ""Who painted Campbell's Soup Cans?"" Jade arrived with Bianca she goes to Spence. And I had Rusty go say hello to her and she was aloof she said ""Do I know you?"" and he said ""Of course"" and she said ""Oh yes about a year ago"" and he said ""No two years ago"" and so he was annoyed she was putting him down but Jane explained to him that girls get nervous and do that.

It was Liza and Mark Gero and his mother and father and uncle and three brothers and a Polish girl and Halston and Victor Hugo. The dinner was in the hallway with all my portraits of Liza. It looked really beautiful. And I said to Mark ""I think I have seen this apartment in some magazines"" and he said ""Yeah Batman Comics."" He was funny. And he is the best-looking of the brothers. Liza got the cream. And I figured out that the mother is I think Polish so that is why they have that big Polish-Italian look. One of the brothers is a teacher at Harvard. And I was really crazy I was nutty plus I was drinking good red wine from the Napa Valley. I said ""So now that we have got the whole family here which one is the fairy?"" And the Harvard one did a fairy voice and said ""Mommy which one's the fairy?"" It was funny. The mother is beautiful. Martha Graham was there with her boyfriend Ron Protas and his boyfriend."

I asked her if she wanted to come over and make it look a little like last year. she would just gotten in from London and had had turkey dinner on the plane and said she was the only one on Laker.

Victor had called in the meantime and I invited him to feed the poor with us. I do not know if he is on drugs or if now he is just always paranoid. So we went to the Church of the Heavenly Rest on Fifth Avenue and 90th and the good-looking priest had moved to St. Thomas's that big chic church. And it looked overstaffed-like they had one volunteer for every eater. Everybody had their own waiter. So we went upstairs and there was this big dykey Irish woman giving the helpers their assignments and she said ""Are you here for food?"" And Victor got offended and that started him off insulting people in the line saying ""Just eat fast and fuck off and get out so we can clean up."" This is in a church! And finally I told him ""Victor we are here because we want to be."" And there were a lot of photographers I do not know if they were from the newspapers or what. So this dykey lady says to me ""I am putting you on security to keep people in order."" And I said ""I can not do a thing like that."" And she said ""Well that is what you are going to do."" And I said ""No I am not."" So I ignored her and we served the food and it is such a great church there was food for people to take home too and I was giving everybody a lot. If there is this many hungry people there is really something wrong. A lot of people looked like they just came for a meal so they would not be lonely though. Maybe they even lived on Park Avenue you can not tell. And at the end it was sick the councilmen came in and waved their arms around to show they cared in case there were people taking pictures. We left there and Victor dropped me and said he hated Stephen and Paige and Tama that they were phonies and balonies and then later he called and was saying he knew I was taping him on the phone and so he was talking ""to the people on the other side of the tape recorder"" and I do not know if he is on drugs or if he is just hallucinating on his own. there is something wrong with him. I saw our Cars video ""Hello Again"" on MTV. They ran it again and it still looks really good. I can not believe it came out of our place. And I can not believe nobody else had us to do their videos after that. Oh and I bought some magazines. A lot of them ($25). I walked the dogs and Paige called but I was too cozy to go out to dinner. And then Jean Michel Basquiat called and he is furious at Paige because he finally found out about his father playing the cannibal in Paige's pictorial spread for Tama's book A Cannibal in Manhattan he would just seen the item on Page Six about it. He said ""What is she trying to do? Is she after my father?"" And he said his father's writing a book and he said (laughs) ""he is not even a drug addict-how can he write a book? About what?"" that is the first time I ever heard Jean Michel Basquiat say something funny. I wonder if that is his sense of humor. And he did not go to Germany for his big show."

She said she would been meeting with lawyers all day and we said how could you get them on Thanksgiving and she said ""Money talks."" Halston always has the best mince pie with a circle in the center-I do not know where he gets it. Nobody ever eats it and he is the one who likes it but he does not eat it either.

And anyway I hate her because I keep on remembering that it was her and Jean Stein that got me in all this IRS trouble because they are the ones that asked me to do a McGovern poster and I wanted to do something clever so I got that bright idea to do a green face of Nixon with ""Vote McGovern"" under it. And that is when the IRS got so interested in me. Walked to the new offices on 33rd Street and picked up a phone and made my first phone call from there. I was there to scout corners where we could store props. it is filled up already and I have not even moved my stuff in yet. And my house is starting to look so bad too. I want to take pictures of the clutter but my camera focuses on areas so small that everything just looks neat because I do not get the bigger picture of the big mess that the little areas are all part of.

Went to photograph a lady who is sort of a German Diane Von Furstenberg she is a top clothes manufacturer-her company's called Tink or Fink. The house was beautiful. She was dressed really like a businesswoman though in a velvet suit with hankies coming out of everywhere. She was really sweet and all the pictures came out well. After a long drive to Dusseldorf Chris and I had a fight because the walls at the Breitenbacher Hof Hotel are very thin and through the wall I could hear Christopher in his room making phone calls and I got nervous because I am hearing him dial eighteen digits and I know he is calling long distance to Peter Wise in New York and it is expensive.

I am not kidding! I do not know how that happened if they were there and just coincidentally were sitting with him but it seemed like this was the dinner that Larry was supposed to be giving for me. Fred was mumbling something like that he would wanted to talk business with them alone or something. But I do think this dinner was supposed to be for me and that he would told me it was cancelled just so I would not go. And Gagosian told me ""I got your Rorschach Test for my California show"" and I said ""Where did you get it?"" He said ""From Leo"" and I said ""Oh really? Did you buy it?"" and he said ""No it is consigned."" I said ""Well you can not have it."" I got mad and tough. Because it is just one more show not to have.

She had a gallery in Soho and Jean Michel Basquiat used to do paintings in her basement. She would bring people down to look at him like an attraction and he would yell ""Get the fuck out of here!"" He destroyed twenty paintings once he ripped them off the walls. And after she reminded him of all these old days he felt funny being at this chic uptown place. he is not happier now that he is uptown because it is all before him now and he does not know what to do. I told him ""Look those tantrums were not real anyway."" he is confused. Stayed till 11:30."

Then ran to yoga class but since yoga is calming I did not want to really rush so I ran but calmly but by then the girl had gone. I was seeing Dr. Rees at 2:30. I called the office and told Brigid to meet me at Tiffany's and we would shop until my appointment. Got to Dr. Rees's on East 72nd Street and I had to fill out forms and I saw the doctor and he was dying to do my face. I told him what I really wanted was a few mini-lifts that I just wanted to go in for a little bit on different days. But he said he would have to do it all at once that he would cut all around the ear and he showed me how it would look. He said I would be black and blue for a while and I would have to stay in town for two weeks. So I told him I would think about it. Cabbed to meet Don Munroe ($6.50). He and Vincent were setting up to shoot me for our segment on Saturday Night Live. We did our lines and I was terrible I do not think it is funny-three reels an hour and a half of work. But then later Vincent said they really liked it and I asked if I had to go down to do any more on it and he said no. I am scared about this Saturday Night Live thing. Jon thinks I should not be doing it because if it is bad so many people will see it so I am hoping they do not use it after all.
"Thursday, October 1, 1986","[Andrea Reynolds, James Brady, Steve Rubell]",-0.12523024361259658,"Fred called me in the morning really mad he said how could Paige and Vincent and I have put an ad for Andy Warhol portraits in the Neiman-Marcus catalog. He was in Europe or something when we did it and he was so mad saying how tacky it was and that we are the laughingstock of Texas. I just said life was too short to get so upset about a stupid mistake. I went to see Bernsohn and he said he would just bought $2500 worth of Charivari clothes and that he was going to fill up his closet with Armani and I am thinking ""God so this is why he charges so much."" Invited Sam and Wilfredo to James Brady's New York Deli party for his book. Got stuck at the door with Steve Rubell talking at me and spitting in my face the way he does. Claus von Bulow's girlfriend Andrea Reynolds was there. She said she throws a chicken in the pot for Claus because she believes rich people should cook. she is so stupid. God. It was a funny nothing party. After dinner we went down to the Puck building for the party for the first issue of Spy magazine (cab $7). Dropped Sam (cab $6). Wilfredo too. Home at 12:00 and watched The Tonight Show and all these TV people have these white white teeth and there is nothing else that white on the whole show. It drives me crazy. can not they make them more natural?"

And then late in the day the news was that Orson Welles had died and they were putting them up as if they were both equal. Oh but it was such a pleasure to meet Orson Welles before he died. He was really great. I do not mean his movies I mean him. All the governments were just lying so much about the Achille Lauro thing yesterday. If I were the Klinghoffers I would just go to the trial and shoot them the four of them. I would not be able to get off four shots in a courtroom but then I would just get one. I would not care which one. One would be enough. I know I know-yesterday I was so worried about killing a cockroach. But this is different-the cockroach did not do anything to anybody and I did not kill it right so it was squirming and it was so big it would lived to be so big. Oh listen there is going to be a war. let us stockpile things. Silk stockings. Candy bars (cab $4.30 phone $1.50 newspapers $2). The Coleco Cabbage Patch guy came by. And he did not like the paintings of Cabbage Patch dolls I did but he is paying anyway. And we were talking and he said that Peter Max was his inspiration that he used to be an illustrator and now he is an executive. He proposed that he do an Andy Warhol line of clothing with me and that we could both make lots of money. He said that his computer had told him that I was the most famous living artist. I told him I knew a person who was ready to go with clothes Stephen Sprouse. he would never heard of him. And I told him about Keith Haring and the T-shirts and Keith's store and he would never heard of him either. Oh and everybody's talking about The Love Boat. The ad for it in TV Guide only shows the Mermaid Dancers not me. Why did not they get me on the cover?
"Thursday, October 11, 1979",[Larry Rivers],0.16821969696969694,"Got up and it was raining cold again. Somebody ran into Truman in New Orleans so evidently he did not go to Nebraska. Maybe he just needed some money-he asked us for $6000 to go to Nebraska to do a story for Interview and we gave it to him. I worked all afternoon in the back. Fred was in one of those moods mussing people's hair up and he invited Curley to go to the Larry Rivers show at Marlborough with us. Larry's show is like a retrospective of all his work. it is funny it is like he ran out of ideas and decided to repaint everything. In the elevator I ran into the Greek woman whose portrait I just did but I did not recognize her. And I also ran into Rupert who said my Gem screens came out okay. At the opening a guy said ""I am Larry's brother-in-law and I own the building your office is in"" and he said that he would just rented the ground floor to a discotheque but that we should not worry that it would not interfere with us because it would not be going on during our business hours. I told him thanks a lot. So I mean is not that great? The Mafia discotheque fires will only burn the place to the ground after office hours. is not that wonderful a discotheque for a neighbor. Then I went to dinner at the Gilmans' where I met a lawyer who is in New York to go to tax-shelter school."

On the tenth floor! So I got pangs going over there riding up in that elevator to the floor where Interview used to be. Bob MacBride has the room next to that. it is too bad we did not buy that building though because it is narrow and Interview could have had four floors already. Bob's stuff now I really like it I honestly do. it is bent wood sculpture. Truman was bouncing around. I do not know if he is drinking or not. We got a call-the call I did not want to get-saying that we had to go to Paris next week the twentieth Friday for the Piss paintings. Dropped Bob on Park at 7:00 ($3.20). The police just arrested Sid Vicious for stabbing his twenty-year-old manager-girlfriend to death in the Chelsea Hotel and then I saw on the news that Mr. Bard was saying ""Oh yeah. They drank a lot and they would come in late...."" They just let anybody in over there that hotel is dangerous it seems like somebody's killed there once a week. I was tired so I stayed home did some drawings worked watched TV snoozed. Then the alarm system went off and I was afraid to go down and look but finally I got brave and took Archie under my arm and went down to the kitchen but there was nothing there. I watched TV but kept worrying that there was someone in the house. All Fall Down. When Brandon De Wilde kicks the picture of Warren Beatty and Angela Lansbury grabs it and holds it close it is so good you know? Who wrote that movie? Was it the one who committed suicide who was like Tennessee Williams? The one who wrote Picnic ... Inge."

So rushed (cab $6.50). She was already there but it took her one or two hours to get dressed. And they wanted pictures of me taking the pictures of her so I called Chris and he came over. she is pretty but she looks forty. She looks like she is really been through the mill. But they know how to pull her together. She had a Japanese makeup guy. Paul Morrissey was there driving us all up the wall. He wants to do a remake of Pepe Le Moko with children. Paul does have good ideas though so if we could just work with him and get him to not think the old-fashioned drug-trash way	He had Brigid retyping some contracts.
"Thursday, October 15, 1981",[Nancy Reagan],0.036751893939393945,-New York-Washington D.C.-New York We were early getting to the White House we got in and then Nancy Reagan came in and we were in the same room. And a waiter brought in four glasses of water. Doria was with us. We talked about drug rehabilitation and it was boring. I made a couple of mistakes but I did not care because I was still so mad at being told by Bob not to ask sex questions. She had an assistant who sat there and took notes and they said they were not doing their own tape of the interview but I am sure they were. Bob had his tape recorder and I had mine. I took four pictures. Mrs. Reagan gave Doria a piece of Tupperware not wrapped or anything and she gave her three boxes of socks for Ron. Bob was telling Mrs. Reagan she was such a good mother. He asked what they were doing for Christmas and she said they were going to stay at the White House because nobody ever stays at the White House. At 4:30 the interview was over. She and Doria talked for about fifteen minutes while Bob and I waited to the side. Then we got a cab to the airport. Got to New York called Jon at the office. Gave Doria $20 for the cab after she dropped me. When I walked in the door the phone was ringing and it was Brigid asking me what kind of tea Mrs. Reagan served us and then I started thinking and I got madder. I mean she could have put on the dog-she could have done it in a good room she could have used the good china! I mean this was for her daughter-in-law she could have done something really great for this interview but she did not. I got madder and madder thinking about it.

She came with her husband Raphael and the friend Xavier. The Tiffany's guy arrived with the jewelry. And David White came by with a letter from Rauschenberg-David works for him now-saying that the tables I have were done by him because he did them when Jane Holzer was trying to go into the art furniture business in the late sixties or early seventies and then the business fell through and I got them. So it is great that Rauschenberg wrote the letter saying they were by him because now maybe someday he will sign them. Then Juan Hamilton called and said that he and Georgia O'Keeffe were at the Mayfair and they were coming down at 4:30 and I said to come right away because Paloma was there so they did. Everyone was thrilled with everyone. People thought Juan was going to marry Georgia but he just got married to someone else and now his wife is expecting a baby. Georgia was wearing a black thing around her head. This time she seemed really old. You have to catch her every minute as if she will sit in a chair that is not there. But on the video Vincent made she looked young and alert. She does know everything that is going on it is just that she moves older now. Then they all left. Rupert came up and then I got some work done. Worked till 8:30 and Jay Shriver agreed to stay late too. Then because they worked overtime I invited Rupert and Jay to 65 Irving and I had John Reinhold meet us there. Jay's from Milwaukee. He said his mother is all Czechoslovakian. Not from there but a hundred percent. Oh and Mary Tyler Moore's son committed suicide and now Ordinary People is really going to do business and everybody's going to really hate her because they will be thinking that that is really the way she is.
"Thursday, October 16, 1986",[Dick Cavett],0.1133986928104575,"Brigid's really upset because her mother's really bad and she finally is realizing she will be an orphan. Had to leave the office early at 6:30 because it was the night of a Japanese boat ride party and it was black tie and I had a black tie with me but I only had white Reeboks but Fred and I went over anyway. Rupert came by with finally some good paintings that I have done. I could actually have a good show 10' x 36' Camouflages. So the car picked us up. I could not close the alarm and I looked like a mess and I just knew it was one of those things where they treat you like royalty to get you there but then when you step off the boat at the end of the ride they will not even hand you a token for the subway they have already ""had"" you. Mr. Kuraoka from Nippon was so cute it was all his food. And Dick Cavett got Bianca to talk on mike and she took a look at me and said ""What are you wearing?"" I am telling you I was really a mess. My buttons did not button my tie was not straight the turtleneck was showing through the white shirt. And Skitch Henderson was there and I told him how much I missed him on TV and how he really developed that whole format of the host talking to the bandleader that they still use. And all I could think of was that big tax problem he would had. It lasted till 9:30 and Fred was his old self charming and nice to everyone. But at the end he whispered ""let us be the first off the boat."" And sure enough there was no car for us. They do absolutely everything to get you there and absolutely nothing to get you home. So we paid a limo ($25) to take us and Fred dropped me."

I can just see the whole thing-he will want a house and a dog and a car in a settlement. I mean this is a real nag. But when you tell people they do not listen to anything when they are in love. Instead they go tell the person you are talking about what you said. it is human nature. they are in love and they do not see it and they blab. Vincent said the Times was going to write about our TV show Fifteen Minutes. And it got a great review in the Voice this week. Went over to the Forbes boat for the annual benefit for Jonas Mekas's archives. Jonas bought a new building. I saw him and he laughed and said his horoscope had said do not buy real estate and he bought it for $50000 and now it is worth a million. I do not know why these Hollywood people do not give Jonas prints of just everything. he is one of the only people who still really cares. They should just give him things. I can not believe that Hollywood does not even have one film museum. it is just disgusting. you would think they could at least do that. And Shirley Clark was there looking the same as she did fifty years ago. And the returns came in-the Stallone issue of Interview was our biggest seller ever."

He said that at a party I took a picture of him but I must have been aiming at somebody behind him. He looks like he wants to be Buck Henry. I had not invited them for lunch and they saw all the leftover food from the big lunch Bob had just had so I had to make some excuse and Nelson's so paranoid anyway. Richard Weisman said he needed some girls for the ""21"" thing before the Ali fight so I invited Barbara Allen. And she wanted to bring John Samuels so I asked Richard and he said yes. Worked till 7:30 on portraits with Rupert. I found out the fight did not start till 11:00 so I wondered why we had to get to ""21"" at 7:30. I answered the phones. Then cabbed uptown ($5). ""21"" was doing this special thing for its good customers I guess it was cocktails at 7:30 and dinner at 8:30. Then they gave us tickets to go over to Radio City Music Hall and see the fight and invited us back to ""21"" for a light supper afterwards. John McEnroe Sr. was there with a friend from the Paul Weiss office who said he was our lawyer but I did not know him. There were Ali posters and ""I Am the Greatest"" buttons. I was trying not to drink too much. They kicked us out when they said we were going to miss the fight. We went through the Warner's building and over to Radio City. The Spinks fight was on and then the Muhammad Ali fight came on and I could not watch it I ate all my fingers on one side. The audience could not believe it when he lost. It was too unreal. And he had makeup on he looked so handsome it was like white makeup and his face was not shiny and Holmes's face was black and shiny. Then we went back to ""21"" and I introduced Barbara Allen to John Coleman. John Samuels fell in love with Walter Cronkite and was talking to him at the bar and I got John away because he was drunk. Then Richard wanted to take us to a new singles-swingles restaurant and he invited three blonde girls along and Barbara did not like that. She was talking about John Samuels saying ""Oh look he is just like Peter Beard-he walks like Peter he talks like Peter oh look he runs like Peter he eats like Peter!"" I said ""What are you talking about?"" Because I mean they are nothing alike. And Barbara was saying she could not wait until Bianca came back and found her with John- ""What do you think Bianca will think? What will she say? Well maybe I will let her have him when she gets back. What will she think though?"" And here John had just said to me ""I can not wait till Averil gets back-I am going to meet her at the airport."" Bob had gotten Barbara a joint because she asked him and she was more thrilled with that than anything else. So we left and started to walk home this is around 79th Street and then we heard all these cop cars and we saw a crowd and John ran right up and into it and it was a dead person on the street. So we asked people and finally a doorman told us that three guys had just walked by and he thought they looked strange and then they had picked on an undercover cop and tried to rob him and the cop had shot and killed one of them. And John just wanted to be in the thick of it and Barbara was upset. And it was just awful seeing the Ali fight and that was violent and then this and so we got a cab and the driver seemed crazy to me. Barbara said he was Greek but I think he was Puerto Rican and saying crazy things because he thought it was a Puerto Rican that would got shot. So I dropped Barbara off and watched her go into her building and then just as we were driving past Lenox Hill Hospital the body was going in that we would just seen lying on the street (cab $4)! When I got home I did not have Barbara's number to call her and tell her I got home safely so I called Bob to get it and he told me that Barbara had told him that everyone was after John Samuels-""especially Andy""-and I told him to call her up and tell her off-that if I would wanted John Samuels I knew him before she did and I would only invited him to this thing because I thought it would make her happier. And that actually Richard had wanted another girl not her. So there!"

I took Sam to the Whitney Museum party for Keith and Kenny that I was hosting. Michel Roux of Absolut Vodka was giving it. Keith asked me what big movie stars I was bringing. He said Nick Rhodes was in town and I do not know why Nick has not called me. I know he is been here a while. he is being distant. Got to the Whitney early had to do some press. Some museum people were there but Tom Armstrong was not. Later he said he did not come down because he was ""upstairs hanging Sargents."" Another distant person. And Cornelia was distant too. And then we went upstairs because it was cooler there. Jane Holzer came around 8:30 and we walked to Mortimer's and the block was roped off for the party. Peter Allen sang inside but I missed it and later when he asked me if I heard it and I said no he turned away. Another distant person. If I run into Sylvia Miles and she s distant I will know I am really in trouble. Then at 9:15 we left. Jane and I went to La Reserve at 4 West 49th for the dinner that Michel Roux was giving for Keith and Kenny they have both done paintings of the Absolut Vodka bottle. Had fun there. Jane walked me home. I watched Letterman and I liked the lady admiral he had on. Oh and Quentin Crisp was at the Whitney and he looks younger than ever just great. He told me that Letterman when you are on his show it is like being out with a gay guy-you know how they are always looking past you looking around for somebody better. He said that is what Letterman's like on the air. And I took my quarter-Valium and went to bed. And I guess I have to confess to the Diary that I am a Valium addict. I am addicted. Because I read in the paper the symptoms and I have got them. And starting in December you are going to need more signatures to get them so I will have to stock up now."

And Pontus Hulten called and wants a free thing so I cabbed down to meet him (cab $6.50 supplies $7 $6.62 $2.79 $3.19). it is always the same thing-a free print for a free museum for a free benefit and he does these things that are great and then they fire him. Like at the Beaubourg they fired him because he is not French after he did that big thing there. And now he is opening a museum in California. But I mean he wants things for free he thinks he is living in a Socialist country. it is like Jonas Mekas that same type of thing. And I forgot to say that the other day Governor Jerry Brown called and said ""Hi Andy it is nice talking to you. We know each other and you know how I feel about art and if you could do some art for me then along with the other artists I could put your art up as collateral and get a loan from the bank and fund my run for the senate...""I told him to talk to Fred. I mean he could have had me do his portrait while he was governor and the city or the state could have paid for it they were having to do his portrait anyway.

The bar was on Ninth Avenue in the 50s. The driver said that he just fed the cat then let it out like he always did only this time the cat did not go back to the bar and the owner accused him of trying to sell it as a replacement for Morris. The jury deliberated for three hours before finding him innocent so he felt he was a celebrity.

The Richard Gere issue was I think our biggest seller yet even though the interview inside was so bad. So it does not matter it is just if it is somebody they want to read about.

One was an American married to a Chinese the others were Miss America types-Miss Taiwan Miss This and That and they would married rich guys from the construction business and they all hate each other and they are all beautiful. Burmese and Chinese and all gorgeous dolls dressed to kill. And after lunch Alfred's beautiful wife took us to a place where they do fortune telling and it was like 8000 fortune tellers and you had to pick the one you wanted so I picked this lady and I asked how my love life was and (laughs) she said I am married to a younger lady and I am having problems. And then Chris began taking photographs and he took some of sleeping fortune tellers and the flash woke them up and they chased us all out of the place-I guess none of them wanted their picture taken because of the evil eye or whatever it is. Alfred had a dinner party and it was so glamorous we took a junk out to his private boat. He imported a crew from New York to photograph us while we were there and they were awful seven of them and I do not even want to remember their names. We all went to Disco-Disco a drag queen place and an English girl came up to me and wanted to dance and I did not want to and she said ""you are not anything like what they write about in the papers"" and I said ""Well I know that."""

The Enquirer article that Frank Sinatra is suing over said that when he gets up in the morning he is so worried about aging that he asks his wife Barbara ""How do I look today?"" Oh Frankie. I remember when I walked all the way into Pittsburgh to see him to see what all the girls were swooning about and there were not any girls there swooning. I went in and met this other kid to go see him sing with Tommy Dorsey. It was one of my first things that I did alone going into town and seeing him. Went to the Whitney. I was there to ""advertise"" my Campbell's Soup Box painting. And for all the work and publicity I should have charged them like $250000-I mean they are a huge company-instead of just the cost of a portrait. We must be getting desperate. Me standing there twenty years later and still with a Campbell's soup thing it felt like a New Yorker cartoon. And Rita Moreno was there I guess she is a spokesman for Campbell's and they were treating me more important than her saying they only wanted to photograph me and she said ""But he asked me to be in the picture"" and they said ""We only want him."" Because it is just that it is a different category. it is like when I have done the portrait of a big baseball player they photograph him and I am shoved aside. And I was so hurt-I saw Dolly Parton's picture in the paper she is in town she and Sandy Gallin went to a Broadway show and they did not even call me. I have not gotten the real story of the portrait yet. I will get it out of Steve Rubell sometime when he is drunk. All the headlines were that Rock Hudson died. Keith called to tell me that Grace Jones would be performing at the Garage at 4:00 in the morning. So how can I do that? Go to bed and get up early?"

We had to sit around with them for an hour so the dummy-makers could study my face to see if I would be a good dummy. And they were funny-looking the people from Walt Disney or someplace like that. And if a dummy moves and it makes say three mouth movements and two eye movements that takes 100 motors and every time you add another movement you have to add like 20 more motors inside the figure. We still have not signed with Lewis Allen because we sent the contract up to Paul Weiss and they said it was a ridiculous piece of paper because it is so involved.

And we got to LaGuardia and Craig Nelson was standing out there (magazines $8) and we got the shuttle to Washington. We were picked up at the airport by a lady who had a small car. She took us to a radio show and this guy was supposed to be the neatest guy in town and it was the most horrible interview. I was still too upset about the night before and I could not think of anything funny and he wanted to know about the book and I did not know anything and he said ""I guess you did not write the book"" and I said ""I guess I did not."" It was one of his most difficult interviews. He will remember it. And on these trips God I hate Craig so much. he is there saying ""Andy and I are both interested in sex."" And I am saying ""Craig I am not interested in sex."" I mean Chris is like a piece of heaven compared to Craig. Although (laughs) actually they are alike. They just think food food food and what they can take home. Although Craig is fatter. And they are both pigeon-toed. But Christopher is finally paying his dues coming with me to these things-he is not even taking pictures and getting phone numbers he is actually working taking care of me and organizing me. The lady with the small car drove us to the airport and the plane was late left at 8:50 and we ran into Susan Mulcahy. She did not seem to have heard what had happened to me at Rizzoli she would been away from work at the Post I guess maybe she had not gone in that day so I did not know what to do. When you are friends with the person are you supposed to tell them and are they then supposed to not write it or what? I did not know what you do. So I did not say anything and she was self-conscious because I would caught her down there. I guess maybe she was seeing a person that she is having an affair with and she was all feminine and looked so pretty like she was just through with a hard day of making out. So she was not thinking about me she was worried about herself. And so then Chris and Craig dropped me off and I knew when I left the cab that they were going to dish me even though they do not get along. Craig'd been telling people what had happened on Wednesday all day. And I was exhausted and I ate garlic bread and went to bed at 1:00."
"Thursday, October 6, 1977",[Rodney La Rod],0.15,Woke up with a sore throat and I think it is from kissing all those funny girls who come running over to me. I never used to do that but they are just there and you do not want to be rude. I just love all the boys at Studio 54. they are like Rodney La Rod was in the sixties-all jangling nerves and they are all hustlers and they (laughs) prey on movie producers they want to be famous and they can not wait.
"Thursday, October 6, 1983",[Jean Michel Basquiat],0.37563131313131315,-Milan Did five or ten interviews this day they kept coming in one at a time. Went out to lunch at some great restaurant. Really good food people looked so beautiful think we did a lot of Interview advertising work. Had a big dinner at some new disco place with all the beautiful models. Got home. Jean Michel Basquiat came by and said he was depressed and was going to kill himself and I laughed and said it was just because he had not slept for four days and then after a while of that he went back to his room.
"Thursday, October 8, 1981",[Jasper Johnses],-0.03067580567580568,I had a fight with Jon so I was not taking his calls. Rupert came up with some Dollar Signs but they were looking like Jasper Johnses sort of. Vincent had gone up to Sotheby's to the auction where they had some of my portfolios and he bought them back. Some Campbell's Soup Cans and some Maos. But not the Marilyns because the Marilyn prices have stayed up they are around $3 5000 apiece now. Mrs. Castelli's having a prints show soon so Vincent was bidding against Castelli Graphics and I guess Leo was mad but ... Nelson came down and wanted to work on the Saturday Night Live thing. I think for my next show I am going to paint and talk about painting.

It was fascinating but I do not know if I really could believe it. She would be great if she could tell you in the hour after a child was missing where he was-that would really do something. She should sit by her phone. Glued myself together and picked up Bob and Diana Vreeland to go to the Winships' for dinner. Diana was wearing a beautiful Valentino (cab $2). Got there and it was really cozy a dinner party for Zandra Rhodes. The Carimatis were there and Ralph Destino and Andre Gregory. Ralph told me he was in love and that he was going to get married and for the third day in a row I gave somebody the lecture not to get married which I really have to stop. And then I made a big bet with him and I am scared to find out who is right. A portrait-sized bet. it is whether Rita Hayworth was born in Brooklyn. I said she was not. I asked him for a 40 percent discount at his store Cartier. With 40 percent they still make a 10 percent profit. Zandra Rhodes had an upsweep of purple and pink hair. The Winship lady had on a plain Zandra dress. Zandra's fiance Couri Hay came after dinner. he is trying to play it heavy with Zandra so I brought up his wife. Oh you know his ""wife"" that boy. And he tells Zandra to be freakier and I told her she should play down the freak stuff now that the colored hair was sort of old-fashioned. In front of Zandra he said when I asked him why he did not put her in his columns he said because nobody knew who she was."

Now in looking at him he is really good-looking a good nose and good hair-1 could do a really good one of just his head. Jean Michel Basquiat called and I am just holding my breath for the big fight he will pick with me right before the show of our collaboration paintings at the Shafrazi Gallery. The opening's on Saturday. Oh and I would given a $1200 bid to the girl at the auction place for a bracelet and so after the auction she called to say that it went for $850 but that she just did not get my bid in on time. And I said ""Oh is not that great."" I mean I can live without it because I can live without anything but it was nice. And I keep going to that lady who has the earrings that match the ring I gave PH and instead of coming down on the price she is going up all the time. it is one of these desperate people that they get something in their head. she is stubborn. I should try to get her on a day when she has to pay her bills. I called Stephen Sprouse to have dinner at II Cantinori (cab $6). And then Paloma came in with Fran Lebowitz and with her husband. And I said to them ""Why do not you join us?"" And Fran piped up with ""No! we are waiting for someone."" And they were not. No one ever showed up. So I think Fran is just horrible because they could have made the dinner fun-I have not talked to Paloma in a long while."

But you do feel energy when you leave there. And the same with Dr. Li-you feel energy. So something is happening. That guy Christopher made me go to I did not feel different at all. But these ones do something. Like when Eizo made his hand sweat just by concentrating. Dr. Bernsohn is strange he said he was living with his parents until just recently. Now he is buying a co-op. He said he will give me stones that've been programmed for him but he will reprogram them for me. And he said he wants to come down and look at my paintings to see the vibrations he gets from them but I am afraid he will see a $50000 one and say ""I want that."" And then what will I do? If I say no he will want to cure me of negativity. it is like a-what is that word?-a ""scam."" But then you do feel energy so it is working. And the healing people do have such hot hands. There must be something to it. Cabbed to 52nd and Lex to meet Jonas Mekas and Timmy Forbes at Nippon (cab $6). they are trying to raise money for the Filmmaker's Co-op. I asked Jonas if he would seen any movies lately and he said no that he was just trying to raise money. And really (laughs) he never saw movies. He never did. Worked on the Truman Capote cover for New York."

Bob told him I was mad at him and amazingly that made him stop. I think that is the bee that sticks in his bonnet when someone tells him ""You have to cool it."" Then he does. Like Stevie told him that once. I guess so many people have told him. We went to Halston's and got into limos to go over to Studio 54 for Dr. Giller's birthday. There was a cake with a syringe (laughs) that said ""Dr. Feelgood."" I ran into Barbara Allen and she was laughing. She said that she would just been up in the balcony with one of the Robert Kennedy sons-the one with buck teeth who looks really like his father-and he took out a joint so they could smoke it and when he lit the match he paused and looked into Barbara's eyes and said ""When I look into a flame I see the face of my uncle."" You know the Eternal Flame. I left and the bouncer got me a cab and I tried to give him $10 but he would not take it (cab $2.50)."

Made calls was very nervous ordered lunch had more Valium ordered a limo and went to the White House and got in easy. Bob and I went with our dates. My date was Frances Bergen Charley McCarthy's (laughs) mother. And she was not interested in me at all she got away as soon as she could. And the Marine introduced me on the line as ""Mr. World"" and then the girl sergeant escorting me said that she was nervous that it was her first time doing this. They asked me why I was invited and I said because Mrs. Marcos lived on my street. The Valiums were not really working but then the dinner was outside in the garden and it was so beautiful and it was dark so it was fine. And they took a chance no tent and it was beautiful that way but you get shoved and pushed so much from place to place. Only about eighty people. Then they turned on four billion lights. No TV cameras though so I was not nervous. The president's table was right behind me. The president of you.S. Steel was at my table and I said ""Oh I am from Pittsburgh and my poor brother is out of work from the steel mill""-I was lying like crazy-""and he is lost his mill job and what you should do is put one of the unused buildings to use and make it into a Disney World and give tours and charge people $10 to get a little coal on their faces and see the hot lava being poured"" and he said ""Oh what a great idea why did not I think of that?"" The Vice-president Bushes were at our table and she said that she knew somebody I knew but now I can not remember who it was. Then the speeches came and the president made his quick and then Marcos was slow. I relaxed. And then the Fifth Dimension came on and sang ""Up Up and Away"" and there is more new members than old. I asked one of the marines if there was a pay phone and everyone laughed at me. Bob wanted to stay on and dance. I got the limo and went back to the hotel. Called Jon and then fell asleep at 12:00."

He was in 2-D and he had two secretaries. He looked like a Hollywood doctor. Wrinkled but healthy-looking young white curly hair. Jewish. And he was like a psychiatrist he asked me questions about my life and nodded and jotted things down. I told him I was born in 1931. Look they do not know it does not matter. And before I told him that I lost my pigment and hair when I was young he looked at my hair (laughs) and said ""I hope you do not mind cutting off some of your hair for a check on it."" So I told him I was there because of pimples because I want to model. We talked about vitamins and he told me all vitamins are chemicals and that vitamin C is made from corn. It took an hour and he prescribed so many medicines like tryptophan because I said I could not sleep. And I told him I would taken that and that it made me feel so peculiar and he said ""Well then just take one."" And he told me that a fresh apple is the best thing to have before bed because it has some sleeping powder in it. And I told him that I would read that a turkey sandwich and a glass of milk was the best thing and he said that was too. And he told me to eat a lot of bananas because I told him I could not remember things or something. Walked with Bob over to Barneys for the opening of the new top floor that that Peter Marino designed and it is nice up there-little shops where they sell dishrags and jellies and things. We went to the Armani room for lunch. Gene Pressman the son of the owner told me I could get a discount on anything because of the ads I am modeling in for them."

She said they only cost thirty-five cents but I proved that they cost $2. Bob was in a better mood because he moved into his new bigger office. Jay Shriver is really good at straightening up the place. Senator Heinz's wife called and said that I just had to come to her dinner in Washington next week because she is planned on Jamie and me and it was in my honor. Ronald Reagan Jr.'s people called to say he would agreed to be interviewed by me for Interview which I did not know anything about. Joanne Winship was calling me all day about whether I was picking up Carolina Herrera to take to her Italian Boy Scouts charity dinner which I was but I wanted to wait to call Carolina in order to drive Mrs. Winship crazy. Mrs. Winship threatened that if I did not let her know right then that she was going to send a car for Carolina which I knew she would not. I picked Carolina up and she was wearing one of her creations she has about twenty that she did herself she is going into the designing business that is why she is here staying in New York. We got a cab and went to the Pierre ($3). Monique Van Vooren was there and she wanted her picture taken with me so we did and then I walked away but then she grabbed me and said how dare I ""dump"" her and I said ""Oh come on Monique you are crazy."" She said ""How could you drop me! I am going to be so big next year."" Then Monique sat at our table and Joanne Winship said ""These disgusting people who sit where they are not supposed to!"" And Monique said ""Oh you bitch."" And Joanne said ""You phony you are my guest and you will sit where I put you!"" It was so nutty Joanne was a raving maniac. I loved it. I just wanted a tape recorder so badly. Fred got left for a second and when he came back Joanne saw him sit back down next to Mrs. Vreeland where he would been sitting before and she screamed ""How dare you sit in that spot!"" Poor Fred he would just gotten up to go to the bathroom. Then Ron Link who'd staged the fashion show before the dinner sat down at our table and Joanne screamed at him and then he hated her and left and then Joanne told Monique he would left because of her.

This is the second try and poor Paige just as it was happening they get word about the Mexican earthquake which was really bad-maybe a 7.8. This kid has no luck this artist. Jean Michel Basquiat picked me up in a limo and we went to Rockefeller Center to a party that this Steven Greenberg guy was giving in his office which is two floors above the Rainbow Room. Two terraces and the art was worth around $10 million. This Greenberg-he has a white pageboy hairdo-is the one who got me the live demonstration job with the Commodore computer at Lincoln Center. The Debbie Harry thing. he is an investor I guess. Someone said he gives business advice to companies and takes stock as payment. He also got Clive Davis to use us. And there were so many young kids just great. Beautiful makeup androgynous boys just beautiful. Downtown kids. And I was just thinking if only the Rainbow Room could get revitalized it would be so great. On the way to Area we decided to go to Odeon. When we were at Odeon I asked for the paper and there in Friday's Times I saw a big headline: ""Jean Michel Basquiat and Warhol in Pas de Deux.""

We went to 48th and Broadway (cab $3). I was five minutes late and they would started the movie. It was out of focus it only went into focus about four times. It was a double screen filmed in video and transferred onto film it had a girl masturbating in a shower. Then the film looked like it broke and we did not know if it had or if it was the end of the movie and none of us dared to ask so we just sat there in the dark and then finally when a guy came out of the projection booth carrying the film we knew it was really over. We did not know what to say and the girl showing it wanted us to say something so finally I said ""I liked it"" and she was relieved."

And so I went into the room and it was like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. An old lady like in her sixties pudgy and like a meat market guy and the doctor was a big guy like from Hick City. And the room was so little. And they run their hand over you in funny places and say code letters you know and they will say they have run into a ""hole"" or something like ""there is a hole here escaping"" and they will say ""C85 14 15 D-23 circumvent 18 75 dash 4...."" And then he said something and Dr. Bernsohn said ""Oh he does not have any feeling""-about me. And the doctor said to me ""I will tell you about it next week"" after the other doctor said ""I did not know I had such an extreme case."" But afterwards I was not spaced-out or anything. When we would walked in there was a guy in a daze. Afterwards Benjamin and I we went to Fraser Morris and got lunch and ate it on the ledge at the Whitney Museum we did not even know it was the Pop Art show inside. And a woman came by and saw me eating chicken and said ""that is a no-no"" and she was right. I am not supposed to eat meat. But I am trying to be more normal. I signed a lot of autographs. Then we went up to Vito Giallo's store and ran into Paloma Picasso who is just in town for a day to promote her perfume. she is so skinny again it is incredible and no lines. Good newspaper headlines about Muhammad Ali having some disease. I got them for the new Front Page paintings I want to do. And John Reinhold called me yesterday morning and said that the Polish Institute next door to me was being sold and that he would gone to look at it-$2.7 million. Then I went to Judy Green's party at 555 Park. Arlene Francis was there and her little husband Martin Gabel who is still alive who she has to push around like a toy.

It was thrilling. A reproduction of a building they have not excavated yet in Italy-they know where it is but there is another building on top of it. Bought a book on painting ($17). Bob arrived in L.A. and described the YSL Opium party for us. Then Joan Quinn arrived in fuschia hair and lots of matching amethysts. Fiorucci sent a limo in exchange for us going to their opening. We went to pick up Ursula Andress first. she is staying with Linda Evans. The house is very big English country-style a pool and tennis courts. Ursula was wearing a YSL scarf over the cast on her broken arm. She was surfing in Malibu with Ryan O'Neal when Hurricane Norman hit her and broke her arm tore it out of her socket. Joan whispered that everyone in L.A. wonders if it was Hurricane Ryan that actually did it. We went to Fiorucci where we ran into Ronnie Levin with Susan Pile and Tere Tereba. Susan screamed that the party was cancelled but we thought that was just a joke and started to get out of the limo but a cop pushed us back in and said we were blocking traffic that the party was cancelled by order of the Beverly Hills Fire Department. A transvestite handed us business cards through the window. Then we went back to the hotel and then I went with Sue Mengers and everyone else waited around for Mick Jagger to call. Sue is really fat again. And God her attitude is so cheap. There was no dinner so she suggested we stop at Burger King on the way to Diana Ross. It was so abstract you talk into a machine. She ordered a double Whopper but then she worried that maybe two separate hamburgers would have been cheaper. Sue treated the driver like dirt and I know that if I ever said one little remark to her that she did not like she would never speak to me again. She said she would introduced Isabella Rossellini to Martin Scorsese and that they have been living together for two months. She hates Jerry Hall because Jerry told Bob Weiner that Sue wanted to take an acid trip with Timothy Leary. ""What do they think I amww."" Like it had ruined her reputation. So vulgar. God. Arrived backstage and she said ""I am Miss Ross's agent."" A cute little waiter was serving meatballs. She said ""If we knew there would be meatballs we would not have had to stop at Burger King."" I got myself really drunk drinking straight Stolichnaya. Sue told me she would just been really after John Travolta to represent him but he reminded her that she would turned him down when he was on TV in Welcome Back Kotter and she did not remember it. But then she said sitting on the toilet seat one night she remembered it. Then Diana Ross came out looking really lovely. Thrilled to see me kissed me. Then she went on stage. She had a shot of brandy in her coffee before she went on. We were sitting in the seventh row. Universal Amphitheater. A plane went over with lights on it that said ""Welcome to my show."" Laser beams on the stage. She came out of a big screen down an elegant staircase. Her brother is cute. I want him photographed in Interview. She told me she got the whole idea for her show from the Interview photo of guys carrying her down a staircase. Diana did not say she liked her cover and I just know it is because it made her look too black. At the end of the show she did a Wiz number and she apologized for the music being too slow and said ""Forgive me audience"" which she did not have to say because no one knew the difference. Afterwards backstage Diana started to cry. She wanted to have another rehearsal tomorrow. Then Berry Gordy and Diana had a fight he told her he was not going to spend the money on another rehearsal. Diana wanted Sue to take her side but Sue said it was not her area and then she said to me ""let us get the hell out of here."""

She said she fell asleep with her soft contacts in and ruined her eyes for a while and she can not find her glasses. Joel Grey's daughter Jennifer was there too. When Valentino heard I was going up later to interview Sophia Loren he said that she was the stingiest person that she went to his place and wanted a 70 percent discount and he said goodbye. Cabbed up to the Pierre with Victor and Robert Hayes in rush hour ($4). Went to the thirty-sixth floor to see Sophia. On the way in the cab I warned Victor everything he should not talk about like that we were suing her husband. John Springer met us. Sophia came out looking beautiful. Then she kept telling us how poor she was it was so ridiculous. Like we asked her if she wore Valentino clothes and she said oh no that they were much too expensive for her and she said she would not be able to afford to stay at a place like the Pierre herself-that the movie people were paying for it. Like she did not mention that she could have stayed right down the street in her own apartment in the Hampshire House. But Victor was fun he opened champagne and said he saw all her movies in Venezuela when he was a baby. I would told Victor he could not say any dirty words because when we went to Carlo Ponti's villa in Rome a few years ago they told us that Sophia did not allow any dirty words in her house and that we would get kicked out if we said any. Well the running thing while we were at the Pierre it turned out was that Sophia kept saying ""fuck."" She and Marcello Mastroianni are on the front page of the Post for being on the new Dick Cavett interview show on channel 13 and Marcello said ""You have to fuck a lot"" when Dick asked him how do you be a Latin Lover. Sophia seemed to think that was so ""cute"" so she was repeating it. After about an hour she wanted to get rid of us and we ran out."

When I got to the office Brigid had just had her cat Jimmy put to sleep. And I got so mad and told her how could she have done it when she did not even take it to another doctor for a second opinion. And Rupert had offered to take it to Pennsylvania because sometimes things can just change and the cat can get better but she did not even tell him so he never got the chance. she would been having to shoot it up every day because it had kidney problems and she was afraid it was going to start peeing on her rug. Jimmy was cute. Decided to go to Richard Weisman's party for Catherine Oxenberg's birthday at Le Club. The last time I saw Catherine Oxenberg was at a party in Spain given by Marc Rich and he was in the newspapers yesterday because he owes the government more evaded taxes than anybody in history hundreds of millions or something.

The two of us are more the same kind of person. I mean I have got top family and you have got top family and you are giving an exclusive to that newspaper?' "" Jamie said Ron got really upset and wanted to call off the shoot but Jamie ran out and bought an Interview and Ron read it and it did not look homosexual to him and he said he did not care anyway that he still wanted to be in it because he wanted ""to meet Andy."" And go out to dinner with me. And he turned out to be a really nice kid God he was so sweet. The only trouble was he kept pawing the little girl. He and the girl live together. The Chocolate Boy is just a close friend. And he is very smart. He did not say much but then when he did it was smart. Lispy and cute. And he was sort of sitting there looking bouncy. Then they took pictures and he drank. He drank more than anybody I know I do not know if it was just not to be nervous or what. Then went to do the interview at 65 Irving. I did not know what to talk to him about I was too shy and he was too shy. But then Bob got a little encouraged and started asking about his father. And I asked him (laughs) on Bob's behalf whether his father dyes his hair. He said everybody asks him that question. I blamed it on Bob. Bob then blamed it on me. Ron said no his father does not and that his mother's very sweet and very adorable. So then I got sneaky and brought Ordinary People up and I told him how much I hated Mary Tyler Moore that after I saw the movie if I saw her on the street I would just kick her. And at that point he was almost going to say something about Nancy but then somehow he got the drift of it and changed the subject. Because I think the mother in Ordinary People is just like Mrs. Reagan. Really cold and shrewd. And by the way little Timmy Hutton the star of it turned us down he will not do any interviews. Okay so we are at 65 Irving. I told him I would never had frogs' legs and he was so sweet he ordered them just so I could try it. he is really sweet a beautiful body and beautiful eyes. But he just does not have a pretty nose. it is too long. Big full lips. He does not look like anybody in the family it is surprising. I do not know if he is a fairy. He was sitting there holding his girlfriend's leg touching her. she is twenty-eight years old her name is Doria and they met in California. She invited me over for a Cuisinart dinner-he bought her a Cuisinart for her birthday. And they have a ten-inch television set Quasar. Then outside we ran into Annie Leibovitz and she is gotten over her ""heart attack."" She looked great. I took some Polaroids and gave them to them as souvenirs and I gave them Philosophy books and Exposures. And then little Ron wrote in one to the black friend ""To my favorite nigger"" and the boy said he is going to show it around when he goes to the White House. Then we were talking about Merce Cunningham and Ron said the piece Merce did with the helium pillows was his favorite and I told him that I would made those Silver Pillows and he said that he did not even know that that was not why he would said it. Bob just fell in love with him thought he was so great. Jamie Kabler had a limo and we dropped the Reagan kids off they live on 10th Street between Fifth and Sixth. They had a really good time they really liked us so we will be going off to Cuisinart dinners. Have I said that I lost the bet to Ralph Destino about where Rita Hayworth was born-she was born in Brooklyn and so now I have to do the portrait of the woman he is going to marry."
"Thursday, September 25, 1986","[Martin Burgoyne, Ronnie Levin, Sean Penn]",0.18636363636363634,"Calvin Klein got married to Kelly in Rome. Got to the office and Sam asked about my upcoming dinner that night with Warren and Cher and I just said I could not make it and did he want to go to dinner and a movie and he accepted that. And nobody better tell him. The Beverly Hills police detective in charge of the Ronnie Levin case called Interview looking for PH because he read her Don Johnson interview where Don talks about knowing Ronnie. So she gave him the names of two people he should talk to in L.A. to help prove that Ronnie is not still alive somewhere which is what the ""Billionaire Boys Club"" kids who're on trial for his murder are saying. Called Keith to get Martin Burgoyne's number. I said we really wanted Sean Penn for the cover and Martin offered to talk to him. Cabbed to 52nd Street to meet Sam to see Shanghai Surprise ($5). I was the only one awake in the theater but the movie is not bad. Madonna was beautiful the clothes were great. Sam dropped me (cab $4)."
"Thursday, September 27, 1984","[Dick Tracy, Irving Blum, Keith Haring, Mery Griffin, Robert Redford]",0.07819428046700773,Talked to Keith Haring who said he was depressed so he went to the Whitney and that he saw the Pop Art show and saw my Dick Tracy and loved it and I said it would just been sold for $500000 and he said that was not enough that it was worth a million and that if he would had a million he would have bought it. That was sweet of him to say. And it was sweet to hear. Si Newhouse bought it from Irving Blum. Went to meet the Brants for dinner at Jams (cab $6). I told the guy we wanted to be downstairs but he put us upstairs again but then later I saw why-Robert Redford was right behind me with maybe his wife and daughter I think. I did not say anything because that is not cool but when I got home I happened to read an old Playboy interview with him and then I decided I should have said hello because it turns out he would tried to be a painter at one point and he talked about how he was a magazine art director in the fifties in New York. I did not know any of that! So then he would know about me. Did I tell the Diary by the way that Mery Griffin turned down our TV show? He did.
"Thursday, September 28, 1978",[],-0.28333333333333327,Bob was in a grouchy mood because the doctor told him he could not drink anymore and now he is bored by absolutely everybody he sees he is a camp. He only perks up when there is royalty around. he is as bad as Fred.
"Thursday, September 29, 1977","[Anita Pallenberg, David Whitney, Earl McGrath, Fred Hughes, Freddy Eberstadt, Keith Richards, Kevin Goodspeed, Mick Jagger, Muhammad Ali, Nenna Eberstadt, Peter Marino, Richard Weisman, Rodney La Rod, Ron Wood, Sam Green, Suzie Frankfurt, Tina Radziwill]",0.04826788454161872,"Talked to Fred. We were arranging to go up to meet Nenna Eberstadt who worked at our office all summer for lunch at her school uptown on 83rd Street-Brearley. Before I left the house I happened to talk on the phone to David Whitney. David said he had not even started on the Jasper Johns show. Then he told me something that scared me when I heard it and scared me even more as the day went on. He said that when Rauschenberg was down in Texas for a show all the art people were on a chic art-people charter bus and it stopped at a gas station and the men's room was locked so Rauschenberg peed on the side of the bus and two Texas Rangers appeared and arrested him and took him to jail! I mean if you are walking along the street in New York what if you really have to pee or shit? What do you do? Do you have to do it in your pants? Will they arrest you if you do it in the street? And if you can prove that you really had to go will they let you go but will you have a criminal record? I guess you have to do it in your pants. Cabbed up to Brearley with Bob and Fred. Left from the office so I took a stack of Interviews up with me. When we got to 83rd and First Avenue (cab $5) we walked in and left the magazines at the front for the girls to take. I forgot that this was not all a high-school-age place. I was just thinking that all the girls were older like Nenna. Well Nenna came to meet us and she looked like she was suddenly ten years old! I could not believe it! In a little black uniform and one of those skirts you know that is short like-what is the name? Like the ladies wore in the sixties ... a miniskirt. And her friend was in a uniform too a very beautiful girl who also looked ten years old. And Fred told us a secret that Mick Jagger had called Nenna and Freddy Eberstadt answered and started screaming at him ""How dare you call a young girl like my daughter? You an older man of forty!"" Mick took offense and said ""I am not forty. I am thirty-four. And Nenna goes out with Mr. Fred Hughes who is also thirty-four. And besides I do not go around ringing people's doorbells at 4:00 in the morning."" Which was a reference to Freddy Eberstadt ringing Mick's doorbell at that hour looking for Nenna. As I looked around at how young the girls were all I could think about was the Interviews upstairs and about Rauschenberg getting arrested in Texas and about Roman Polanski how the poor guy could make a mistake because these young girls could be as young or as old as they wanted to look. Tina Radziwill was there at Brearley too. she is changed a lot since that summer Lee rented Montauk. She has so many pimples now. I mean you would think they would have found a way to cure pimples. If a girl like Tina who can spend all the money in the world to get rid of pimples can not get rid of them then there is no hope for me. Nenna introduced us to another one of her girlfriends and she looked forty! She had tits so big and an ass so big. She was white but there were a couple of coloreds around the school too. Then they gave us a terrible tour of the library and the gym and where the twelve-year-olds eat. All I could think of was the magazines with maybe nude photos in them. I had Bob run upstairs to take them back but they were gone. I told Nenna she just had to tell the headmistress that we would just left them there meaning to pick them up on the way out and she said she would try to fix it. Cabbed back to the office ($5). Mick arrived twenty minutes late in a really good mood-I was photographing the Stones. Then everybody started arriving-Ron Wood and Earl McGrath and Keith Richards who I think is just the most adorable person I love him. I told him I was the first person to meet his wife Anita Pallenberg. In the sixties. Richard Weisman was sending down tickets to a party for Ali if Ali won his fight with Shavers. Suzie Frankfurt called. she is been seeing Sam Green all the time and I said to her ""Do you think that Sam Green does not talk about you?"" She said ""No Sam loves me."" I said ""You mean you think he does not go all over town repeating to everybody what you say?"" She said ""But he does not talk about you.'1 I said ""Yes and that is because I never never tell him anything."" Dropped off Catherine and Peter Marino. Peter and Catherine got friendly in Montauk. I can not figure Peter out he is nutty. I told him how he owed his whole life and architecture career to us-how we gave him his first job-took him out of his business knickers and gave him his long pants and he said that well now he was in Armani suits and that we sure did not put him in those. He was funny (cab $4). Changed at home. Ate some of Archie's food then started walking up to 730 Park Avenue to a dinner for a Swiss guy who is in town who said he is been dying to meet me. After dinner I went down to 66th Street to wait for my date Kevin Goodspeed who I would met at Studio 54. he is big and he is like my old crush from the sixties Rodney La Rod and at first I thought he would be a good bodyguard until later in the evening when somebody stepped on his camera and beat him up. Cabbed to the party for Muhammad Ali at the Americana ($2.50). It was one of those parties where you are Waiting for Nothing. Ali never came they said he was too badly hurt in the fight. But one great thing happened. I met a black lady boxer. She invited me to go see her box. Then Richard Weisman wanted to go dancing so we went over to Studio 54. Walked. Stevie Ru-bell is madly in love with me. And Victor was there and got jealous of my date Kevin. Victor was wearing ""punk pants"" and they had a normal fly that was zipped and everything but at the bottom of the zipper was a hole for his cock to hang through and you did not even notice it at first everything looked like it was in order. He was also wearing a sequined Halston bandanna like the kind he gave me. Then Kevin and I went down to Kevin's neighborhood on Third Avenue in the 30s to Sarge's the all-night coffee shop and after we had coffee I left him with some people he knew there. it is supposed to be the best coffee shop (breakfast $10). When I got out on the street a kid in a Mercedes pulled up and said he used to live on my block on 66th Street. I made him describe the street and he did know it so I got into the car and he dropped me off. By then it was 5 A.M."

I ran out and bought flea collars for my ankles. Cabbed downtown ($5) to the new chic supermarket at Park Avenue and 18th Street the Food Emporium but a gay guy there made my sandwiches and so I could not eat them. Kenny Scharf came by he just bought a $2000 house in Bahia and eats coconuts all day. His wife's having a baby. His father must be a semi-rich producer. Kenny met his wife on a plane to Carnival. Then Keith Haring came by after getting a B-12 shot from Dr. Giller and it was like the sixties when the kids would get shot up and come back so bubbly. And Keith was ranting and raving about this black graffiti artist that is in the papers now because the police killed him-Michael Stewart. And Keith said that he is been arrested by the police four times but that because he looks normal they just sort of call him a fairy and let him go. But this kid that was killed he had the Jean Michel Basquiat look-dreadlocks. Worked all afternoon. Dropped Benjamin (cab $7). Glued myself and went over to Engine's alone she was having a party for Julio Iglesias's birthday and Lester Persky was arriving when I was and we went in as a couple and there were cameras but everybody said it was (laughs) just Spanish television. The usual people there ""Suzy"" and Jerry Zipkin and Cornelia. And Julio Iglesias looks different than in pictures. he is 6'3"" and very handsome with a very dark tan and teeth that are practically fluorescent. He was very friendly as if he really knew me. Maybe he knows somebody that we know who talks about us all the time. And Cornelia sat near so she could catch his eye. Halston had called and said to come over to his place afterwards. So I went to Halston's and Jane Holzer was there and Halston was doing the same ""I am so rich"" routine but I mean he must be worried after that thing came out in Fortune where the guy who owns him now said he was thinking of selling him. Oh and Halston asked again about meeting Jerry Hall. He still wants to make Bianca jealous. But now that Jerry's pregnant it will be hard to dress her."

Lunch for Hermann. Brigid was trying to call Viva to find out if she would known that Johanna Lawrenson had been living with Abbie Hoffman. Brigid was thrilled it was the return of the sixties. Abbie Hoffman looks horrible he does not look any different even though they say he had plastic surgery. And his wife just slapped him with alimony and child-support charges. Ron Feldman called and said the Miami trip was going to be so exciting that I was going to get three keys to the city. It sounds scary.

About the scratch. One of those days. Worked till 8:00. Took Wilfredo and Sam with me to dinner at Castellano with Philip Johnson and David Whitney. David was not drinking so he was reserved. Philip was thrilled with the young kids. We walked back to Philip and David's apartment and they invited us up it was the first time they were having people and some kids were coming out of the building as we were going in and they yelled dirty things like ""you are going up to fuck."" It was great up there my Cow wallpaper in the bathroom. And it is kind of great their life eating at the same restaurant every night. Then we went downtown to the benefit for Martin Burgoyne at the Pyramid on Avenue A (cab $8 admission $30). Martin gave us big kisses and that threw me for a loop. Stayed five minutes. Madonna had been there and left."

And a black girl said she would show us to our seats and she took us down an aisle and had me sign something and then left us standing there and then I realized she had just wanted an autograph that she was not even an usher. That was funny. But I mean she could have taken us down the right aisle anyway. So we found our seats and Eddie Murphy they said was somewhere but I did not see him. So Luther sang and his songs were all long long stories. But very good the audience loved him. Then we cabbed to Area ($7). And Lester Persky was there drunk kissing everybody saying how I would picked him out of the gutter and made him somebody and (laughs) I guess I have told him that so often that he is started to believe it. And he wanted to meet Boy George so he had me introduce him and then when I left them alone I guess Boy George lost interest because Lester came over and wanted to be reintroduced. And Lester's friend Tommy Dean was there who I just can not stand. I remember when he told Lester not to give us the money to make Bad. And he did it so smugly. Oh I remember that. So smug. Benjamin walked me to a cab and I went uptown ($8).

I guess it rained all night that is what must have gotten me up in the middle of the night. Went out and passed out Interviews. On the street I ran into David Kennerly the White House photographer he was in town to promote a book he said. Only I did not recognize him at first then finally he said something about the White House and it was able to dawn on me who he was. Walked down a little ways and wandered into all the usual places. The hurricane never really happened. It stopped raining. The trees in the park were sort of down but not much. And the headlines are about David Kennedy going to Harlem to buy drugs. he is the crazy one who had the fight with Fred at Xenon. It was cute when he said to the police ""I am David Kennedy please do not tell my family I just want to go to Hyannis."""

Met Catherine at La Folie for the Joan Fontaine book party (cab $4). I introduced her as the new senior Viva editor and what a difference that made. Everybody was suddenly ""Oh right this way-oh here you go"" and they really hustled. She was Miss Big. I dropped Catherine off and near 63rd Street we ran into her new editor the girl who hired her and (laughs) she is so thrilled to be getting Catherine. Bob got a car and we picked up Fred and went out to Alex Guest's party for his sister Cornelia who is going off to Foxcroft. There was a girl there named Lisa Rance who is after Robyn Geddes but she is chubby and I told her. She was wearing a white Valentino and some kid came and threw ""invisible ink"" on it and it did disappear but I will bet it is not really gone that in a different light you can still see it. I think the dress is finished."

Lucio picked us up and took us to the gallery because we had a press conference with 400 people. Joseph Beuys loves the press now because he is running for president of Germany under the Free Sky Party and with me he can get more coverage-no it is the Green Party that is it. Then Sao Schlumberger arrived and we invited her to lunch at this waterfront place. Then we were picked up for the opening and there were at least 3000 or 4000 people there you could not get in it was horrible and finally we slipped away they were giving us a party at a place called something like City Hall a drag nightclub. Finally after three hours of waiting this drag queen with hair on his chest came in and I was talking so she told me to shut up she did a couple of numbers and then all of a sudden pushed me aside and stormed out and we did not understand what had happened but somebody said she was too emotional because she was singing for me she gets that way. But it was too boring. Fred got insulted because the TV lights were shining on us too long and told Lucio off that it was the most ridiculous evening and that Lucio had wasted our time because that kind of evening would not sell pictures and that he was just using us to get into show business. We did not get into bed till about 4:00.

And the whole thing was so nelly not one good thing. you would like to think that a big brute movie star would have had great fifties stuff like maybe big rugged Knoll pieces but it was just comfortable nelly junk from his New York apartment. There was only one sort of nice thing a wooden box that was so ugly and Elizabeth Taylor had written on it. Fran Lebowitz came by to pick up some art that Bob Colacello promised her when she was writing for Interview. She came in her beige Marathon Checker cab and she drove off with it.

The place was jammed. Allen Ginsberg gave me a big kiss he was with Peter Orlovsky. We had good seats. Everybody loved the show. Blues could really be big now. The black blues guys are such gorgeous dressers-hats and beautiful clothes and gold teeth that you can really see and jewelry and they just let people do things for them. They must be really big stars. Curley was obnoxious-he called some boy to come and meet him so I got mad and I am never going to take him anywhere again. he is just a rich freeloader.
"Tuesday, April 10, 1984","[Fred Leighton, Jack Hofsiss, Jean Michel Basquiat, Jody Powell, John Cage, John Reinhold, Linda Li, Lou Adler, Merce Cunningham, Richard Pryor, Robert Hayes, Sam Havadtoy, Timothy Hutton, Walter Cronkite]",0.08961018411967782,"Benjamin picked me up and we went over to Sotheby's. And there was only one thing I wanted. Anything with any style will end up at Fred Leighton's. There was a Verdura pin of a big black Negro's face with cabochon ruby eyes and lots of stones. Jean Michel Basquiat called me twice this morning from L.A. and would not speak when I answered because he did not think it was me. Then on the third time he did and he told me that he would been at the Roxy Lou Adler's place ""with Jack and Shirley and Debra and Warren and Richard Pryor and Timothy Hutton."" Just about thirty people. And then there were parties at Morton's and Spago and he got home at 5:00 so he felt like a movie star. Dr. Karen came to the office and she decided to set up an office at the office so that was fun. I made an appointment to see a nutritionist. Dr. Linda Li on the West Side. Gael Love called a few times. Robert Hayes has been out with a cold for three weeks and somebody put a bug in my head like ""what is wrong with Robert?"" But Gael said ""No no it is nothing like that."" Went to pick up John Reinhold to take him to Yoko's black-tie birthday dinner for Vasarely's (cab $4). So we went to the Dakota and had to leave our shoes in the hallway. She had lots of pretty boys as waiters. I could not tell which one was Sam Havadtoy. Her live-in love. he is a decorator. And it was very chic. We ate in the kitchen it was fresh vegetables and pasta and maybe something like veal. I could not recognize anybody but everybody was somebody. John Cage was there and Merce Cunningham. And little Sean Lennon fell in love with me just madly. He said ""Why is your hair like that?"" I said ""Punk."" He said ""what is your name?"" I said ""Adam."" Then I asked him to get me a double champagne and when he came back with it he said somebody had told him I was Andy Warhol and then he went around to everyone telling them ""Do you know who that is? that is Andy Warhol."" And I did my old trick I tore a dollar bill in half for him. And he said ""You have to give me an autograph"" and so I signed ""To Sean Andy."" And he said ""I am not interested in your first name I want your last one."" And I told him that I was not so famous at all that the other people were there really famous like John Cage and that he should get his autograph. So he did and John signed the most beautiful signature. And then Sean had him sign a ""J"" and then he came over and ripped the ""J"" in half and gave me half. But John had done it on the back of the really beautiful signature so that was ruined-Sean could have had a beautiful John Cage autograph. Oh and when I was cleaning at home just the other week out of a drawer fell pictures of John and Yoko that I would taken in the sixties or early seventies and two of the photographs were double exposures of their faces and it killed me to give one of those up but I did. The one where you could tell them apart I gave to her and the one where the features were all together I kept. When could I have taken those photos? let us see... I was going around town with John and Yoko when I was looking to buy a building downtown so it was before I got the Bowery place which was around '69 and there were three buildings on Greene Street each for $200000 that were all being sold together and Yoko was going to buy one and John was going to buy one and I was going to buy one. But then Yoko got greedy and wanted all three. And then they wound up not buying any of them. But by then I would been pushed out of the picture. And that building would be worth millions today. I think that was the year she had that show in upstate New York where she flew everybody up there on one of those creaky airlines like One-Way Air or something. She spent $25000 to fly everybody up there but then she did not have any other freebie for them-no food or anything. Just up there. And there was an ""in"" party and an ""out"" party that kind of stuff. What year was that in? I can not remember if it was before I was shot or after. It could have been '67 or '68 or '69 or '71. I just do not know. What makes me think it was before I got shot was that it was just me who went up there and I think if it was after I was shot then Jed would have come too. Dinner was served and I sat next to Walter Cronkite and Sean and I told Sean that if he wanted to be a host he should get us food. And I had him take pictures for me of all the shoes lined up in the hallway. And Sean had the flu and the girl next to Walter Cronkite had the flu and so I was being coughed on so I just know I will get it. I talked to Walter Cronkite and that was interesting. I told him I would just read the Jody Powell thing in Rolling Stone. He said he thought Carter was the most intelligent president. And he said that years ago when he went to interview Nixon one of those times he was running for president they sat him outside the door and he heard Nixon on the phone saying ""piss"" and ""cocksucker"" and ""fuck"" and Walter Cronkite thought it was a setup to have him hear all this so he would think Nixon was really macho but then years later when the Watergate tapes came out he was surprised to hear Nixon talking like that all the time. And then I heard Sean talking to this guy and asking what his name was and he said ""Coppola"" so then I told him how much I loved The Outsiders and Rumble Fish. And we talked about how he had so many great kids in those two movies that it was like American Graffiti-all the kids would become the next generation of big stars. And I did not know Coppola was from New York. He said he went to Hofstra and I said that we would done a lecture there once with Viva. And he said that his little girls miss me I met them in Colorado skiing. He was with his wife who did not say anything. And then Sean saw that I had bluejeans on and he started saying ""you are the only real person here you are so cool you are so cool."" he is so cute. And one of the waiters was somebody I would discovered for Interview and he would had a whole page as a bright young new star he was in Jack Hofsiss's play and he went to L.A. for a year and now he is back and being a waiter-it was really sad. I forget his name although he told me again last night. From Georgia. Something like Bruce maybe. I dropped John Reinhold (cab $6). Got home at 12:30. Decided to read the Daily News and got to bed at 2:00. And Yoko looks really good."

Gene Shalit thinks she is hysterical. And then Averil Meyer came to the office because she wanted to meet Ruth Carter Stapleton who was coming with Dotson Rader at 3:00 (cab $4). But they did not get there until 4:00. Brigid was offended that Dotson said ""fuck"" and ""shit"" in front of Ruth and she said ""there is nothing left to respect in life if he can say that in front of the president's sister. It just shows you that Nixon should be back in the White House."" And Ruth Carter Stapleton was sweet and Dotson was disgusting as usual. She wanted a Polaroid of us and naturally there were not any bulbs so Ronnie went out to get some and Vincent took a Polarvision movie and showed it and that was the entertainment. I gave her a Bad T-shirt. And the guy from the hamburger place came by. I am doing a portrait of a hamburger Frank Fowler got me the job. I can not remember the name. Not McDonald's not Burger King not Wendy's not Wetsons-something else. Toni the girl I met from High Times magazine and her girlfriend Carole were picking me up in a limo at 8:30. So I waited until 10:00 and finally they arrived then we picked up Brigid. I wanted to tape them and see if I could make a play out of it. Toni was wearing a T-shirt of two guys making it. Well we went down to 10th Street between First and Second to Princess Pamela's restaurant something like that. Carole was in a fur coat. We rang the doorbell and Princess Pamela answered a colored lady in a bright red wig. She looked like a drag queen so you get the idea. they would expected us at 8:30. Well we went up the stairs to the second floor and there was nobody else in the place but two Negro girls waitresses-entertainers. It was three little rooms and a white piano in one room. And the two girls were about thirty-five and sort of intelligent but like black Valerie Solanises. It was a restaurant with readings in between courses. The place started out fifteen years ago and Craig Claiborne gave it a couple of stars in 1966 when it was on the ground floor. And they had pictures of Norman Norell on the wall and he is dead already of throat cancer probably from eating there. I thought I heard her say something about Idi Amin flying over from Paris once for a party at her place but I do not know that I may have heard wrong. Toni and Carole-all they talk about is 1966. I kept asking them what happened between '70 and '75 and they were off drugs I guess so they said ""Nothing."" The princess put on a gown and was singing and she brought in a 2' X 1' peach cobbler made out of a canned peach and it was so sad because nobody had been there it was not even cut into. She said ""I made it just for you."" And I did not want to eat it so to make it look used I put it on Brigid's plate and Brigid gave me one of her mean ""Honey"" looks like her mother Honey gives her and said how dare I. And the princess had a brochure about the place that had something about Joe Franklin in it. Brigid was just in love with the place you know how overboard she goes. she is going to start going there all the time. And then I could not take it anymore I just had to leave so I went downstairs. Toni paid the bill."

I am trying to think of ideas how to do ""Rolling Stones"" one of those little plastic games where you have to roll the stones into the holes. Victor called and said that it was getting too heavy at Halston's and that he was moving into the loft on 19th and 5th renting with an option to buy. Until he moves in in May he will be sleeping around he said."
"Tuesday, April 12, 1983",[Ron Feldman],0.14289772727272726,Everyone was calling because the Village Voice ran a three-page putdown of my wig. It was a writeup of the Studio 54 party for our TV show. I was being picked up at 4:00 by Ron Feldman and his wife in a limo to go up to the Museum of Natural History for my Endangered Species opening. So they picked me up and she was wearing plastic jewelry the kind I collected years ago. Rupert is getting tanner and tanner every day. Instead of working he is going to the tanning places. There was a crowd in front of the museum when we got there and I thought it was for me but they were filming a Disney movie. And then later when we were coming out the movie people were chasing a big rat that had gotten into one of the actors' trailers. Originally they were going to have my show in the lobby but then they put it way back so you had to go through the rooms of dinosaurs and finally get to this little room where I was. But it looked great really beautiful. White-framed.
"Tuesday, April 14, 1981","[Jon Gould, Jonathan Roberts, Katy Dobbs, Lady McCrady]",0.03125,Worked till 5:30. Jon Gould invited me to a screening of Atlantic City that he was giving for his crowd. Cabbed to Paramount ($7). Lady McCrady and Jonathan Roberts were there and Katy Dobbs who was also in that Radcliffe publishing course that all those kids took. And I ran into a guy who'd seen my picture in the Zoli book and offered me a job. Fred is still furious he said I should be getting thousands for endorsing products not working for modeling fees. But I think it is funny to be just another pretty face in the Zoli book. I told him to lighten up.

Went with Henry Geldzahler to the Village where the Women's House of Detention was which is now a locked-up park. The trees there were just perfect to photograph for the poster. I gave an Interview to the lady with the key to the garden. Then Henry left me in the Village and I was stopped by a kid who said he grew up in the foster home with Joe and Bobby Dallesandro and he said he was really good friends with Bobby. So I had to tell him Bobby committed suicide and he was just stunned. I left him there on the street being shocked. Back at the office Bob was in a bad mood. I dropped him off (cab $5.50). Glued myself together picked up Catherine and cabbed to Bill Copley's place. Bill's secretary told me that Bill left Tommy the dog who was the sweetest thing at the party out on the terrace by mistake on the coldest day of the year and somebody saw him out there and called the police who had to come and get him off. I said I wanted to take Tommy home with me and Bill might let me have him he is thinking about it. Clarisse Rivers was there just back from Mexico and Vincent and Shelly and Michael Heizer. And Christophe de Menil was with Viva's ex-husband Michel Auder-she goes after the worst people. She looked beautiful like one of those old-fashioned prints. Her hair was up and she has a tiny body.
"Tuesday, April 15, 1986",[Johnny Carson],0.22036380286380286,"-Paris We were going to do live TV on this very famous Johnny Carson-type show. When we got there they were setting up. All of a sudden they heard about Libya being bombed so the main guy had to leave and he left some lady there so then they were not interested in me anymore but they had to pretend to still be and I do not know if they were really doing it or just going through the motions. I think they just faked it. They did not even ask me anything and it sounded like they just made it up. They said they put it on tape but I do not think they did (cab $10 $5). Went to an Arab restaurant or Libyan one of those kinds of restaurants in the rich area near YSL. It was fun started to rain more. Couscous (lunch $75). We had dinner with Billy Boy and all the people from the gallery and it was like a twenty-course dinner and Billy Boy said he was a health-food person that he did not drink but there he was drinking right in front of me while he was telling me. He ate meat while he told me he did not too. He was great company because all you had to do was say ""Barbie"" and he just talked away and that solved everything nobody had to worry about conversation. We had a good time and then Chris went off with Billy Boy and did the nightclub scene."

We thought they would have a limousine because there were twelve of them but then we had to get three cabs down to the Village. They wanted to pay for the cab but I did ($6). We met on Christopher and Bleecker and then went to a used-clothes store and they had a good time. Mork can tell in a second what will fit him. He picked out three suits and he put them on and they fit perfectly. His wife's name is Valerie and she is really nice. She said she would been down to Bleecker Street already that morning and gotten French provincial furniture that morning to send back to L.A. We went though the back streets and it is funny-when kids see Robin they just say ""Hi Mork"" without getting excited it is like seeing somebody they know. it is the grownups who get excited. We walked over to Lady Astor's. Then we went to meet Michael Sklar who I have not seen in years who was in our movies Trash and L'Amour. He looks thin in the face. he is a friend of theirs. Robin's going to do the Popeye movie. Sue Mengers just became his agent. Valerie said that when she saw Robin was going to get famous and they would been living together for two years she told him she did not want to go through life and the newspapers as Robin Williams and Guest so she made him marry her. they are nice and they are (laughs) ""real."" You know? So they do not have limousines. But a limousine would have been so much easier. Did I tell the Diary about Henry Post's bad accident? He was driving his new car out to Southampton and he woke up in the hospital. He does not remember a thing. He hit two poles. And then I slipped and said something dumb-which I should not have because when you are on pills and painkillers and things you get paranoid-I said ""Maybe because of the exposes you write maybe somebody sabotaged you."""

Took pictures of the street people of about eight artists who were doing portraits of people on the street. And there was a black ventriloquist with a crowd around him so I stuck my camera up to get the picture but the dummy saw me and yelled my name and then everybody turned around and I had to sign autographs. Took pictures of a couple of preachers too. Stopped at a Japanese place just to get some nourishment and the waitress could not speak English but she wanted my autograph. So I guess my commercial's still running in Japan ($75). We had drinks my first time in weeks so that made life more bearable. And called John Reinhold. The 860 office said that Jean Michel Basquiat was waiting there but I went to the new office and since I was high I terrorized everybody. Walked down to 860 and as we passed the new chic food place on 23rd Street a couple of black truck drivers yelled ""Hey faggots!"" so that got me down. Especially because truck drivers are usually the ones who're cheerful and recognize me and wave. Maybe these were faggots themselves. Got to the office and called Jean Michel Basquiat and he came up and painted over a painting that I did and I do not know if it got better or not. Dropped Benjamin ($6). Glued myself and cabbed to a dinner at Club A ($4). I was at a heavy-duty table next to Diane Von Furstenberg who is having Michael Graves do her new store that is next to Vieille Russie. And I told her not to count on a May opening I told her how long it took Michael Graves to do John Reinhold's apartment and I said he would probably take her little store and divide it into fifteen rooms with forty columns in each and then she got scared. And she talked about a party she was giving for Michael Graves but she did not invite me."
"Tuesday, April 18, 1978",[],0.03649054318697176,I finally got a BMW painted black with pink roll-on flowers. Maybe they will read meaning into it. I hope so. Some kids from Alabama brought me up some of the Space Dust candy that was on the front page of the Post today. It explodes and crackles inside your mouth. I talked to a lady who said she goes to hospitals and makes flower arrangements for cancer patients and I told her I would like to too. I would not like to though. I was going to ask her was not she afraid she would catch cancer but I do not know maybe a little bit of flowers does make a dif- Oh I do not know. Flowers would not make me feel better if I were a patient. Only that you would know that on a certain day a person was coming in to do the flower. is not it funny that they can cure diseases and still not know what causes them? Like they cured polio but they still do not know how you get it. And all those kids dying in New Jersey of cancer. I guess it is the water.

And I know they meant AIDS and it was too scary and she said ""Oh they just meant flu."" But I am sure they did not. And then Marsia Trinder was there and she is finally married to Lenny Holzer and she said ""Oh do not get near me I just had a baby."" I said ""Marsia you know I mean ..."""

Worked all day had a scene with Tom Bosley. Got done pretty early then went to a big signing of Interviews at a bar called Nippers in the Rodeo Mall and it was jammed. I sat upstairs and signed and signed. And Fred was downstairs and he started drinking and continued drinking I do not know why. Some people brought old issues for me to sign-like from the first year-the Helmut Berger Damned one and the Elvis one and the Raquel Welch one. And actually I think they were ruining them to have me sign them. And John Stockwell/Samuels was there looking really good and he was just in from North Carolina where he was shooting a miniseries North and South with Liz Taylor. It was just mobbed with people. Lots of young kids did not know many of them. Molly Ringwald came. Lots of champagne. And then went back to the Bel Air with PH who was keeping me company because I was depressed. Jon went back to New York I guess he did not want to be linked with me in L.A. He never gave me keys to his new house so I guess I will never be staying there and I am ... Oh I do not know. Life is interesting I guess.

Then they went out and the producer came back and said he would left Fassbinder in a porno shop in the Village. he is strange Fassbinder. He was nice when I introduced him to the boys at the office but when I introduced him to Lidija the exercise teacher he was peculiar. I called Edmund Gaultney because Calvin Klein had asked me to get in touch with Georgia O'Keeffe because he wanted to meet her and buy a painting. And then I called Juan Hamilton and he was being grand he said that Calvin could fly to Albuquerque but he did not know if Georgia would see him and I said that Calvin did not do things like that and he said ""that is how it goes."" So I called Calvin and told him that he should call Juan himself because really it is all personality."

And I was thinking about it: If I had a little kid and she was murdered I would go out and kill the person myself even if I landed in jail. I would do that. I am sure of it. it is just incredible that they do not have any clues at all in twenty-five murders. Brigid had invited Rod McKuen to lunch he used to sleep on her sofa when he was broke. He just moved to town and he called her up. She went to Balducci's and was really putting on the dog. So we sat there and had lunch and gee I tried to figure out what was fascinating about him why he is so big and I just could not. And John Wallowitch called. I raved to him about seeing him playing the piano on cable TV and I told him to come to the office. He was calling to tell me that his brother Eddie my first boyfriend about twenty-five years ago-that he just went down to Florida to visit Eddie and found him bloated and dead in his house. he would been drinking gone off A.A. and had a fit. He always got depressed and I never knew why because he was good-looking and he was a photographer. John did not want to look at the body so a friend came over and identified it. I went to Ashton Hawkins's dinner at 17 East 89th Street my old neighborhood so it made me feel funny. The real how do you-doody heavy duties were there-Brooke Astor Laurance Rockefeller Alice Arlen. And Mike Nichols's hair I do not think it is fake it looks so great so really great. Ashton had a rent-a-maid one of those old Irish types like from Schrafft's the cute Irish ladies with the dykey Vassar haircuts in black uniforms and white collars. Brooke Astor said she was trying to save the South Bronx-the old people and the poor people. Mary McFadden was there with her escort Stephen Paley and I made believe Bob had not told me anything about her divorce about the guy stealing all her stuff. I said ""You look pretty"" and she said ""I am desperate."" I told her to just go out and buy herself a new Yves Saint Laurent dress and she started to hit me and she is strong. Then I asked her if she wanted to arm wrestle and we did and then she started to like me and that got strange. I felt bad because I think I hurt her hand. Went home. I called Jon Gould at the Beverly Wilshire. Then I went to bed and had the most un-sleepful night. Woke up at 3:00 and had a big glass of brandy and a Valium."

I had to give them a tour around the place. I had to leave early to make the 6:30 Martha Graham thing (cab $6). We got there and Martha was making her speech like she always does for an hour first. She wants to be an actress. Nureyev was terrible he just does not know how to be a modern dancer.

I decided to make it a portrait not a drawing just because it was easier. She was hard to do. She has good eyes but her jaw was difficult. She was thrilled I guess. Grace Jones called with laryngitis and I said that maybe I would rent a plane for the Schwarzenegger wedding on Saturday so maybe we will go up together.

Linda Li with her secret powers it is all too crazy. And I can see why these Chinese women make out. it is all sex. She puts her hand on her cunt and pokes me in the gut through to the other side and throws my whole body around. She said she is never dropped a patient but I could have been the first. She has control over your body. she is not bad-looking. So I was there for a half-hour being tossed around. Then phone calls ($.50). Jay's still cheerful so I guess his affair with Kate is still okay. I went over to Yanna's for further beautification. I went past the cops at the Police Academy and the girl cops are cute they are not like dykes now.

Chris Makos called about me being interviewed by a psychiatrist who is doing a book on IQs and I said I would not do it unless I got paid and he called back and said ""$1000"" and I asked Fred and Fred said it sounded like fun so then I said okay. The Ungaro party was at Doubles. Then dinner-Quo Vadis-Margaret was being so sweet she was gossiping and saying that she knew (laughs) she could tell me anything because I would not tell anybody. She said that Pierre Trudeau was in town and that she would introduced him to Lacey Neuhaus and she was thrilled that they would hit it off. And Margaret is so in love with Tom Sullivan. They were just in Georgia and she said that Tom was riding so fast on a horse that she had to hide behind a tree and close her eyes that it was the fastest she is ever seen anyone go.

I decided that I really had to help keep the marriage together so I invited them out to dinner. Worked all afternoon. Went to the Coach House and it is so fattening there-corn sticks and things it is so good. I am 120 now but I would like to get back down I do not think I will see 115 again. I am not anorexic anymore but I want to be. Lidija says it is muscles making me heavier. I mean you see these kids who have been working out for a year or so like Marc Balet who once had a slight hourglass figure and now it looks like he is put on a coat! it is so strange (dinner $250).

Bianca figured out that John Samuels was out at Averil's in Manhasset. She put it together and then I confirmed it. She said that Averil always gets her leftovers that it is so predictable.

Keith called and said he was picking me up at 6:00 for the AIDS benefit that Calvin was giving at the Javits Center where they were going to take a huge picture-done in sections-with Liz Taylor there and lots of celebrities. Got to the center there were 100 students from F.I.T. and Parsons. The place is huge and then it snakes around. Liz Taylor was late because she was getting a dress from Calvin. And the little boy from Indiana was there who they say has AIDS so they will not let him go to school. He was really cute. Brooke Shields was there looking so glamorous. she is the most beautiful living breathing doll I have ever seen. And I always thought Cornelia was beautiful but when she stood next to Brooke she looked like an ugly duckling everything was wrong and she was saying things sort of to Brooke but under her breath like ""Get away!"" She did not want to stand near her-she knew. The mayor finally arrived and got in the center and Liz had not shown yet. It was supposed to be a shot of her and Calvin and the mayor. I was talking to a kid and then he said he was an AIDS patient and you do not know what to say-""Gee what a great party?"" And then you looked and there were spots and that was back to reality. Then Liz came in and everybody went crazy and mobbed her and Keith said ""What do you have to do to be that famous?"" And then they dragged her across the room and then all the photographers rushed at her and smothered her and crushed her and when they had used her up they just dumped her and she was left standing there alone they would gotten what they wanted. It was so strange to see. Jumped in the limo and went to Mr. Chow's and said hello to all the people we would just said goodbye to.

Got there at 11:05 and there was Bob Colacello standing there looking preppie. His clothes are always perfect and immaculate I do not know how he does it. Calvin's girls were meaty-small waists and big hips that was the new look. Went to Sotheby's. Ran into Patricia Neal in the elevator and I asked her if she was still seeing Barry Landau and she said yes so I did not put him down. She was selling a Bacon and she was upset with the low reserve she said-$250000. I guess she needs the money. She said they sold another Bacon to send the son to baking school which she said was a waste because he does not bake. She was walking with a cane. She looks great. Ran into John Richardson and I began asking him about Andrew Crispo and then the TV cameras were around us so we did not want them to know what we were talking about so I began calling Crispo ""her"" and John got it right away. He said ""I never knew her really well I just thought she was a sleazebag."" And John was talking about the Hellfire Club and I am surprised I have never been there I am surprised I never wound up there some night. But I can not stand the smells of those places-even the preppie Surf Club is tough to take. I got catalogues and the painting I did of Happy Rockefeller an early one from '64 was up for sale. it is estimated at $30000 or $40000 and if she would donated it to one of the museums she could have gotten a $500000 writeoff because of the new prices so I do not know why she is selling it. Maybe it is the kids. She sold that Nelson Rockefeller one too months ago. And it is Fashion Week and all around town everyone's just a beauty it is so depressing. Oh and Victor called me and I said he does not come to visit and he said he will start coming tomorrow. He lives on 57th Street-he is with somebody he will always get by he still has his big dick. And I do not know why Interview is having all these Bruce Weber editorial photos of naked people. I mean all those pages with no clothes-no fashion credits?! what is the point? I do not get it! We have advertisers to think about. I am going to lay down the law: ""No more birthday suits."""

There was only one mention in the papers about the party in Earl Wilson's column. And it did not even mention Polaroid. I think all those Polaroid guys are going to get fired there for spending $30000 on a party like that. And Interview will probably lose all their ads. Swifty Lazar's Oscar party got all the big mentions. Bob should have made sure Liz Smith was invited and Rex Reed. And now that I am thinking about it I bet the reason all the society people did not show up was because it was given by Truman! they are probably all mad still at him. I went home and glued and Barbara Allen called and said she did not have anyone to go to the screening of Louis Malle's movie Pretty Baby with so she picked me up at 7:45. We cabbed to the Paramount building in Columbus Circle ($2.50). The screening was a lot of well-to-do famous people. Frank Yablans thanked me for all the nice things he heard I would said about his movie The Other Side of Midnight but I was only kidding. Brooke Shields was there and Mariel Hemingway. Barbara met Baryshnikov and had him sit next to her and she dropped me for him. She asked me ""what are you doing later?"" And when I said going home she said (laughs) ""Great."" It was a cute idea for a movie but nothing comes off-like they had pickets picketing against the sin in New Orleans but nothing happened because of it. Afterwards a friend of Louis Malle's came up and said that Louis really wanted to know what I thought and I said it was ""wonderful"" ""interesting"" ""strange."" Then we had an exciting elevator ride down because it was Baryshnikov Barbara Milos Forman Frank Yablans Diane Von Furstenberg. And Milos was peeking under Baryshnikov's jacket-""looking for the little girl."" And Baryshnikov has such a great body but his hair is so funny. He wears it puffy one of those bubble hairdos. He should get a haircut that makes him look more masculine with his good Russian face."

Her face is so beautiful but she got really fat her behind is so big-as fat as Brigid's was. she is on Easter vacation from Radcliffe. She was the first person to leave I think she has to be home before midnight on a schedule because once when she was at Fred's she stayed until 4:00 and Jackie got mad. The dinner was to say goodbye to Erskine Guinness and his cousin Miranda they are leaving for Ireland."
"Tuesday, April 5, 1983",[Bess Myerson],0.0628066378066378,"Benjamin picked me up and we went over to Columbus Circle to the Coliseum for the Art Expo to do an appearance with the mayor for the signing of the Brooklyn Bridge posters for the city. And it is such a different crowd of people at these things. The photographers they send are different and the people from Time are different-it is just a whole other league. I guess we are just spoiled more sophisticated you do not realize these other ways. And everything's so organized every last move. ""Mayor walks in. Mayor sits down. Mayor presents award""-everything is planned out. Henry's not working for the city now but he was there. Bess Myerson took his place she is the new cultural affairs commissioner. I asked Jon if he wanted to see a screening and he said no that he was going off to a class. I do not know what kind of class. He starts them and he drops them. Writing maybe."
"Tuesday, April 8, 1980","[Hugh Downs, Karen Lerner]",0.12305194805194802,"Rupert came in and we worked on the Jewish Geniuses. Truman called and he sounded like his old self he said he would been working hard. He said that his Chameleon book is going to be in the Book-of-the-Month Club and I asked him how you got that and he said (laughs) from being a good writer. Karen Lerner called and said that Hugh Downs was going to do an update on the 20/20 story and that it was for sure going to run this Thursday. She thinks it is going to be thirteen minutes and I am just so scared I just think our whole business is going to fall apart after that kind of big network exposure. that is what I have really come to decide. I watched the Today Show where there was a forty-seven-year-old black man who was a boxer and then became a dentist for seventeen years and now he is decided he is going to be a boxer again and it was such an up story. I bought some garlic pills because I just read a book that said garlic is against sickness and I believe that it seems right. Forgot to say that at a cocktail party the other night a woman came over and kissed me on the lips and then said ""I am so sick I am dying."" Why do people do that? Are they trying to pass their disease on to somebody so they will not have it anymore?"
"Tuesday, April 8, 1986",[Maria Shriver],0.0,Worked till 8:00. I have to have the Maria Shriver thing done soon. I guess I can not go to her wedding because they will not let me bring anybody. And I would have to stay in Boston and then go alone to Hyannis. Fred was not invited. He was not even invited to Caroline's. I think hers is before Maria's.
"Tuesday, August 10, 1982",[],-0.2,Wandered around the East Village and that made me feel weird. it is picking up again the places were lighted. Gem Spa is still there. I thought about the fifties when I lived on St. Mark's Place and then about the sixties when we ran the Dom discotheque there with the Velvets and Nico playing and about going to all those psychedelic things at the Fillmore and eating at Ratner's delicatessen and everything. It was nostalgic.
"Tuesday, August 11, 1981",[Diana Ross],-0.07606837606837608,Got my live-in contacts but I can not read or draw in them. Do they have bifocals you can wear with contacts? it is so scary to wake up in the middle of the night and be able to see. Walked partway to the office (cab $3.50). I painted some backgrounds for the Diana Ross portrait-I wonder what color I should make her-I wonder if she wants to be black or white. Then I went up to the Con Ed building that is for sale on Madison and it turns out there is three entrances-one on Madison one on 32nd and one on 33rd. It makes a T shape in the middle of the block. There was a bum with no shoes sweeping up the sidewalk. They all hang around there I guess because nobody chases them away. We could not get the doors open though so we went to 22nd Street and Sixth Avenue to look at another building. That one is $1.9. Then we went back to the office. In the awful heat.
"Tuesday, August 12, 1980","[Burt Reynolds, Debbie Harry, Fran Lebowitz, James Ivory, Linda Stein, Lisa Robinson, Margaret Hamilton, Richard Weisman, Sean Young]",0.03688610240334377,At 12:00 I had an appointment to meet Debbie Harry at the office (cab $4). I was early and Debbie and Chris were on time. We worked all afternoon. Debbie was sweet every picture came out perfect. Vincent was taping her for the Andy Warhol's TV show and he had Lisa Robinson there interviewing her and Chris. I sat in on it so that I would have a higher profile on the tape for the TV show. Lisa is a good interviewer. They were there till 4:00. And I have decided I am not going to call girls anymore and invite them places because they are too difficult. I called Sean Young that really pretty actress who I met with Linda Stein because I thought that Richard Weisman would like her. But she would not give me her home number so I could call her back and it is too hard. I asked her if she wanted to go to a baseball game and she said she would been to one once already. she is in some James Ivory movie that is about to come out. I had to leave early because I invited Bianca to the Peking Opera she said yes and I invited John Samuels too. We ran into the Met Opera House and had just missed the curtain so we had to wait with Chinese people screaming why could not they go in. I think it is so ridiculous that the Met tries to be so sophisticated and not let you in if you are twenty seconds late. Especially with something like this Chinese opera because Chinese people talk all through their operas and make noise anyway. Then after ten minutes we could go in. Fran Lebowitz was there with Jed. The opera was boring. Good costumes lots of tumbling. Drag queens. I saw Margaret Hamilton the witch in The Wizard of Oz and got so excited and went over to her and told her how wonderful she was. She does the Maxwell House commercials now. she is really small. Bianca's trying to get Halston to get a ticket for John Samuels to go on the China trip too. I asked her why she went on the Tomorrow show if she did not have anything to say. And she said that she did that she was in the new Burt Reynolds movie Cannonball II. But big deal-she is in one scene she worked one week.
"Tuesday, August 12, 1986","[John Wayne, Kent Klineman]",-0.06845238095238095,"Kent Klineman was around. He brought a forty-page contract for me to sign about the John Wayne thing. he is there saying ""I do not like the color. What color will the lips be?"" And I mean it is a blue face! What difference does the color of the lips make when it is a blue face? I mean he is ridiculous."
"Tuesday, August 13, 1985","[Bruce Springsteen, Dolly Fox, Eric Roberts, Sandy Dennis]",0.1904761904761905,Dolly Fox came by the office and I wanted her to meet Cornelia. And they got along great they were talking about the people they have introduced that then fall in love and why can not it happen to them and Dolly came up with that it was because they were rich. Because Dolly had to talk Julianne into going to see Bruce Springsteen and then they went backstage and Bruce and Julianne's eyes met and that was it. I asked Dolly if she would fucked Bruce before she introduced him and Julianne and she said no but that she would been just about to. And I asked if Julianne had done it with Bruce on the first night and she said no not on the first night. And Dolly also introduced her friend Dana to Eric Roberts and he immediately left Sandy Dennis and now they are going to get married. Dolly looked beautiful-her eyebrows are so perfect and so is her eye makeup.
"Tuesday, August 14, 1984","[Ann Jillian, Edmund Gaultney, Jane Holzer, Kent Klineman, Madame Defarge, Mae West]",0.07878787878787878,Brigid's pug walked across the painting I would just done. He had orange and purple feet. Madame Defarge kept knitting away. Worked till 7:00. I did not go to dinner with Edmund Gaultney and the people who want to do a portfolio. Hedy and Kent Klineman. she is a friend of Jane Holzer's. But I just get this feeling about it: People finance a portfolio and then start to get nervous and dump all the prints (cab $7). Home at 10:30. Watched Ann Jillian play Mae West and she was good. They always give them a big love affair they make that the big thing.
"Tuesday, August 18, 1981","[Katharine Hepburn, Mark Lee, Mel Gibson, Michael Jackson, Stephanie Mills]",0.11622023809523808,It was a really beautiful day the weather's still good because of the fairy hurricane. Dennis. Picked up Jon went to the St. Moritz to Allan Carr's penthouse. He was having a party for the two stars of Gallipoli Mark Lee and Mel Gibson and then a screening of the movie afterwards. Cabbed to Madison Square Garden ($5). Susan got us backstage and she was screaming that Katharine Hepburn was backstage and that if I did not hurry I would not have my picture taken with her but I missed it all. Michael Jackson introduced us to his brothers they all said they wanted portraits. Michael's gotten so handsome since I saw him that time with Stephanie Mills. We went out to the audience and it was hard to get our seats. We had to kick kids out of them. Michael's show was maybe the best I have seen. he is such a good dancer and he goes into a hole and comes out the other side in a different outfit I do not know how he does it. I was dropping Jon off and as we passed Columbus Circle I saw Mark and Mel the two stars of Gallipoli alone just sort of wandering and it was sad. Their party was over and they looked lost like they did not have anywhere else to go.
"Tuesday, August 19, 1980","[Patti LuPone, Princess Holstein]",0.05092592592592593,Bob was in a cranky mood all day. I told him we had to do Patti LuPone on the cover and he went into a tizzy screaming. He said it looked too similar to Paloma. they are both Latins. But oh Bob is so immature. He does a baby tantrum when he wants something and then he does his guilty thing. it is just so predictable. Bob thinks he has too much to do. He thinks he has no personal life. He said he does not like going around with these old ladies that he just does it for me but then he admitted that he did not mind the trips sometimes that he does not mind the old girls sometimes but that he would rather be with his own friends. Which friends? I do not know. People he is met from work! And then on these scenes Fred is always called in and after his own night of binging then he has to act mature and be the know-it-all and straighten Bob out. And after weeks of Princess Holstein asking to help me I finally told her she could help me trace and then she disappeared for an hour and I had to do it alone and when she came back I asked her where she would been and she said she had a phone call. she is becoming Ronnie's assistant-she sits and talks to Ronnie because he does not have anything to do. And then Robyn spends his days calling up his friends to look up who the princess's relatives are. So that is the state of the office.

I could not believe that. He said he would come after dinner. Sam picked me up. I was working on my Wig painting. Jumped in a cab and went to 73rd and First Avenue to Petaluma for Alan Rish's dinner for Tama and it was a really great crowd. Alan Rish finally gave a really great party. Paul Morrissey was being funny he knows I have hated David Weisman ever since Ciao Manhattan so he brought him over and said to me ""Andy may I present David Weisman"" and I just-I could not do it. I could not let bygones be bygones. I looked away from him I did not want to do it. Weisman's now a producer on Ironweed Jack Nicholson's going to star. Paul Shaffer came over and said why did not we work on a TV special together produce it. I told him he could be the new Ed Sullivan and he liked that. The party began when Dianne Brill arrived with her tits and a big better-looking version of her ex Rudolf and the Savitt girl had a not-as-attractive version of Rudolf with her. It was the creme de la party scene. Patrick McMullan and I talked he said he is really getting into girls now. They put me with Tama at her publisher's table Crown. Which is also our publisher for the Party book I guess but nobody said anything to me like that they knew about it. It was a wild party lots of table-hopping and Tama had her Texas millionaire boyfriend there. Paul Morrissey's acting discovery from Mixed Blood little Rodney Harvey was there and Rene Ricard and Susan Blond and her husband. Anita Sarko and Michael Musto wearing a slave costume. Billy Norwich from the Daily News was there and Lou Reed's wife Sylvia. And Steve Aronson with Kathy Johnson. So it was fun. Tama left I guess she went home to fuck her boyfriend. Some people were going down to a party at Revolution. Sam walked me home and we bought the Enquirer and a Dove Bar at the Food Emporium. Got home and PH called to find out if I saw anyone near her gold Fiorucci bag-it got stolen at the party and her camera and keys were in it."
"Tuesday, August 21, 1979",[],-0.017857142857142856,Worked until 7:30 (cab $4). Went home and did some drawings. Not one single person called. I guess everyone must be on vacation.

Oh and the Sam Goldwyn affair. According to Truman Sam Goldwyn went after him one day and said ""you have been teasing me for years"" and then he gave Truman a big long tongue kiss. He wanted Truman to go down on him but Truman would not but now he thinks it might have been fun. Truman said he said ""What about Frances?"" And that Sam Goldwyn said ""Forget Frances."" And when I was recording this tape I would purposely talked nice about Brigid so she would hear it while she typed-I said she used to be 350 pounds and now she was 125 and beautiful. So she was a happy worker. I was painting in the back when I heard a big commotion and it was Bob screaming at Catherine he had freaked out. He was checking the galleys for the new issue and saying that she had not corrected Fran Lebowitz's writing and she said that Fran did not want anyone to correct her. Bob said if Catherine would not do it he would. He was holding a glass of vodka in his hand."

Picked up Catherine. Bob began asking Diahnne (laughs) in many different ways how it felt to be colored. ""Are you really colored? How do you feel about your skin? Do you like to dance?"" And then he got it down to what did it feel like to be colored and in bed with Bobby De Niro. Then I think she must have slipped Bob some coke-he went into the bathroom and came back a zombie. Diana Vreeland was there for dinner with Alessandro Albrizzi from Venice at a table behind us. Then later as we were leaving I introduced Diahnne to Diana and Diana said ""I am madly in love with your husband."" We went over in Diahnne's car to Studio 54. Fred and Ahmet Ertegun and Earl McGrath were there. Earl said he was thrilled that Fred had agreed to so little money for the billboard I will be doing for the Stones. Diahnne did not like the music that was playing it was not right she wanted to leave. Went up to Elaine's. She played some songs on the jukebox that she was not able to hear at Studio 54. Bob continued the questioning on how it felt to be colored. She told about her waitressing jobs in the Village at the Left or Right Bank places like that. Then Bob asked her about politics and she said she did not think about it and then Bob brought up Idi Aminl I mean everything he said was colored (Elaine's $50). Then Diahnne invited us down to her apartment. It was peculiar it was like this meant she was really accepting us or something. Barrow Street. She had clothes all over she was buying lots and lots of clothes. they are looking for a new apartment and I suggested Park Avenue but she said they have an image to protect. She served Dom Perignon showed us baby pictures. She let the limo go which was tacky and we had to cab home. As we passed the Studio 54 neighborhood Bob screamed ""Let me out let me out"" (cab $5)."

I want to go!"" Picked her up. Got to Bergdorf's (cab $7) and there was a waiter for every single guest. And at the top of each escalator a male model was waiting. John Duka from the Times was there so we were trying to be quotable and make the papers telling him that we would been to openings of doors windows envelopes and now-an escalator!"

Susan Blond called and said she had tickets for Boy George that night in Asbury Park and she said I could have two and Keith could have two. It was a benefit for B'nai Brith. Ron Delsener did it and he was there and wanting me for publicity and I said ""Oh what about that night at Tina Turner where you just could not get us backstage?"" And he said ""Uh-uh-uh oh it was impossible."" I did not tell him off but I wanted to. So we went out there with Susan and we were late we missed his first number. We went backstage. And then we went back out and the kids were screaming ""An-dee An-dee!"" To be funny. George did three encores. And he signed a million autographs now that he is come down in the world-he always refused to before. He was thrilled to see us. Marilyn was not around and we were told by Susan not to mention him in front of George's boyfriend because I guess he is jealous of him. And Keith and everybody were making fun of Asbury Park of George being there and it was ""Oh! The Asbury Park news is here."" And ""Oh the Asbury Park TV station is doing an interview!"" And George said to Keith ""where is my painting?"" Because when it was Keith's birthday George had he said he would sing ""Happy Birthday"" if Keith would give him a painting. And Keith said he would give him a painting but because he wanted to not because George sang ""Happy Birthday."""

Then Jack Palance came in and he would been out all night drinking. he is fifty-five and looks thirty. he is there with his dog Patches and his girlfriend. I think he is half Russian and half Ukranian. I would asked Tom how they thought to cast Jack Palance and he said they were thinking about Rod Steiger-they wanted somebody butch an old butch actor-but Jack had a farm in Pennsylvania and they called him and he will do anything he said he just likes to drink so he takes any role. Jack played a character named Rof who used to be Jayne Mansfield's manager and Tom plays one called Destin who is a singer with a band. We went outside to do my scene where I am taking pictures without knowing it of the people who run off with the coke. They decided to put me in the beginning of the movie and gave me some lines which I am terrible at. I just do not know how to be real. I interviewed Tom at dinner and his real life story was just like his character's life story in the movie-how he burned his body in a plane crash in Colombia and some people found him and took him in a private plane to New York. I passed out in the limo on the way back in and we got to the city around 2:30.

Went to Park Avenue to get a cab downtown and one pulled up and the door opened and it was lovely Barbara Rose saying ""let us share a cab downtown."" The fare on the meter was already past $3 I noticed. she is now going with Jerry Leiber the Leiber-Stoller guy who wrote ""Hound Dog"" and so she talked about Elvis although I do not think Leiber went to the funeral in Memphis. She said she and Leiber are writing or have written a play and they want Al Pacino to play Elvis. God I just hate her. she is so awful (cab total $7). they are saying that the article Caroline Kennedy did on the Elvis funeral for Rolling Stone made fun of the local people but I can understand that-Caroline's really intelligent and the people down there really were dumb. Elvis never knew there were more interesting people. When I got to 12th Street I walked around University Place for ideas. Then over to the office. Sandy Brant was there with Jed going over decorating schemes for Peter Brant and Joe Allen's office building in Greenwich that Philip Johnson designed. Jed's in the decorating business now. Cab to Alkit Camera ($3) on 53rd and Third. The cab driver did not even turn around to look at me but he knew who I was. I asked him how he could tell. He said that he would been buying art since he was twenty and just ""stacking it around the house like the Collyer Brothers."" He went to auctions and places for art bargains and he was thrilled to have me in the cab. I got a new camera because I had to take pictures of Chrissie Evert later in the afternoon. For the Athletes series. Had Bettina the famous Chanel model from the fifties to lunch. she is the beautiful one who was in the car with Aly Khan when he died. she is here to open an Ungaro store on Madison around the corner from my house. She was wearing a purple dress. Chrissie said she and Burt Reynolds were talking about me recently and that is why she wanted to do this. Victor came in and he started dragging out the Shadow paintings of cocks and assholes that I have been doing-the paintings all the ""landscapes"" have been posing for-and somebody had to tell him not to. I gave her a copy of the Burt Reynolds issue of Interview."

I do not call him at all. I suppose I should. But I think about boys too much when I associate with him. The Argentine lady came and wrote out a fat check for her portraits which was great it pays a month's mortgage on the new building. And last month Pia Zadora's check did that so that was a lift. Fred went to Dr. Karen for his collagen test and he said that she is klutzy and actually she is when I think about it. One thing she is got to learn is not to have people lie down. Because if you lie down all the wrinkles go away and how can you tell where to put the stuff? You should actually be hanging forward or something so the wrinkles would really be exaggerated.

I said I would go but I knew I would cancel because I am so tired of elegant people I just wanted to be with some kids. Then I ran out of Interviews and I was near John Reinhold's so I stopped in and we went into the McCreedy and Schreiber shoe store on 46th and just sat there for an hour because it was air-conditioned. I decided that being a shoe salesman is really a sexy job sort of even for a guy doing girl's shoes. Stopped in at Jean's and looked at a watch. Jon has gone off to California.
"Tuesday, August 5, 1980","[Stephen Graham, Susan Johnson]",-0.071875,Missed watching the Today Show with Truman but it sounds like it was the same old thing. Brigid tried to get Truman on the phone but he had it off the hook. The review of Music for Chameleons in the Times did not mention that some of the stories were from Interview. Halston wanted to give me a party for my birthday but I said I was going to the theater with Stephen Graham. I am going to invite Susan Johnson for him because he likes dumb girls. I wonder if they will hit it off. No she will not like him. Halston gave me a whole box of ugly shoes for my birthday.

And since it was my birthday I decided to do all sugar just an all-sugar day not deny myself anything (cab $6). All this Happy Birthday stuff. Bernard the drag performance artist brought me the greatest present he is really clever. A beautiful package from Van Cleef & Arpels and inside was a big beautiful bracelet box just everything perfect and beautiful and I was so excited and inside the bracelet box was a typed card and it said ""Andy Warhol wants nothing for his birthday"" because that was what I told a magazine was the best present. ""Nothing."" I do not know if he had to pay for the packaging or what. So I came face to face with my own philosophy and I was (laughs) so let down. It was great. it is worse than eating your own words getting them back in a Van Cleef & Arpels box. Cornelia called and was so sour. She never even sent a gift or anything and did not mention my birthday. Stephen Sprouse brought me a gift one of his old paintings. Keith asked me who I wanted for the dinner. He said his birthday present was to take me down to Glenn O'Brien's softball team's game where Matt Dillon was going to be playing down on Leroy Street with the graffiti artists against them so that was something to look forward to. Glenn's team was playing against Futura's graffiti team with Matt Dillon. And Ronnie was on Glenn's team and then this girl was walking by with a little dog and she stopped and said hi and guess who it was. Gigi! She said she and Ronnie have been back together for two weeks. And I just looked at that dog and all I could think of was how Ronnie drowned the cats when he and Gigi were breaking up. And now he is broken up with Tama Janowitz who was really nice. And Maria the jewelry designer was nice too. Gigi said that she works for the movies. And Matt Dillon struck out with three people on base but he was cute. And then Lidija came by they would told her at the office that I would be there. Jay was not playing because he would hurt his arm or leg. And Wilfredo is so crazy about Matt Dillon that he carries around a paperback called (laughs) The Life of Matt Dillon. I am not kidding it is a real book."

He knew my birthday was the day before but I guess he just did not want to have to do it on a Monday. It was nice just for the kids from the office. Truman was there and D.D. Ryan told him that she liked the Siamese Twins interview he did with himself seven or eight years ago that was just like the one he did in this month's Interview and he got very embarrassed and at first he denied he would ever done one like it but then later he admitted that he had. Ronnie came with a girl dressed as a nurse who is a bartender at the Mudd Club. Then out came the birthday cake which was a huge baked cookie like a Famous Amos only it looked like a big plop of shit it was funny. Halston did not give me the kind of expensive presents he did last year I guess he thought it was too hard to go through that and do it every year so he broke the tradition and gave me twenty boxes. One had skates another had a helmet another had a radio and then earphones and then kneepads and then gloves and a How to Skate book. And Victor had his own skates too so we went outside and skated in front of the house. It was fun. Jane Holzer and Bob Denison came late. Then we ordered limos to go to Studio 54. Oh and Steve gave me a good present. A roll of 5000 of the new free drink tickets he would just had printed up for the new year.

He was saying he does not believe in vitamins. I am going to stop taking them and see if I feel better. I was meeting David Whitney and Philip Johnson for dinner at the Four Seasons. Invited Keith and Juan and Jean Michel Basquiat. Philip goes to bed at 9:00 so he wanted to have dinner at 6:30 but I made it 7:30. The Four Seasons was jammed. I expected good food I would been spoiled by Jams the night before but the food was terrible. Doc Cox was there. I would put on my Stephen Sprouse neon tie. I really looked like the sixties. Helen Frankenthaler was at another table with Andre Emmerich and she sent a note to Philip that she was keeping an eye on him with all the boys and I have got that note and it goes into the archives. Everyone was sort of quiet not much chit-chat. Then David got drunk and started what he always starts when he is had a few drinks that when Philip kicks the bucket he will move in with me. it is scary. Keith wanted to go to Rounds the gay place at 53rd and Second and I did not so I said I would never been there because I had not in five years and so we walk in the door and the first thing the waiter says is (laughs) ""Mr. Warhol! it is so nice to see you again!"" Jean Michel Basquiat would not go to Rounds. He called this morning and told me that in the old days when he did not have any money he would hustle and get $10 and he did not want to remember that. So Jean Michel Basquiat went downtown with Keith. I walked the Doc uptown and he kissed me on the cheek which was so tender."

He said that when he got home from Halston's he found the two cats and one of them was choking on a sponge that it had tried to eat because it was so hungry and the other was clawing at the one who was choking so he took them into the bathtub and drowned them and then threw their little bodies in the incinerator. He said he was going to go down and divorce Gigi. He said he had not fed the cats or himself in five days because he did not have any money and when Brigid said why did not he just borrow some he said he was ""too proud."" I think he starved them to get back at Gigi. I knew they never should have gotten married. How could you kill two innocent cats? I could not even look at him. Then the Carimatis called and invited us for dinner but it was the Italian style of ""I will call you and you call me before 5:00 and then I will call you and you call me back before 6:00."" They said they could get us 40 percent discounts on anything on Madison Avenue because it was all Italians now."

And I know Schnabel thought that mine would be the one that got him a lot of press. Paige stayed overnight with Jean Michel Basquiat in his dirty smelly loft downtown. How I know it smells is because Chris was there and said (laughs) it was like a nigger's loft that there were crumpled-up hundred-dollar bills in the corner and bad b.o. all over and you step on paintings. The day Jean Michel Basquiat came over to exercise with me he made a point of saying that Paige had made it to work on time so that is how he was letting me know. he would thought that Paige was Jay's girlfriend which she was at one point but then he asked her out and she went. And they had a date and this was the date-they rented a you-Haul and went out to Brooklyn to a black neighborhood and went to a White Castle and had eight hamburgers and then two people came in with big sticks and they thought they were going to kill them. You know it was a ""kooky date."" This was the day before he went to St. Moritz to see Bruno. Mary Boone and Bruno are both handling him. And Thomas Ammann without either one of them knowing had a few works of Jean Michel Basquiat's to sell. I do not know where he got them. He said from some ""secret source""-oh wait! I bet it was Paige! Oh Thomas is a creep meeting all these people through us and then being secretive. I bet they were from Paige because she had that show a few months ago of Jean Michel Basquiat's stuff!"

She said her Harrison Ford cover interview is still up in the air he probably will not do it but he has not given Gael a definite no. Interviewed Chris Reeve yesterday Maura and I did and he was good he was still drunk from the night before. he is got a good attitude now not like he had when he started. Now he will take any role. Fred's been so crabby lately. We have not been hitting it off. I do not know if he is bored and wants to be a decorator or if he is just crabby. He gets these attitudes. And it is scary because he used to have the best memory in the world and now he says softly to me ""Now tell me who is this person you introduced me to?"" And he is talking about Dawn Mello who he knows! it is scary. Burt Reynolds was on Letterman and was so funny because there he was acting so straight and copying Clark Gable and then he said that he arrived in New York with George Maharis!

Benjamin and I walked down Madison Avenue and saw all the stuff I want but it is the same old problem-you do not know whether to get a lot of the cheaper little things or one big expensive thing. And this year I notice that people are back to new things. Last year it was retro. If you had a thirties watch on last year it was chic. But now it is back to Corums and things. Pocket watches are out. Wristwatches are in but they are sort of finishing. that is the second collecting trend that I started the wristwatch one. The first was Deco. This year you can get pocket watches that were $12000 last year for $4000. And ones that were $85000 you can get now for $35000. We went to the office and I read the Rolling Stone where Jann Wenner puts down all his best friends. He put me in with the most ""Overrated People."" And you would think since he owns my Maos that he would be putting me up. I wonder why not. Oh I know maybe he sold them! And you know it was Joe Allen who sold the Silver Elvis! And he sold all his furniture and everything the new wife is really moving in there. Jed is doing their apartment. Decided to go to Peter Beard's party at Heartbreak. Peter was at the door showing slides. The usual. Africa. Cheryl on a turkey. Barbara Allen on a turkey. Bloodstains. (laughs) You know."

Walter Stait from Philadelphia took me to La Grenouille for lunch he told Maxime and Loulou de la Falaise to meet us there. On the other side of the room was the new skinny Truman Capote. He looks now almost like he did when I first knew him. Truman did not answer my hello but then halfway through lunch he put on his glasses and waved and later he gave me his personal phone number. All of the chic girls were in YSL fur hats. Worked at 860 all afternoon then Francois de Menil arrived to take me out to Norman Mailer's in Brooklyn Heights. He used to live in a whole house but now he lives on just the top and rents the bottom out and he is had the front part made all glass looking out over Manhattan and it is beautiful. Wall to wall it was an intellectual party like from the sixties. Arthur Schlesinger Mica and Ahmet the girl who wrote the book on LBJ. Norman looks good now white hair looks Irish. His little mother was there. And Jean Kennedy Smith and her husband. Sandra Hochman told me I am a chapter in her upcoming book she talked to me about the women's movement and junk like that. She said ""I have your picture on my mantel"" but I just know she does not. Isabella Rossellini was at Norman's she is working for Italian television she is doing a thing on boxers that is probably why she was there because Jose Torres was there. She said she ran over to see me when she saw her mother Ingrid Bergman talking to me at the Pierre a couple of weeks ago but that I would gone. She could not find her coat when she was leaving Norman's and just left without it. Norman was sweet and he and Francois must be really friends because they hugged and kissed and punched a lot.

And it seems now that it is just me who goes there. it is so lonely there I am probably his only customer. he will probably break my back so I will have to keep going to him (phone calls $.20). Then went back and worked on my Alfred Hitchcock portrait for Vanity Fair. Waited for Rupert. Mr. LeFrak called and I have got to get to work on his portrait. Then there was a screening of Gandhi and went to that at the Columbia screening room at 56th and Fifth and the movie was just thrilling. It was three hours long and the only thing that ruined it was Miss Candice Bergen. it is like a jolt of reality. Suddenly there she is saying that she is Margaret Bourke-White of Life magazine the photographer. she is just awful. Jarring. Like me in The Driver's Seat. I was so bad in that. But I could have been good if they used me good. Oh and some movie star told me recently that Bad was the best movie they would ever seen. Now who was it ... ? Oh it was Jeff Bridges! He loved Badi

It was not completely sold-out but it was pretty filled. Truman was cute he explained each thing first he got up on his toes and snapped his fingers and it was like disco and that was the best part. He read and acted the parts out. He read the maid story and he read ""A Christmas Memory"" and a couple of other ones. Then afterward everybody was telling him how wonderful he was because it was all friends. Rex told him the reading ""touched my soul."" Truman was shaking.

And he gets on the phone and says ""Dahling! Come right down!"" and it will be Al Pacino who is tearing himself away from Diane Keaton to come down and see him. Or it will be Dustin Hoffman. And the secretaries say things to him like ""You can either see your editor at Random House at 2:44 and get out by 3:32 or at 3:46 and get out by 4:34"" and Julian says ""I will take the 2:44."" And he is painting over beautiful Japanese backgrounds and ruining them. And he is got tarpaulins with words glued on them and he says ""These are from my San Salvadorean exposition."" It was the most pretentious afternoon I have ever had. And I left there completely convinced I should buy a Schnabel. Fred thinks so too. I told Julian I would give him a ride uptown and we went outside and there is a limousine parked and he is striding toward it and I said ""Uh Julian that is not my car"" and I pointed to Tony in the little Japanese one.

At Halston's I was next to Martha Graham who really looked old for the first time. I guess maybe it is just that she always wears makeup and did not have any on. The Daily News took a lot of pictures of me with Liza. I told her that I did not know what to say about her miscarriage but she said she was okay. We had lunch at the office for a photographer friend of Alexander Guest's who was going to take pictures of Bob and me afterwards for Penthouse. A girl made me and Bob up with black eyes and bleeding lips. It looked good real. Then they took us down to Avenue C and 4th Street to a school. The whole area looks bombed out. And then the school let ten kids out (laughs) to pose as kids who just mugged us. It was so cold. And a kid yelled at me ""do not go to too many parties."" They said they were allowed out of their typing classes. I do not know exactly what kind of school it was-they had karate classes there too. The kids were cute. We posed against real graffiti. And I mean I could not believe a school was letting kids out to pose with pussy in Penthouse and then I found out that they were not even getting paid! And I told the guy in charge he was horrible for not paying them and he got really funny about it but then they took down their names. Then we went back to the office."

Paige is breaking up with her seventeen-year-old boyfriend. she is going off to Haiti. Ran into one of those kids from Harvard in the sixties one of Edie's friends I can not remember his name. And I showed him my crystals and told him about crystal power and he was just standing there with his mouth open. He said he could not believe that someone as smart as me would start believing in crystals after I made it all through the sixties and everything and laughed at all the hippie stuff and that this is just the recycle of it. But really it is not the same and you do have to be positive not negative. He said he is developing land deals in Washington State.

And Barbara Allen said Halston told her how much fun I am without Bob and Fred around that when I am with them I do not say anything and let them take over but that when I am alone I talk and have fun. Halston has such an odd idea of me. I should have called him yesterday. it is so hard being completely involved though. We went to Irving Blum's gallery on East 75th Street to see the show of my early stuff and one of the Soup Cans was a fake. Irving was embarrassed when I told him. Victor called he is back from San Francisco. You really can not kid with him because you say a word and that word goes deep into his brain and he keeps thinking about it and he gets crazy. I called him ""paranoid"" and then he started brooding over it.

No mention of Steve Rubell no Halston-just me Marisa Bianca Truman Lorna Luft-the silly people and the silly places. And later at Halston's Halston said he is glad he was not mentioned because he said [imitates] ""I am! Not! Silly!"" And then everyone started calling Bianca ""silly pussy silly pussy.""

The big stars there were Lillian Gish Maureen Stapleton Tammy Grimes. I met Mr. Hurrell and he is really strong and straight and Paul Morrissey had said that he was about to pop off any minute but there he was and he knew all about me and he raved and he was sweet and I asked him if I could take a picture and he said sure. Maureen O'Sullivan was next to me and she was saying ""Oh I have just been throwing out so many Hurrells and Clarence Bulls we have been moving."" I asked her what it was like to get so close to Johnny Weissmuller's body and she said it was okay but that she only was interested in intellectuals my dear.

There was a wake for Martin that I guess Madonna was giving. It was too hard to get around though so I skipped all that. Put black tie on and Wilfredo picked me up and we went to Cornelia's and it was such a horrible party (cab $8). They treated Wilfredo badly he had to sit on the side and I was next to Tony Peck.

Talked on the phone to John Reinhold for two hours. Fell asleep and then woke up. Then went and broke into Jon's cinnamon nuts and had them. Drank some cognac.

Went around Fifth Avenue looking for ideas for art projects (cabs $5.75). Went to 860 for lunch with Todd Brassner and Rainer Crone but I could not spend too much time with them I was painting in the back. Todd was asking Rainer questions about some paintings of mine he was interested in because Rainer wrote the Praeger art book on me and he knows who owned which canvases. Catherine called Dustin Hoffman who said that the screening was at 5:45 at 666 Fifth. Dustin had filmed his wife Anne doing a Balanchine dance his kids were in it and I think he got a very good guy to cut it because it looks very professional. When it was over Dustin invited us back to his house on East 61st Street. it is back to back with Phyllis Cerf's house. Dustin was nervous really nervous about his house and he was taking me around and showing me every little thing. His taste was oak but not good oak so it was funny.

I wanted to Christmas shop but then I decided it might be too hard later to get a cab so I got one right then (cab $7). John John Kennedy was at the office and Cornelia Guest and John Samuels and Jimmy Burden-all these kids that I knew when they were babies it was so strange. And Jackie O. did not invite me to her Christmas party this year. I gave out some Popisms. Ronnie gave me one of his artworks it was really great-a spear. The article in The New York Times about Francoise de la Renta was just so disgusting as if she and Oscar have this great life when it is all just him and the friend and her suffering through it. And John Richardson was disinvited by them to Santo Domingo because he gave a quote which was not even really bad. And Bob told me that it turns out Francoise was not born in Paris she was born in Mozambique or someplace like that and she is just-trash.

The kid there likes me and he gives me things really cheap. They have the best fabrics there antique fabrics. I should have gotten Fred a lot of those. And Fred gave me a great book an old one on beautiful Greek statues for my new paintings. Paige and Fred are the best of friends now. He gave in and she gave in. I got Paige something she really loved I guess because she squealed and it was just a book on Clemente. But the book was just an extra-I owe Paige a lot of money.

And I told Gael to come up and pose for pictures because I was going to do a drawing of her because Fred told me that I had to. She looks good now very thin. Her hair's beautiful and her skin is strong and she does not wear makeup. Peter her husband had come to pick her up and she was wearing a pale pink leather dress and I said ""Oh where did you get that pretty dress?"" and the first thing she says is ""Well you know I never ever take anything for free but they sold this to me for $10 because nobody wanted it!"" She was very defensive right away to tell me that as if she knew that I was hearing about all the stuff she gets for presents from her business admirers in L.A. sending her flowers and candy and stuff. I forget that these Interview editors actually are powerful. And I told her she should be going out to dinner with people constantly like Annie Flanders from Details does and she said ""I am not a hustler."" And Greg Gorman the photographer from L.A was at the Interview party and told me that Joe Dallesandro's got a big role in a new TV cop series that is starting in January. Then went home and Gael and Peter dropped me off. I ran into the 6'5"" son of my neighbor Dr. Hamilton. He got so tall suddenly this year now that he went off to college. he is handsome. he is the one that used to play ball in the street with the father and the one who said he used to see Yul Brynner run into the building across the street to see some woman and this kid would time how long it took them. Took a gang to Nippon for Christmas Eve dinner and I gave out the little Be Somebody with a Body paintings (dinner $280). And then we went down to Kenny Scharf's loft on Great Jones. In the bedroom Kenny had these original Flintstones and Jetson cartoon drawings and he said ""Jon Gould got these for me."" He actually said that to me. That was so odd to hear. He said Jon got them at an auction. I mean you know somebody they are living in your house and then suddenly they do not know you anymore but they still see all your friends.

Bob wanted to meet them so badly but he would shove me out first and I would shrink back so it never happened. Passed out Interviews there really were great places to do it. Three people asked for my autograph. Everybody stares at me because I am wearing my wolf parka by Halston. We went to a bar that shows ski movies you drink beer and watch skiers. Nobody came over and asked for our drink orders so we did not drink anything and just watched the movie and then left. We were having dinner with Nan Kempner.

Arne Glimcher was there he is producing a Robert Redford movie about the art world. We went to the Lewises' house. We chit-chatted and then people had to change into black tie at the Lewises' to go over to the museum. I was just in a turtleneck and my coat so all day it looked like I was about to leave. My Calvin Klein with the hood. But for some reason nobody thought it was unusual. They told me that at 6:00 I would have to be on TV live so I got nervous about it being live. But then I did not care and I got it over with. Julian Schnabel and his wife came they would missed the plane and Alex Katz had missed his too. And I had to go to the bathroom because of all the vitamin C I am taking now and the bathroom was full of guys with cigars and I am really going to have to get over this bathroom phobia because I just feel so ... I mean there was a stall but somebody was in it and I tried to wait but ... And they said ""Oh you are Andy Warhol"" and I am trying to pee and then right after you pee they want to shake your hand. Leo Castelli was there with Toiny and she is a lost soul and he is really out of it. But the horrible thing was seeing everybody looking thirty years older. I am so spoiled from going around with nineteen-year-olds. At least Ivan Karp has a lot of energy and he is fun. Oh and Ivan says he is (laughs) collecting Barbarian jewelry now he gets it at a store in the East 90s. The tribe-the original hordes."

I feel left out. I think Calvin had a party and did not invite me and Bianca's in town and I did not hear from her she never even called to say she was coming by for her Christmas gift. And I mean she does not have many other friends. But New Year's was easy and unemotional. Nobody was mushy. During the day Jay was moping around the office but he is been better since I had the talk with him about all his negativity probably causing the cold sores on his mouth. Bought the papers and saw that the eyeglass place had given an item to the newspapers that I buy my glasses there and that they are bulletproof like the president of Nicaragua's (newspapers $5 cabs $3 $2). I mean I am not going to go there anymore. Why would they make that up? I mean what are bulletproof eyeglasses? What could they do for you? I was going to call lots of people and wish them Happy New Year but then I could not get it together to call anybody. Sam picked up PH and they came to pick me up (cab $10). So we got to Jane Holzer's and of course she was not ready after telling me she wanted to get to Roy Cohn's party at 9:00 so she could really work the room for her real estate. She was still in her bathrobe. So then she got into her makeup and a black Armani jacket and pants. she is a little heavier. And so we went to Roy Cohn's townhouse and it was sad to see him like that it really was. He did not look old but God he looked so sick. I do not know what to describe it as. And it was people like Joey and Cindy Adams. Steve Dunleavy the Australian journalist said ""Give me a bon mot for the new year"" and I could not think of one. Roy's ninety-year-old aunt was there she owns Van Heusen shirts she was the one who gave permission for me to use Ronald Reagan's old Van Heusen ad in my painting. She was like a WASP dowager only with a hook nose and she still has every one of her marbles. Jane went over to her and said ""I am sure you do not remember me"" and she said ""Oh yes I do Jane and how is your wonderful son Rusty and his horseback riding?"" And Doris Lilly was there. And Roy's nephew or something from Palm Beach who writes for the Miami Herald and wants to write for Interview. Monique Van Vooren was there she walked into the front room shielding her face she said ""Oh my it is the same wonderful lighting as always."" Because it was horrible and bright and with this old crowd it was really a horror show. And then Regine was there and she invited us to the $2000-a-plate Julio Iglesias dinner-concert right afterwards at the Essex House so we got ourselves excited for that. Oh and I got a Christmas card from Jann Wenner and his wife and a baby. Did they have a baby or did they adopt one? The name was ""Wenner."" I do not remember her being pregnant. At Essex House the best thing was a girl came over and gave us all brass key chains that were engraved concert tickets that said: ""Julio Iglesias Essex House December 31 1985 $2000."" And Angie Dickinson was there who is always so nice. Sam went over and took her picture and told her he worked for me and she said ""Oh I love him."" Regis Philbin did a comedy introduction about people calling him Phoebus Region and Rebus Philbin and things like that and then he introduced the celebs and the spotlight went on me and I froze. And then at midnight they shot big spangles out of the cannons. And there were orchids and it was fun and Julio's great line was he comes out on stage and says ""I FEEL GUILTY! I LOVE YOU!"" And he kept talking about how we were all one family. And everybody who heard the price of this thing said that it must be a benefit but it was not it was just for Julio. Left there and went over to the Hard Rock Cafe and the rock and roll crowd there was the most corny crowd in the world. It always is. Some CNN people interviewed me on what I was going to be doing next year and I said I was working on a Barbie doll. And then somebody who came in told us that Ricky Nelson had just been killed in a plane crash in Texas."
"Tuesday, December 4, 1979",[],0.24232093663911847,"So tired after three weeks on the road with Bob and Fred to promote the Exposures book. The tour began so chicly in Washington when I sat in President Carter's box at Kennedy Center but it wound up in the gutter on Hollywood Boulevard in that B. Dalton's bookstore that used to be Pickwick Books. While I was signing there a woman with a knife wound in her stomach came in screaming ""This is not Andy Warhol! I went to bed with Andy Warhol and he is 7'8 he can not fit through doors and he would not be standing here like this in a bookshop because he is too paranoid!"" (laughs) And that may actually be an accurate quote. And at Neiman-Marcus in Dallas where they had a great party for us in their boiler room all the kids there said the book was ""neat"" and ""cool."" And the Texas people were all so gracious and considerate they say things like ""it is so kind of you to come all this way to see us."" I wish I could talk like that-I can not think of those beautiful lines. Oh and a big nice man in Dallas even insisted on personally taking us to the discotheque afterwards because he said ""I will tell you what you fellas will need some protection -it is a pret-ty gay atmosphere. Of course I guess you might be used to it coming from New York City and all."" And we laughed and looked to make sure he was kidding and he was not."

Her girlfriend is the lady with the Kimbell Museum that I did I can not remember her name and she says she does not want a big head like I usually paint-she wants something different a life-size portrait. She said she turned down Jackie O.'s portrait guy -what is his name? Is it Shickler? And she said that if I am going to do her portrait we have to ""get to know each other."" OH GOD OH GOD! She invited me to the $3 million house she is building in Fort Worth. When she kept talking about getting to know us I finally ran away. Then Fred ran away. But then we came back. Victor called and said he was on his way to Caracas and I told him ""do not do it Victor do not do it."" I think he might get stopped at the border it is too dangerous. I am afraid he is going to try something. I was invited over to William F. Buckley's for music at 6:00 they have things like that."

Bob had told them weeks ago when they invited me that I would come and just be present but that he would give the talk on Interview and they said fine. After Bob's speech though they asked questions all directed at me-and I was not prepared so I just said yes or no. But afterwards I regretted doing my same old shy act when I should have used the situation for practice-I would love to be able to talk more and give little speeches. I want to work on that. They asked Fran only one question why her column in Interview was called ""I Cover the Waterfront"" and she said that it was because Tennessee Williams was on a talk show once and they asked him if he was a homo and he said ""Well let us put it this way: I cover the waterfront."" And Fran's answer was a lead balloon nobody laughed. In the cab downtown she said she would rather have her appendix out than go to something like that again. Bianca called and invited me to a screening of Silver Streak. did not get home until 7:00 which was exactly when I was supposed to be at the Pierre to pick her up-she and Mick just rented a house on 72nd Street but it is not ready to move into yet. Went over to the Loews Tower East. The movie was kind of funny. Bianca looked beautiful. Afterwards outside the theater when we could not find the limo a black guy with a black scarf was pressing himself up against Bianca and he was crazy he was saying ""You think you are the only one with beautiful clothes in the world?"" Finally we found the car and went to La Grenouille. Isabel and Freddy Eberstadt and Mica Ertegun arrived and with them was Isabel and Freddy's beautiful daughter Nenna. I kept staring at her and saying how beautiful she was and Isabel sort of kept us apart. I could not figure out why they had asked me to this dinner because if I had not asked to bring Bianca there would have been just me. Mica was very sweet. She kept saying that Joe Allen was so attractive that how could Barbara Allen leave him. The Eberstadt daughter did not say anything during dinner but then she finally blurted out that she used to go to Union Square and stare up at the Factory so that was thrilling to hear from this beautiful girl. I told her she should come down and do interviews for Interview and she said ""Good! I need the money."" is not that a great line? I mean here Freddy's father died and left him a whole stock brokerage company. We said our good nights and thank-yous and I hope I remember to send flowers."

Got there did some videoing. Jeff Bridges is big and rugged like 6'2"" he is like a regular guy he was sweet and hard to talk to. Then he said he was an artist and he took Polaroids of me and I showed him my painting stuff gave him a tour and from the Polaroids he is going to do a portrait of me. And the kids photographing him for Interview did not know how to shoot him they had him doing all this silly stuff-they do not know that when you have a good-looking normal man you should just let him stand there. I gave him a Philosophy book."

Had to take Archie and Amos down to the office to be looked at by the Lewis Allen dummy people (cab $5). When I got there how do you Doody was waiting for me. I am doing his portrait he is one of the Big Myths. After I photographed how do you I got into the barber's chair that the dummy people brought. They did the back of my head they put a wig hat on me. There were two photographers and Ronnie was taking 3-D pictures. They put gook on and covered my ears and eyes. They said ""Pinch me if you want to get out of it."" It was making me sick and I had a cold and I had phlegm that I could not cough up it was awful. They finally took the mold off but then they dropped it. They were saying ""We can save it we can save it."" But then they said they might have to do another one and I said ""No you are not."" They stuck my hands in some more gook and that got some air bubbles so they lost a couple of fingers on that try. Then they did my teeth. And while this was going on Ron Reagan arrived he would just had lunch with his father at the Waldorf. I was so out of it I could not really talk. Bob had given Doria the day off-she is working for him now -but she did not go to the Waldorf lunch because Nancy still could not get over the idea that her son had married without her consent. And Bob was feeling his oats because the collector's issue of the Daily News that had ""John Lennon Shot"" headlines is the one that had the big story on him in it-""The Man Behind Andy Warhol."" It was a long article but it was boring. I watched the John Lennon news and it is so scary. I mean the other day the kid named Michael who is been writing me letters for five years just walked in-somebody buzzed him in-and he walked over and handed me another letter and left. Where does he live? In institutions?"

He was in an old hotel on West 72nd Street on the second floor (cab $4). And the guy did not believe in vitamins he did not believe in anything. He had fifteen framed things on the wall but I do not know what they could have been for. I lied about my age on the insurance thing I said I was born (laughs) in 1949. And then later Stuart told me it is a federal offense. Watched Letterman and God I hate it when he puts his tongue in his teeth and tries to be handsome for the camera. it is like he is doing whaf he does when he s home looking in the mirror.

Because it was a free lunch I forgot to give the headwaiter a tip. I always forget you still have to when it is free (coats $2). The Kelloggs had just found out this morning that he would not be getting the Chief of Protocol appointment that he really wanted. Mrs. Annenberg got it. I think Mercedes is the reason they did not get it because she is Iranian.

Vincent showed me the the video for this week's MTV show and it looks interesting different kind of odd. Cabbed to Clemente's ($5). I thought they entertained all the time but they said the last dinner party they had was the one we were at. Robert Mapplethorpe was there. He looked more healthy than I have ever seen him he had color in his face. I think they are trying out a new drug on him I hope he makes it. And we talked about the people from the seventies. I asked him about his old girlfriend Patti Smith and he said he would just shot her and I said why did not he give the pictures to Interview and he said Vogue already had them. And then that reminded me that I would bought People magazine and there was their article about Ivy Nicholson-she is now a bag lady in San Francisco and her twin sons are twenty-one years old. She looks like the most beautiful bag lady you will ever see though. It says she is fifty-three. she is up against the wall with her legs straight out and a form-fitting top. it is like with Nico-everything just looks right when she does it so it is these raggy clothes but they look great. And it is sort of the hippie look really with three crinolines and just the right (laughs) raggy bow. Left at 11:00 Paige dropped me.

He was telling Brigid lots of ideas for Interview saying he wanted to have regular Monday morning editorial meetings of the staff. But meetings like that are just a big waste of time. Other magazines do it that way but everybody at Interview just sort of does their own job. Other magazines schedule those big long meetings and that is when all these people's ideas about themselves and their positions come out-the ""power"" things. The meetings just bring out whether people think they are better or you are better."

Today was the election to see if she could win the seat Mayor Koch vacated. she is running against Bill Green. A lady who works for the governor came over and wanted to meet me she said she read my Philosophy book and that it is her favorite book it is her bible. She asked provocative questions about should kids at thirteen see pornography and what about Roman Polanski and Stan Dragoti who was there said that he used to live next door to Roman in Hollywood and that Roman actually did date eleven-year-olds. We concluded that Roman is now trying to relive his childhood. he is is now in Paris where he can not be extradited back. There were a lot of empty spaces at our table. Stan Dragoti is married to Cheryl Tiegs the model. He made it sound like they were really together and I had to catch myself every time I started to say something about Vitas because his wife Cheryl and Vitas are the hot couple lately around town but I did not slip. Picked up Catherine to go over to Vitas's Valentine's party at Le Club. Catherine had her boots on (cab $3). Peter Beard and Tom Sullivan arrived. Tom and Catherine have a pact that each of them can go anywhere and do anything with others and so he was with a ravingly beautiful sixteen-year-old model and she was (laughs) with me. Jerry Hall was there and she said that she was looking for a house for Mick and that she and he were going to live in together for six months.

Oh it is good. she is disguised and her fake nose catches on fire! it is the funniest one. Called Catherine about the lunch we were having for her that afternoon at the office. She invited about thirty people. Was picked up by Benjamin and went to Doc Cox's and saw Rosemary who is back. She says she stays up listening to Mahler and reading icon books and she goes to work at 4:00 in the morning and finishes at 10:00. Left there and went to Sotheby's but they tried to make me check my bags and I told them no and then they would not let me in so I walked out I told them they were losing my business for good. I mean it is my ""purse."" Ladies do not have to check their purses so why should I? Forgot to say that Diana Ross sent me a big bowl of candy kisses and she is so sweet I have to send her something. It looked like she could have wrapped this up herself. Oh and Crazy Matty had been up at 860 and left the worst letter it was crazy like Hinckley or something.

Oh and Brigid is at the English fat farm and she is going to be fired when she gets back. I will give her a pink slip. I will give her dogs pink slips-Fame and Fortune will be fired! Vincent was going to tape the fashion show and he called to say a car would pick me up at the office at 2:00. Ken came and we went downtown (cab $6). Worked hard at the office. Then went over to the Tunnel and they gave us the best dressing room but still it was absolutely freezing. I had all my makeup with me. Miles Davis was there and he has such delicate fingers. they are the same length as mine but half the width. I would gone with Jean Michel Basquiat last year to see his show at the Beacon and I would met him in the sixties at that store on Christopher Street Hernando's where we used to go get leather pants. I reminded him that I would met him there and he said he remembered. Miles is a clotheshorse. And we made a deal that we would trade ten minutes of him playing music for me for me doing his portrait. He gave me his address and a drawing- he draws while he gets his hair done. His hairdresser does the hair weaving the extensions. They did a $5000 custom outfit for Miles with gold musical notes on it and everything and they did not do a thing for me they were so mean. They could have made me a gold palette or something. So I looked like the poor stepchild and in the end they even (laughs) told me I walked too slow. And the clothes in the show really stank. Alligator fur and lace. And I really worked my ass off. The Japanese crew was more interested in me than in Miles. They were doing the show again at 10:00 but I did not have to do the second one I was only in the one that was for the press. And then afterwards Vincent had a taxi come. When I got home I called Fred and explained that I was just too exhausted to go to the Fendi dinner so when he called them to say I would not be coming with him and that he would bring a girl instead they said do not bother that they did not want him without me. Got into bed and Wilfredo called and then Sam called and then I fell asleep. But I woke up at 6:30 and I could not get back to sleep so I took some Valium and a Seconal and two aspirin and I was sleeping so heavily that I did not wake up when PH called at nine of the clock. And when I did not answer she got scared because that had never happened before so she called on the other line and Aurora answered in the kitchen and PH made her come up to my bedroom to shake me but I wish she would just let me sleep. [Andy did not tell the Diary but on Saturday February 14 he went to Dr. Karen Burke's for a collagen treatment; during the visit he complained of pains in his gallbladder. On Sunday Andy stayed in bed all day and the pain subsided. On Monday he kept his appointment with Dr. Linda M. Li at the Li Chiropractic Healing Arts Center. That night Dr. Burke called Andy to see how he was and when he admitted that he was again feeling the sharp pains she urged him to see his regular doctor Dr. Denton Cox. Although on Tuesday he made his ""celebrity appearance"" in the Japanese fashion show he was in pain for the rest of the night. Finally at 6:30 A.M. he took a painkiller and sleeping pill which made him sleep through the Wednesday 9 A.M. Diary phone call. On Thursday when Andy answered the phone at 9 A.M. he was breathing heavily. He told me hehad seen Dr. Cox and that he was going to ""the place"" to have ""it"" done (Andy's fear of hospitals and operations was so great that he could not bring himself to say those specific words) because ""they told me I will die if I do not."" He said he would resume doing the Diary after ""it"" was over that he would call me from ""the place."" On Friday February 20 Andy was admitted to New York Hospital as an ""ambulatory emergency patient."" On Saturday his gallbladder was removed and he appeared to be recovering well from the surgery-he watched television and made phone calls to friends.

Well the 20/20 thing that Karen Lerner shot during the Exposures tour is supposed to be on next week. The twenty-eighth. We had office pizza lunch ($5). Oh and this guy from New York called about the first part of Popism that they are running on the cover. would not it be great if the book was a big hit and we did not have to work to promote it? Ron Feldman came down and we looked at the Ten Jews. it is really such a good idea to do that they are going to sell. And all the Germans want portraits. Maybe because we have a good person selling there Hans Mayer. How come we do not get many American portraits?

I know I do not vote but so what I mean he is still awful. And they were showing on the news the clips of him in the past saying that he would never run for governor so he just changed his tune and that means he is just like everybody else he blows with the wind.

He called the police and they were in the backyard all day and by 6:00 they still had not taken the body away. He was from the flophouse next door. And Jean Michel Basquiat sent the cat that did not catch rats down to Atlanta he sent it on a plane for $100 down to some gallery there. The poor cat probably never got taken care of-I mean can you imagine being a cat in the hands of Jean Michel Basquiat? Tried to work with Fred and with Vincent but my room is so filled with junk I can not pull out of it. I tried on wigs from Fiorucci but it looked like too much of a big-hat wig too outrageous. This is for the Self-Portraits. Paige called a couple of times from the fat farm she went to and it was fun talking to her. The Music issue is going to cost us a lot. Cyndi Lauper is the cover.

And Gael had a fight with Glenn O'Brien because he sold the same interview he did for Interview to the new magazine Spin that Bob Guccione's son is doing that is competing with Rolling Stone and Glenn's telling her it was all the stuff that she had cut out so what difference did it make. I invited Benjamin to this Forbes opening at their building on 13th and Fifth Avenue now that they have turned the lobby into a museum (cab $4). Malcolm Forbes was there and I gave him a Dollar Sign painting and he was thrilled he loved it. Talked to a kid who worked there and told him that what I wanted for Christmas was Malcolm Forbes's junk mail and he said he would get me some. I wish Truman had given me his junk mail like he promised he would.

He thinks I am paying for it I guess but I am not Tom Sullivan is. Cabbed ($4) to the office and arrived for the lunch for Sam Spiegel. Sam was charming-he was talking about Carole Bouquet and it turns out that her passport or papers expired. When he sees a pretty face he will do anything and he called a friend in Immigration. All afternoon Catherine and Bob were getting the party list together for that night's dinner at Reginette for Margaret Trudeau. Catherine was trying to get O.J. Simpson but he would left town. At 9:00 Catherine Tom Sullivan and Margaret picked me up to go to Regine's (cab $3.50). When we got there we were so early the photographers had not even gotten there yet. Margaret was just sitting at the bar and if any photographer had come in he would have gotten great pictures but they were not there. Studio 54 is making Regine desperate. Margaret told me how much she loved Tom. And she said that she did not like Tony Portago she did not like his line. And then she told me Tom's line and it sounded exactly the same. Tom's lines were: ""I want to thank Pierre Trudeau for making you such a fascinating woman"" and ""Good night Mrs. Trudeau."" And Tony she said had said ""Margaret Trudeau can I dance with you?"" And that one she did not like. So (laughs) I do not know. And she said that when she was up in Canada this weekend the prime minister who is still her husband said that her interview in Interview was the best she is ever done."

It was such a beautiful day out. It was hard to think about going to work so we went to eat ($15 phone $2 newspapers $2 cab $7.50). did not run into anybody. Nell finally called back and when I asked her to do the TV show she said she would have to check with her partners but I think she just wanted to think about it. I think she is like Ann Magnuson that is why she just has not made it. I mean in show business. they are both the same-at the last minute they get odd and do not want to ""give it away"" but they are not doing anything else anyway. They need more exposure."

He called and said he was having dinner with her up at Elaine's and invited me. When I got there Elaine was jitterbugging with a guy from the bar. Lorna Luft was there.

The kitchen's being put in and it looks so pretty. Stayed there about an hour. Jean Michel Basquiat called from Hawaii and talked a long time. Paige is back here now and she is in seventh heaven overfucked I guess. And now he is flying this other girl out there. Paige was stupid and paid her own way-she insisted because that is the way she is-and now he is paying for this other girl. he is paying $1000 a week for this house. He owes us three months' rent and he is trying to get Bruno to pay. Talked to Paul Morrissey a few times and we are sort of becoming friendly again he was sort of normal. Then cabbed uptown to change into a tuxedo and invited Benjamin to the Michael Jackson party (cab $7). Glued myself together and then cabbed to Halston's ($3) because he would invited me to go in his limousine. So we took the limo to the Museum of Natural History and we got there right as Michael Jackson was getting an award in the center hallway. And he talked and talked it was a new personality. The crowds of kids were kept on the opposite side of the street when we came in that is how it was set up. And there was nobody really there. Just everybody you already knew but nobody. Just all the record-business people but in black tie. Oh and Bob Colacello was there and we finally made up. Because I was drunk. I would had one drink at Halston's and I told Bob how great his Larry Flynt article in Vanity Fair was and he was thrilled I liked it. Oh and the best person at the party who I just love is Truman's niece who now works for Interview as the stylist Kate Harrington is not that the greatest name? Kate Harrington. she is very pretty. Like what Holly Golightly should have looked like. And I just loved her because whatever man she wanted she just went right after them she would give them her card.

Got to the office and worked for three or four hours and then went down to Heiner Friedrich's gallery where they were doing a repeat of Walter de Maria's Dirt show (cab $3). Robert Rosenblum was there with his new baby and he had it with a cloth around it. It was the same show but with new black dirt filling the gallery up. Later sat around at home and worked. Marina called and said to come over and have the food that was piled on her stove the night before gallons and gallons. So I did and it was just the kind of food I wanted-parsnips and leeks and things like that. Walked over there. John Bowes-Lyons was there I brought a present for him because the other night he would said that he was bringing one for me but he must have just done that so I would bring him something because he just had an old tie for me he is so terrible.

Bianca was telling her side of the marriage story. At first she was saying that she never cheated on Mick but then she said he was splitting from her because she had so many affairs-she had one with some guy named Llewellyn and now she is having one with Mark Shand. But she said she never flaunted it publicly. She told me that she wanted to be somebody on her own and that she would always wanted to make it on her own so that (laughs) she could buy any waiter. She said she is giving Mick his divorce and I told her that they should not break up. She said she and Mick hit rock bottom that she can not go to bed with him because she just does not think he is attractive. And she said Mick was ""rude"" putting her down recently she said she is never put him down. She said she could not be ""free""-like a free spirit-with Mick because of who he was and she was a nobody. And she talked about her trip to Hollywood coming up and she talked in that lub-luh-luh voice about her ""role"" in this movie with Tony Curtis and Lionel Stander and Gloria Grahame. She said they were rewriting the part for her that she would told them certain things she wanted. It takes place in Costa Rica. And she is scared because ""the Critics are waiting to tear me down."" And I do not know if she can do it. I mean she tells me she can dance too and then last night I made a point to watch her and she is no Rita Hayworth she is no Rita Hayworth. She was happy because the Daily News finally ran the pictures of her with Liza and Jackie O. from the night before at The Act in it (cab to Studio 54 $3.50). I would given some beads to Jade earlier and Bianca was saying that now this breakup is taking its toll on Jade but Jade looks okay to me.

I was waiting for Jerry Hall to come down to take her picture for a portrait but she was a no-show and she did not call or anything which was strange. she is usually reliable Jerry. I do not know when the baby is due. would not it be awful for Mick if it was another girl? If she has a boy they will get married in a minute I am sure. Talked to Rupert and he gave me an idea-a Statue of Liberty portfolio. Then had to leave and it was snowing by then. Finally got a cab ($4) and then when I got there there was really nobody there.

Victor was there performing cutting up a shirt. Bianca arrived in the dress from Halston's window that Victor had foot-printed. And Catherine was wearing the red outfit that Victor had also foot-printed. Tony Portago and his mother Carroll Portago arrived. Paulette and Carroll are old friends. Bianca wanted poppers but nobody had any. Halston came in with a little painting Elizabeth Taylor had done for me because she did not come down-he would just been with her. When I think about that I am really disappointed-it would have been so great if Liz Taylor had come to the opening. That would have made it something would not it?

But the great and only celebrity was Eddie Fisher and he wasso much fun! He looks young but ugly but he is so much fun! I can see why Carrie Fisher married the Simon guy because he is like Eddie without curls. If I would ever met Eddie in the sixties we would have been best of friends. Now he just does charity work. The first thing he said was ""You did a picture of me."" The one I did in 1962-the newspaper front-page of him and Liz. And I told him about all my crystal doctors and chiropractors and he was really interested and then later as I was leaving the office at 5:00-I had to leave early-he was calling he would looked up the Interview number and so I will call him back. He was so much fun. Anyway back at the thing we went through the store and I only found one box but Kritsick found ten and Eddie found two so I gave him mine to make it three.

Steve Rubell was there and they were supposed to sentence him but they postponed it he said because they want him to testify in court that Hamilton Jordan was at Studio 54 taking coke and he said he would not and Halston said ""But you already said it on TV"" and Steve said ""Yeah but that is not the same as saying it on a Bible"" and I mean I agree-it is not."

Visited each stall had to. One guy painted in Picasso-Chagall style. Not one original style. They sit on the floor and paint on rugs and pillows it looked like hippie streetwares like the sixties. It was the only nicely designed building in Kuwait because it was a copy of the Ford Foundation. Got a tour of the building. The man said it was very Kuwaitian. Picked up at 4:30 for the opening of the exhibition in the Arts Council Hall. We had to meet the minister of state there. I think his name was Ahmad Al-Adwani-have that name written down. But maybe that name goes with someone else. I had sent him a copy of the Philosophy book [see Introduction] and he said he would read it and that it had clever ideas he was old and cute. There was a red ribbon in front of the door I had to carry a pair of gold scissors on a red pillow to cut the ribbon. A lot of TV and press there.

And then the three of them went marching off to look for more stars. We had binoculars. I focused on Rosalynn she looked so sad. Senator Pell gave Ina a seat on the president's platform for the swearing-in.

The place was practically empty by then and she had a Marine with a walkie-talkie next to her. We were actually the only people in the whole building without our own marines.

Bob was upset because The New York Times had called and said they were interested in reprinting Truman's column and Truman has the copyright so Bob is worried that now Truman will start doing it for the Times instead of Interview. But I do not think Truman would. He probably wants to turn them into a book eventually. And Tom Sullivan came by and he was acting crazy. He kept saying that he wanted to give me 25 percent of his business just for nothing. But what is his business? And he kept saying that everybody thinks he made his money in heroin or cocaine but that it was not those two that it was something else. But I mean what else could it be? Marijuana?

When I got home from the office I made a lot of phone calls then walked over to Halston's to pick up Bianca she was cooking like a Puerto Rican and she had the whole house smelled up with onions and hamburgers she had them out on the counter. We cabbed up to 86th Street ($2.75) and we finally hit Saturday Night Fever at the right time and were able to get in. Well the movie was just great. That bridge thing was the best scene-and the lines were great. it is I guess the new kind of fantasy movie you are supposed to stay where you are. The old movies were things like Dead End and you had to get out of the dead end and make it to Park Avenue and now they are telling you that it is better off to stay where you are in Brooklyn-to avoid Park Avenue because it would just make you unhappy. it is about people who would never even think about crossing the bridge that is the fantasy. And they played up Travolta's big solo dance number but then at the end they made the dance number with the girl so nothing so underplayed. They were smart. And New York looked so exciting did not it? The Brooklyn Bridge and New York. Stevie Rubell wants to do a disco movie but I do not think you could do another one this one was so great. But why did not they do it as a play first? What was this first a short story? They should have milked it-done it as a play first and it would have run forever. Bianca fell asleep. Somewhere in the theater we found Dr. Giller. But he had related to the movie so well that he wanted to see it again so we left him there and went back to Halston's. Halston and Bianca were in the kitchen together cooking and he said he had so much energy he wanted to go dancing. He told me lots of gossip-he said that the night before when the doorbell rang it was Liza Minnelli. Her life's very complicated now. Like she was walking down the street with Jack Haley her husband and they would run into Martin Scorsese who she is now having an affair with and Marty confronted her that she was also having an affair with Baryshnikov and Marty said how could she. This is going on with her husband Jack Haley standing there! And Halston said that it was all true and he also said that Jack Haley was not gay. You see? I was right I did not think so. Halston said Jack likes Liza but that what he really goes for is big curvy blonde women. So when the doorbell rang the night before it was Liza in a hat pulled down so nobody would recognize her and she said to Halston ""Give me every drug you have got."" So he gave her a bottle of coke a few sticks of marijuana a Valium four Quaaludes and they were all wrapped in a tiny box and then a little figure in a white hat came up on the stoop and kissed Halston and it was Marty Scorsese he would been hiding around the corner and then he and Liza went off to have their affair on all the drugs. Then Dr. Giller arrived from his second viewing of Saturday Night Fever. Bianca had been fighting with Victor before he came because Victor was eating all the hamburgers she would made and she was saying to save some for Dr. Giller. But I think she just wanted them herself-her ass has gotten really big. The Sex Pistols arrived in the you.S. today. Punk is going to be so big. they are so smart whoever's running their tour because they are starting in Pittsburgh where the kids have nothing to do so they will go really crazy. And Bianca loves Jed. She keeps calling the house but he was off in Connecticut with Judith Hollander and Sandy Brant for his interior decorating business. And they wanted to go out but Halston did not like the way Bianca looked so he put three feathers in her hair. Oh and Victor had just come over to get an extra bottle of Vaseline from upstairs."

David Whitney was telling me that the house on 54th Street where Nelson Rockefeller died was the house he used for having fun. Diana Vreeland was funny the other night she said ""Of course Nelson was with a girl-he was always with a girl. Nelson wanted everyone to be happy. And why not? He was a Rockefeller-he could make everybody happy."" Then somebody said ""But what about Happy?"""

Maximilian Schell came by and the minute he walked in the door Brigid immediately asked him for five autographs and Catherine asked for eight then Chris Makos was snapping away too and poor Max was bombarded. They did need one picture though to go with the interview we were doing. He was calling a girl to meet him down at One Fifth. At dinner at ""21"" Jody Powell was with a girl. The whole idea of the dinner was to interview Joel McCleary but then my tape recorder was doing funny things. I sat next to a girl Lynn who said she and Joel were first sweethearts but that they never got married because he was a hippie and she was a Marxist. It was fascinating to see two hippies who could not make it because they were different kinds of hippies. She said that Joel used to be so skinny but now he is gotten fat but that fat was better for politics that it was better to see a big hunk of man up there. She said her guru told her that if you are a man and you are thin then you turn homosexual and I am thinking I agree with that because of all the models. She said she and Joel meet once a year and tell each other off. So I guess people do do that. I told her that was what the couple does in that Broadway play Same Time Next Year. Lynn said she is involved with that Pillsbury guy's foundation but when I asked her for money she said she is only able to give it (laughs) to ""people in New England."""

I do not know she has no feelings."

And Chris is so cheap-cheap in ways you would never even dream of. And it is like Bob. And Paul Morrissey. They want more and more. And Bob was just back from a grand weekend and he gets these ideas that he should live like royalty and he gets very unhappy if he does not get more and more and I mean he should just marry one of these old bags and get everything he wants (dinner $130).

My lungs are still funny from being shot I guess. Got a lot of invitations to dinner. Talked to Jon and he thought we should work on scripts. He came over and we worked and he left at 9:30. Watched TV and my arm was really aching and that is when I took an aspirin and the last news on TV was that Hans Conried just died.

Had a full day at work. Got to the gallery at 5:00 and then there was only a scattering of people but it got to be more and more and I worked myself to death. The show looked great. Then we went to dinner with Steven Greenberg and then I went home and went to bed early I thought I would shake this cold but then Jean Michel Basquiat called at 3:00 in the morning and I talked to him and it just ruined my sleep. Oh and I have just been watching the new Joan Rivers show a few times and it is just only about sex all the time-so boring.

It was a fashion show at a place called Bill Robinson's Men's Clothes. And the male models were all on pedestals! It looked so great really wonderful and the girls were trying to pick them up and the guys were just on their pedestals staring and underneath them everybody else-was not perfect. And you would go to feel the clothes and your face (laughs) would be right in their crotch. The party was over at 7:30 and the models came down off their pedestals. Met Wilfredo there and we walked up to 61st and Fifth to Fereydoun Hoveyda's art opening at the David Mann Gallery. The wind was so bad really strong and cold. I hope I did not get a cold. Fereydoun was thrilled to see us. His drawings which used to be abstract now look like illustrations for The Arabian Nights. they are representational now. Then cabbed to 57th and Seventh to Earl's ($6). Ahmet was so cool to me. He used to kiss me and tell me stories but the last couple of times he is been really cool like I raved to him about his seven-record-set album and he just listened and then got bored and left. I will have to send him a painting or something. Try to find out what I did wrong. Half the people had just come back from a cruise with Jann Wenner. Talked to Jane his wife who said they would been married nineteen years. And they did just adopt a baby. And Jann is so so so so fat incredible. Fred gave me a ride and I got home at 12:00. And Jean Michel Basquiat had his opening in L.A. and I feel just terrible I forgot to call him.

Went over to Earl McGrath's for the birthday party of Jann Wenner and Sabrina Guinness a double. And Jerry Hall was there she looks just great. She looks like these girls who could marry big Texas millionaires. she is so stupid to have married Mick. Not to have married even. And by the way Fred looks good I wonder if he had a facelift when he was in Europe. it is nothing drastic he just looks rested. If I had a lift though I would go for the really tight-pulled look. I would not care if I could not shut my eyes. Like Monique Van Vooren.

The movie looked so cheap and they made Diana Ross so ugly and they made Michael Jackson ugly. Sidney Lumet must hate women-he photographed them ""up"" you could see right up Lena Horne's nostrils. she is his ex-mother-in-law. The play was a lot better with the Geoffrey Holder dancers."

We went around the exhibit with Paloma she was talking and Lester was being funny and it was exhausting it is three floors. A guy in a wheelchair asked me for my autograph and I said ""do not you want Paloma Picasso's?"" And he said yes so Paloma signed and then I signed and then we had to leave because Paloma had to get back to Tiffany's where they sell her jewelry. Old Mrs. Newhouse came to see the portraits of her husband but her son was with her and he fell in love with the diamond-dust ones. Oh and David Whitney came by we are talking to him about maybe redoing the Jewish Museum show and I am doing a portrait of him because he is been so nice. He brought his tux he really looked cute in it. He invited me to Thursday dinner with Philip Johnson he said he will send a car for me that anyone as big as I am should have a car-he was being funny. Brigid went on a candy binge. She said she was going out for cigarettes but Robyn noticed that she took more money than she would need for cigarettes so when she got back I said ""I see chocolate on your mouth."" I did not really see any but that worked and she admitted she would had ice cream. Glued myself together and went to Cote Basque to help Suzie Frankfurt celebrate-she just got almost a million for her house and she bought a cheaper one. Mr. and Mrs. Law arrived. I think Mrs. Law is Standard Oil rich and I do not know exactly what her husband does maybe he invests her money. that is what usually happens when you marry a rich woman. Or maybe he is rich himself who knows. She wants me to retouch her portrait because now she is made her hair lighter. it will probably turn out to be one of those ""living portraits"" where I have to to keep doing things to it. We went over to Bonds. And John Samuels was there and he is so mean to me now. I think he tries to be nice but he can not help himself he says mean things. I will have to ask him why. We were there for a few minutes. Mr. Law was dancing around and his wife said that he would get a heart attack. Oh and Bob was there and he looked so sour. He feels he can not have fun unless he has a drink. And he and Fred are the same-if there is no princes they look so bored."

Paige was having a big lunch at the 33rd Street building for the black kids from Ralph Cooper's Amateur Night at the Apollo with their mothers and a couple of grandmothers (cab $6). And the kids all had these elaborate names-like Latosha and Emanon-and then the mothers and grandmothers were Grace Mary Ann. And the boy Emanon rapped with noises instead of words. They were all really cute. And it looks like I am going to be painting in the ballroom for now because the basement where I was supposed to be put to paint is now filled up with prints and paintings. Good. I did not want to paint in a dark dump. But eventually we will have to use the ballroom for big lunches and parties. Grabbed Benjamin and we ran uptown and I just threw a bag in and we went right over to the theater where the Muppets Take Manhattan was screening and Frank Oz who wrote and directed the movie-and he does the voice of Miss Piggy and another one too-came over and said ""You will not remember me but I was one of your friends during the Filmmakers' Coop days."" And he said he just loved the Philosophy book. He said he reads it all the time he called it ""gentle."""

Victor came by and he said that Halston wants to meet with me without Paul about Montauk. But we are not making any money off renting it to Halston it just pays the mortgage."

Chris had T-shirts made up with his photographs on them and he gave a shirt to everybody but me he told to go buy one. I could not believe it. And I am looking at these slobs he is giving them to. It was air-conditioned and freezing there. One of Sidney Lumet's daughters either Amy or Jenny sat next to me and she is a spoiled Black Jewish Princess. But she is sweet and I should not put her down but oh God she is so dumb. She was being world-weary. She said ""I did everything when I was thirteen and now I do not even go out anymore"" those kinds of things. But I guess she is likable she tries hard.

People started coming around then and by 6:00 it was jammed. Everybody likes Gael Malkenson who just started working full-time for us now that she graduated from college-she is aggressive and everybody thinks she should really be the one selling ads.

Keith picked me up in red patent-leather shoes and we went to Mr. Chow's (cab $9). Mr. Chow's is fighting having to unionize because he said he needs the kind of young attractive waiters that you just get off the street. I had a glass of champagne. Jed was there with Alan Wanzenberg. And I notice that Jerry's birthday parties have gotten more hardcore every year.

Whitney Tower called and said he wanted to talk about some movie ideas and he invited me for drinks. The rain had started. And then my bell rang and it was Whitney and Averil and Rachel Ward.

John Samuels was at the bar he was going off to Suzie Frankfurt's for dinner-she was giving a dinner for John's father and his boyfriend. Whitney invited me to the Adirondacks. They were up there over the weekend and they said Mick was there diapering a baby and they said he was an expert at it that Bianca never did it and he said he would done Jade all the time.

I got one and Jed got the exact same one and Averil got the exact same one. it is in this little baby handwriting and on flowered notepaper and it says the exact same thing on all of them line for line space for space word for word.

One was ""a beautiful amanuensis."" But she was nice to me she did not put any of the dumb things I said in. Paige came in and talked to me so I guess she is finally not mad at me. You know all these Wall Street businessmen types are always crazy about Paige because they think she can make their lives more glamorous which they are right about-she could. But she is never interested in them -she only likes the young artist types. The drug addicts. And I want to put (laughs) Ann Lambton on the cover of Interview. Everyone just screams at me when I say so but I really do. I think she is going to be a big star and she is really interesting so we would have the first big interview with her. Went to the premiere of Heartburn and when we got there the lady said ""Will you step over to the right for photos?"" And I did and not one person (laughs) took a picture. Except Ron Galella because it was too odd not to so he was being nice. The good scene in the movie was Jack singing ""My Boy Bill."" he is just magic you really want to fall in love with him even though he is old. he is just got it. And the other night when I saw Carl Bernstein I asked him about the movie and he said ""I made them change it all."" But he still comes out a stinker. Then we went to Metropolis to the party. Mike Nichols introduced me to Nora Ephron and she did the early article on Edie for-what would it have been for? The Herald Tribune maybe? She was looking off into the clouds she did not want to talk. She looks the same I was surprised at how good she looks. I had three desserts. Wilfredo dropped me (cab $6)."

And she was wearing the outfit from Stephen Sprouse that I have never seen anybody else wear yet-the shoes glued into the leg stocking. We ran through it and the easiest part is running through our thing for the press that is so easy. They said we had to be back there at 5:30. The whole day was spent being nervous and telling myself that if I could just get good at stuff like this then I could make money that way and I would not have to paint. Then when I went back there at 5:30 we went on and I thought I was going to pass out. I forced myself to think about the next job I could get if I did not. Went along and the drawing came out terrible and I called it ""a masterpiece."" It was a real mess. I said I wanted to be Walt Disney and that if I would had this machine ten years ago I could have made it. Then afterwards people saw the portraits of Debbie and thought those were (laughs) the Xeroxes. And the news is full of Rock Hudson having AIDS in Paris.

Then he will have a white baby with one and then dump her for a black girl right? Went down to meet Grace Jones at the office and we waited for three hours. Benjamin went out and made calls and finally tracked her down at Bergdorf's getting a fur coat out of the Revillon cooler. She spends all her money on fur coats. She says it is all she cares about that she does not care about money just furs. I told her it is crazy that you can not resell them or anything and that she should buy jewelry but she just loves furs. it is that insane. She buys them and stores them all in the cooler. I was taking pictures of Grace for Vogue and we were interviewing her for the cover of Interview. But anyway she was really late and we were putting her down for hours and then suddenly she appeared and it was all ""Oh darling!"" So that would be funny to have all the put-downs in the interview and then show when it all changed when she walked in (Benjamin's phone calls $5). Andre Leon Talley asked Grace if she thought she was white and she said yes. he is just lowkey and good. Sent out for champagne but then we did not have ice. Everything's gone from the office."

Miss USA was actually the best she was from Hawaii and she looked like Jerry Hall but when it came to the question ""What do you think of the United States?"" instead of saying something serious like ""it is the most free nation that glues together everything"" she blew it and she said something like ""Oh I love the beaches!"" Miss South Africa won she looked like a brunette version of Miss USA but she gave a serious answer and Miss Colombia was too stoned to talk. (laughs) No I am only kidding she was not ... but they had around seventy-five girls and most of them were from South American countries you never heard of. The ex-Miss Universe looked really black but maybe it was my TV. I cabbed to the office to pick up Vincent we had to go to a lunch for 600 people at the Plaza given by Gerry Grinberg the head of the North American Watch Company. The paid speakers were Art Buchwald and ex-President Gerald Ford (cab $4). And Mr. Grinberg took me over to see President Ford and he said ""Nice to meet you."" And I told him that he would already met me at the White House and he said ""Oh yes of course."" He looked sort of out of it. I asked him (laughs) how his wife was and he said she was out shopping and I said ""At Halston's?"" and he said (laughs) yes that maybe she was there. But once he got started on his speech he did not seem so out of it at all he remembered the whole speech. It was a good lunch steak and potatoes. And on the way out we went into the Teuscher candy store in the lobby of the Plaza-the one where they fly the candy in every day or something-and I wanted to sell them an ad in Interview but I wound up buying $200 worth of candy instead. I talked to Ronnie. He told me he is now going to one of those halfway houses to stop taking drugs and drinking. He said he had not slept at all in a week. I asked him if he was having trouble with Gigi and he said that well yes that she would thrown the wedding ring out the window. I do not know why she ever got married she is always going to run around and Ronnie wants her to be like his mother in Brooklyn who never leaves the house. Now she is styling or doing makeup on the Brian DePalma movie and that is going to lead to other things so ... Went home and called Truman but there was no answer I should have called before I left for work."

I have been trying to give Chris less work but he came and got all these assignments out of me. And the only reason I got all involved with Chris and Peter and giving them advice is because I thought if they could make their relationship work then there was hope for me. But now Peter is with this bank teller George and Chris is with his new kid Brian and I do not believe in modern marriages. Benjamin and I stopped in Bloomingdale's and the fairies were making the bread in the window-you could see it kneading it and everything.

Backstage there were about fifty nude girls serving hot dogs and beer and mud wrestling. Took pictures then realized I did not have film in the camera. And an absolutely nude girl came over and said ""I see you at St. Vincent's church every Sunday."" The Queen group was really nice to us they gave us drinks. We went to the Palace which is the new discotheque on 14th Street where Luchow's just moved out of. And it was packed packed like a deathtrap firetrap. there is a lot of little rooms I do not know what that means. Got home and talked to Jon in California."

Dropped Vincent (cab $4.50). Suzie Frankfurt said that I had to be at her house there on time at 8:00 because it was a surprise party. Got there at 8:55. Every kid from the office and their date was there. Fred came in and he was really surprised he was shocked. John Samuels was there and he was sweet he invited me out to his father's house on Long Island that used to belong to J.P. Morgan. John Scribner was there and D.D. Ryan. And Eddie Money came with Vitas and Arma Andon. A girl came out of a cake for $500 and it was a big dud. A big nothing-Suzie was complaining about the price. Richard paid. Averil sent a singing telegram. She was there though. She was drunk and tongue-kissing me and she got mad because I would not tongue-kiss her back. The two Frankfurt kids were here. I sat in the kitchen eating good kosher sandwiches. Curley was the real drunk of the party. Diana Vreeland did not come she was too tired. Patti LuPone was there and her brother with his wife he is really good-looking. I tried to tape some of the birthday song but it was too noisy. Jay Johnson and Susan were there and Tom Cashin who is leaving The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas this week. he is going to California to play the role out there. I got fat eating sandwiches.

She said ""When are you going to do my drawing and portrait?"" and I said ""What do you mean?"" And she said ""Well you promised me and I have been the West Coast editor of Interview for seven years now."" And I said ""are not you the West Coast editor because you are social climbing? And are not you getting paid?"" And she said that I told her in the Polo Lounge at the beginning when she first started that I would do her portrait. And I just would never mean that. Maybe I made some joke about it when she was wangling all these free portraits out of other artists but I never said anything serious. So then I just told her point-blank that I was not going to. I mean with art especially I always keep my word and I remember when I say things. And then I called Gael and Gael said ""Listen I do not want to get involved."" So that really upset me. And I do not know whether I get sick because I get mad or get mad because I get sick. And then this kid drops off fifty invitations to this soap opera party at Area that say ""Andy Warhol invites you ..."" and I just got furious. I mean he would called once and asked if he could use my name along with a whole bunch of other names so I said yes just to help Area out and here I am the only name! And I do not do that for anybody so why should I do it for this kid I do not even know? Then I had to go to Sue Etkin's loft for the Curiosity Killed the Cat video that Vincent and Don Munroe were shooting and they had rented a half-block van. The group is staying at the Chelsea and loving it. They were such cute fresh-looking kids. Then cabbed to Mr. Chow's (cab $8) for a dinner with Gael and Paige and Steven Greenberg-he would invited us. And he had this big bruiser Irish guy Bob Mulane there from Bally Casino in Las Vegas and he said he collected autographs like Mini Ha-Ha's and then he said he had Patrick Henry's and he said the quotation ""I regret I have but one life to give for my country"" and after he finished Stuart said ""I have to tell you that was Nathan Hale."" So I (laughs) knew right then it was going badly. I could have it backwards maybe it was the other guy and it was ""Give me liberty or give me death"" but anyway it was Nathan Hale when it should have been Patrick Henry or vice versa. I do not know. Stuart knew. And we were downstairs instead of upstairs and the noise was so loud and I started to feel sick. And I really knew it had gone down wrong when I offered to pay and Steven Greenberg did not stop me (dinner $300)."

She told me Tatum was also going to get her portrait done so that was exciting. Fred decided he would go to L.A. for Madonna's wedding with us. And later on that night Keith told me that he would asked Yoko Ono for $200000. I was shocked. He wanted it for his store. I said ""But Keith you have got enough money"" but he said he did not want to sell his paintings now to get money because he thinks they will be worth more later. And he said she said all her money was tied up that yes she had a lot but that it was not at her fingertips and I was just shocked that he would ask I really was but he seemed to think nothing of it. Ran into Yoko and her boyfriend Sam Havadtoy and went back to the Dakota with them. he is Hungarian it turns out and he is going back to buy a big house there. And he does not let Yoko push him around. He eats sugar and drinks and does not pay attention to her and I guess she wants to be pushed around now. And he was saying that he did not want Sean to be an actor that he felt he should go into something else so he was sounding like a father. I guess he just takes care of Yoko. But that is hard. There were three cats in the apartment and Yoko said that the cats had not talked since John died until she put a record on. And Sam gave us a tour of the place and it is so big. I would never seen all the rooms. The bedroom and everything so I guess they do sleep together. But he is looking for an apartment of his own too so I do not know what that means. Sam made hot chocolate but then nobody sort of wanted it. Sean's away at camp and loves it."

We discussed doing Woody Allen and Charlie Chaplin but we did not know if Chaplin really was Jewish. I went home and then walked over to meet John Fairchild Jr. at Le Relais. Ralph Lauren was there.

And she said that Michael might want to go to an art gallery with me while he is here. She said that they would close the Museum of Modern Art for him so that might be fun. Steve Rubell said (laughs) ""Michael might want to see a little art."" A couple of people called about Bill Pitt-he died. I think maybe he committed suicide. His best friend called and we talked. He thought maybe Bill had gone to a doctor to get a test for AIDS and that maybe he found out he had it and decided to take an overdose. He was not happy. Worked till 7:00. Went to bed at 11:30. I am going to go to a doctor who puts crystals on you and it gives you energy. I asked Dr. Li to recommend one and she gave me a name. Jon's gotten interested in that kind of stuff-he says it gives you ""powers"" and I think it sounds like a good thing to be doing. Health is wealth."

I tried to talk him out of getting it. I told him he was a dog himself. At 4:00 Victor and Rupert picked me up and we walked over to McDonald's to have lunch and hand out Interviews (lunch $9.50). Talked about silkscreening while we cruised. The people in the Village were so unattractive God. They were all the leftovers who did not get taken away to Fire Island for the holiday. Dropped Victor at the Morton Street pier ($4.50).

Ronnie had told me that Rupert was not gay that he lived with a girl so I teased him and said ""What are you wearing that for? Are you a fairy?"" and we all fell over when he said ""Yes I am."" Ronnie's eyes popped out. Suddenly it all started to make sense-the blond hair poofed up the walk the women's clothes-he was gay! Victor called. He said that Halston threw him out accused him of stealing the coke. Victor says Halston keeps most of the coke in the safe but he does not know that Victor can open the safe. He also detected that Victor had had a gang bang because there were greasy handprints on the walls and come on the Ultrasuede."

And they said he was saying that he was one of my superstars but he was never even in one of my movies. Oh wait! My Hustlerl I forgot (laughs) he was the star. He (laughs) was My Hustler. And Jean Stein's going to be on the talk-show circuit probably with Viva. Oh I have got to put the bug in Viva's ear that Jean Stein is just using her."

Had more tea sandwiches. Got some jewelry from Billy Boy to wear to the opening. Then went to the gallery and it was really crowded so I autographed for two hours. Those cute kids were there who want us to do their music video-""Curiosity Killed the Cat."" Chris followed up on them kept calling. Lots of photographers. Then there was a big dinner after that at some old arts club called Cafe Royale where artists would have big openings like Augustus Johns. D'Offay had about a hundred people it must have been expensive. Then Fred took me home. Ordered up tea sandwiches."

I think he must have just gotten the job that Jon was wanting. I do not know if Jon would have been good at it. He never liked any of the projects I thought of but now that he is trying to go into production I am just waiting-I will probably see my ideas being announced as his new projects. Like the ""Music Hotel"" that one I was doing with Maura Moynihan. Jon always thinks it was his idea after the movie comes out. Like Footloose. He knew Dean Pitchford the friend of Peter Allen's and he remembered that they were all talking about it at a party once and then after Dean Pitchford did it as a movie Jon would always say it would been his idea too. But these things are all in the weather and it is whoever does it that counts. They were telling me that Cosima von Bulow cancelled her shoot for Interview because she got a sunburn. But I mean she lives in Newport and she does not know about the sun? Sent Benjamin out on a simple errand and it cost me a thousand dollars! I would given him $2000 to go get the large-size sculpture of the Last Supper that we would bargained the guy down from $5000 to $2000 on. So he went there and it was not there anymore. The Last Supper comes in small medium and large. So then at this other place I would gotten the guy down from $2500 to $1000 for the medium. But Benjamin forgot we would gotten them down and he bought the medium one for $2000! He did not remember! It was actually the size I really wanted anyway but he wound up giving the second store for the medium one what he was supposed to buy the large one for. So this means he has not got a head for figures-a thousand dollars is a lot to waste. I just could not believe it after I would haggled so hard. Went to Marylou's on 9th Street for a models dinner (cab $5). Joey Hunter was there. And all the boy models at one end of the table were desperate that they did not have girlfriends and then the girl models were at the other end of the table tired and complaining that they did not have boyfriends."

Oscar de la Renta and his friend Jack Alexander who does the advertising were there. It was a business lunch to talk him into advertising in Interview. Bob was telling Oscar that young kids do not know about him. Oscar reminded him that Jerry Hall was young and she wore his clothes. And Barbara Allen stopped by and she came and sat down and she made the lunch more interesting. she is going to Maria Niarchos's wedding and she talked Bob into going over for it too. A lady Ivan Karp sent over came to see if she wanted to have her mug done. If you closed your eyes you would think it was Lee Radziwill talking so I guess she went to the same school as Lee and Jackie. She said her original idea was to have Scavullo do a photograph and since that was going to cost $5000 she thought why not go all the way and see about a Warhol portrait. I doubt if she will ever get it done. I think she just wanted something to do for the afternoon. Then Oscar left and Brigid and I rushed out and went to Mays to get some supplies for the office ($11.55 $22.68). It was such a beautiful day. Then rushed back to meet Famous Amos the cookie man. he is good-looking sort of like that black record guy who managed Nico at first-Tom Wilson. But I do think he has chops. His teeth looked too perfect. He does not look good-looking on the package though because the picture makes him look like a pickaninny. He brought his white girlfriend Christina-they live in Hawaii. And he brought his son Gregory about sixteen or seventeen. While we were talking Amos ate some cookies but I am sure he must be so sick of them. I asked why the cookies inside do not look like the ones on the package and he said because it took too long to bake to make them look like that. Ran into Pepe Balderago who said he just does not know what to do with Bill Pitt that he is still flipping out thinking he is God. And so Pepe called Bill's father and said ""Look you are the family you have to put him in the hospital."" I told Pepe to take him to a steambath-in case it was LSD in his system to sweat it out-and then he said he would tried that but Bill would not go in when they got there."

She looks really old but she was great. I do not think the facelift did much for her but then again maybe it did. Averil had invited her mother Sandra Payson and her brother Blair Meyer and John Reinhold was there too. Dropped Vincent (cab $4) and then cabbed with Jed ($4.50) to the opening of Grease. Edd Byrnes came over and said hello and Randal Kleiser the director. It turns out he is the kid who wrote Jed letters from California and then was the assistant assistant director on Heat when Paul and Jed filmed it in L.A. in 1972. Fatso Allan Carr was there. What a butterball-if you pushed him over he would roll. Catherine was there with Stevie Rubell who was cool to me I guess because he read in New York magazine that I was standing in line to get into Xenon which I was not. The movie's great Travolta's so good. In some camera angles he looks like a turtle but with the right ones he looks like the new Rudolph Valentino. Stockard Channing is actually pretty but one side of her face is much better than the other. We walked over to Studio for the Grease party and went in the back door where all the fifties cars were parked and the waiters were siphoning the gas out of the tanks because I guess you are not allowed to bring cars with full gas tanks into buildings. John Philip Law was behind us. They were giving out hair pomade and the place smelled so good-just hot dogs and hamburgers everything from the fifties. Met Mr. Nathan of ""Nathan's"" he and his wife were doing the hot dog stand."

He went up to perform with fifteen girls and him as a drag queen. He still goes in drag. On request. He lip-synchs to records. At 10:00 I had an appointment to do a modeling job for the Jordan Marsh catalogue at Scavullo's. I used my own makeup after reading the AIDS piece in New York. I forgot my lip gloss though. And for the first time in a long time I have not had one pimple. Karen Burke's treatments are working. She gave me this stuff called Ten Percent and it is benzoyl peroxide. Which is what Clearasil is. But then Clearasil has the coloring so I can use it like makeup.

And in the book is a photograph of this totally wrong birth certificate for me. I just do not understand it. For Andrew Warhola and it is from a different city and it says October 29 1930 I think. Where could they have gotten a thing like that? What is it? And with the mother's name blocked out. I do not get it. Was picked up at 6:00 by Chris and Peter for Grease II I was seeing it again. Saw the movie on a smaller screen and it did not hold up. Without the blasting sound from the Ziegfeld I could understand why the critics said it was boring. After it was over I went to Ashton Hawkins's for dinner. Annette Reed and I sort of hit off a conversation. She said she saw Clint Eastwood's movie Firefox at a benefit on Monday at the Museum of Modern Art and that Clint was there and so was his girlfriend Sondra Locke. And after seeing the movie they all went to the Pierre for dinner and she said it would have been so much nicer darling to just have gone to ""some Italian joint with friends."" She said Clint was ""fascinating"" and the movie was ""interesting"" but that she would rather have been with friends darling and let the movie end the experience."

It used to be my bank and it still is sort of because I have a safety-deposit box there which they have not sent me any notices about for a long time. I should see about it. I think it has my deed to the house on Lexington and 89th Street. When I used to go to this bank there was just a teller and now there is lines around the block. Ran into Pat York. Ran into Gene Simmons of Kiss. Ran into an old rep of mine. Eva from Stern sent over the article she wrote and I just could not believe it. I mean I poured out my heart to her and she wrote the kind of rehashed article you know-""Father died in coal mines/Warhola/Carnegie Tech""-and I poured out my heart to her. I actually gave her a good interview because she kept saying she wanted to do something really different. I mean I even toldher that my father was a construction worker and still-""Father died in coal mines."" I mean I only gave it because I liked the guy who has Stern who was so nice to us in Munich. The one who is doing the liquor that'll last till the year 2000. And she did not put in any of the young things that we did. The modern things. I mean we had that great night at the Ritz which was really interesting where she told the kid I was an Andy Warhol double-and she did not even use that. I went to see Janet Sartin and confessed that her treatments were not working that I had eighteen pimples and that I would gone back to my Orentreich methods because he has that stuff that dries them up overnight. Did some Gun drawings and Gun paintings. Oh and I heard that Jed's sister Susan is marrying Mel Brooks's son! I mean if that spoiled girl lands on Easy Street I just will not be able to stand it."

And these clothes they are like costume clothes. Like somebody just drew this stuff and then somehow it got made. Hookers from Harry's Bar wear this kind of stuff it is expensive and you look at it and you know it cost money but you can not figure out who would have designed it. Well now you know- Bernard Perris they are all wearing Bernard Perris. it is sort of like Nolan Miller's stuff like TV clothes. And next to me was Hebe Dorsey she writes for the International Herald Tribune and she raved about Peter Marino. I just love her name. Hee-bee. If I ever have a child I am naming it Hebe.

Chris was picking me up to go to the Whitney show of that artist who we have known for a while the one influenced by me who does the billboardlike Polaroids of faces-I can not think of his name ... Chuck Close. And then we also went to look at the Guglielmi thing downstairs. His wife could never sell his paintings and now here he is at the Whitney with a big show. I wanted to know if she was still alive and I was going to ask somebody who worked there and I ended up giving out Interviews instead. She used to have me to dinner in the fifties she was kind of generous. She lived in the Cafe des Artistes. And then we looked at the forties show and then you think how much better Chuck Close is than the painters in that show. Then we went over to the Port Authority Bus Terminal (cab $6). they are still renovating over there. We went into Walgreen's to photograph some of the real people and then we asked the waitress if we could take pictures and she went to ask the manager and he said yes if we did not show the name ""Walgreen's."" But all we wanted to photograph was this waitress and she had Walgreen's written all over her (Walgreen's $7)."

One said ""there is a fake Mrs. Jagger on the line. Do you want to talk to her?"" I said ""Okay"" but when I said hello the girl hung up. The operators screen every call and they know where you are every minute they do not have to look it up. I mean if the whole world were British it would run so great. London this time was so much fun better than New York in the sixties. But all the great people only were there for these two big weeks of events so ... At lunch we were teasing Bianca that it had somehow made it into the newspaper that Fred was trying to sell her autograph on the King's Road and that nobody had wanted it and she believed us and got upset all over again. Nicky Haslam gave us a memorable party really paid us back for entertaining him in New York. It was at Pat Harmsworth's on Eaton Square. Her husband owns Esquire and Soho News and the Evening Standard. The English girls are so beautiful I do not know how the English made so many aristocratic-looking people. Had a good time talking dirty to Clarissa Baring and talked to a guy who said he invented the waterbed but that now everybody's copied it so he is on to a floating cloud bed. The Gilmans were in town because of Ascot and Sondra was talking about (laughs) ""meeting Elizabeth."" I talked to the widow of Laurence Harvey. Jimmy Connors was cute going around asking every girl if she wanted to go home with him and fuck. Fred keeps on being so peculiar-trying to kiss me and crawl in bed with me so goony. We went over to Nona Gordon Summers's party on Glebe Place. She bought a row of houses behind some other houses and turned it into one big one with a one-way glass roof. I never used to like her but I do now. she is elegant and nice. Her party was for Bob Dylan and Bianca was raving about him and how he is after her. He had his bus parked outside. Nona told him he should buy a painting of mine and he came right out and said he would already had one-the Silver Elvis I gave him-and that he would traded it for a sofa. So what Robbie Robertson told me a few weeks ago was true. And then Dylan said that if I ever gave him another one he would never do it again. He kept introducing me to the girls around him-really beautiful dykey girls who were lying all over Nona's floor. Like Ronee Blakley types. It was sort of like Arabian Nights because that is the kind of house Nona's is. Later on Bianca was complaining that Dylan had wanted to take her in the bus and how insulted she was that he had not gotten a limo for her."

She said that she was thrilled but she would need ""a day to think about it"" so I guess she thinks Bobby might give her a hard time. Later that night I went to the premiere of New York New York and seeing it the second time I fell asleep around ten times. Victor was taking coke in the seat next to me though so that woke me up at the end-a little of it drifted over. Walked over to the Rainbow Room. There was a black guy at the door of the Rainbow Room who did not know me and would not let me in and then another guy came to the door and it turned out to be this guy who always tells me that he wants his lobster pot back. He came to my house with a bunch of people once and says he brought a lobster pot that he cooked in and then he says it is still at my house and I do not ever know what he is talking about. I go crazy every time this guy starts up because it is always the same routine! If he sees me in thirty years it will still be: ""Give me back my lobster pot."" So he came out and said ""Oh come right in Mr. Warhol"" and at first I did not recognize him and as soon as we got in the door he turned on me and said ""where is my lobster pot!"" and I thought Oh this just can not be happening to me again. Oh no oh no no no no no no.... Then the guy had to go back to the door and we got away. We did not go into the main room because I did not know what happened to it I did not see it. We went into the side room and then Julia Scorsese came over and said ""Hold on to me grab me talk to me"" like come here/go there/turn around/do not leave me-she is just like Susan Tyrrell and Sally Kirkland sort of that type. Then she said ""do not look now there is Martin's first wife and I just get crazy when she is around."" And the girl was very beautiful. I did not know that Martin had been married before I was surprised because he is so Catholic and always has the priest around and everything. The girl said ""You do not remember me but I met you when I was the head of the Erotica Gallery."" Then we left her and I introduced Julia to Earl Wilson. I noticed that in the movie were lots of the people who actually work for Marty. Like the woman in the car who has the fight with Bobby and Liza is the wife of the agent. that is why it is good-the parts were written for the people. Julia asked me to sit at the main table with her and Marty but there was a big crowd and noise so I sort of pretended I did not hear that because I wanted to slip away-it was not my night it was their night. Victor left and I was so worried about him he was strange and seemed bored and for the first time since I have known him he seemed real. Like he was very tired and a normal person and wanted to go home. And he did. Went over to Studio 54. The band struck up ""New York New York"" and they carried Liza in. Halston did photos with her. Then a little later they played ""New York New York"" and Martin walked in and I think maybe they carried Liza in again or picked her up again but I was leaving. Dropped Valentine ($3). It was 3:00."

Are the burns getting better or worse? Worked till 6:30. Fred went up by subway to the Mitzi Newhouse Theater where Bob Wilson's play was opening. Curious George. When I got to the theater Fred was there waiting with Katy Jones and her sister. The art-world people were there. The play had water coming from the ceiling clocks on the walls telling you what time it was and striking. It was colored beautifully the set's by Bob Wilson. It took at least two hours and then it was over. The party afterwards was at Leo Castelli's. We were the first ones there. The food was good but Chris Makos said I looked fat and then I looked over at Fred who never eats and stays looking so good so I just had one cucumber and water and I mixed and mingled. The Knowles boy the star of the play sounds so normal when you talk to him you would not know he is autistic. He answers whatever question you ask but I guess the problem is he never says anything if you do not ask him. I talked to Jennifer Jakobson about Mr. Ballato dying. He was in his eighties. He worked at the restaurant till the last minute he loved the business so much. Fred tried to get Katy Jones to leave but she is after Bob Wilson so she did not want to. We all waited for Bob Wilson so we could go in his limo. Richard Weisman was there with Patti LuPone and she was thrilled when I introduced her to Bob Wilson. She got a Tony and she was asking me what she should do with her career and I told her to hang on and stay with Evita for as long as she could because she was the only big star on Broadway and she would become so huge from it. She said yes that I was right. Bob Wilson kept going to the bathroom a lot and coming back depressed. He dropped me and Katy. And as I was getting out of the car he was saying things like ""Take hold of my hand."" And afterwards I pieced it together that when he was saying words like ""Do you think-do you think-"" that he was wanting to know if I thought he was using Christopher Knowles exploiting him by starring him in plays because he is autistic. Got home at 2:00."

I was in and out of the lunch because I was painting with the sponge mop in the back. I have not peed on any canvases this week. This is for the Piss paintings. I told Ronnie not to pee when he gets up in the morning-to try to hold it until he gets to the office because he takes lots of vitamin B so the canvas turns a really pretty color when it is his piss. Answered a few phone calls myself. A couple of cute kids from Sweden came by. Sent Ronnie for photo supplies ($5.95). Cabbed to ""21"" ($5.50). Vincent picked me up. It had just started to rain. Dinner was with Peter Beard and his friend Harry Horn from Kenya. People were streaming upstairs for a dinner that Diane Von Furstenberg was giving for Egon's birthday. I was surprised when I saw Diane's mother-she did not look Jewish she was small and blonde. Then Mick in a lime suit came in with Jerry Hall. I thought things were fishy with Mick and Jerry and then the plot started to thicken. Mick was so out of it that I could tell the waiters were scared he would pass out. His head was so far back and he was singing to himself. The top part of his body was like jelly and the bottom half was tapping 3000 taps a minute. He was putting his sunglasses on and off. Mick started going after Vincent but it was just a ruse because I found out later from Fred he is really passionately in love with Jerry and it looks like there is trouble for Bianca. Jerry was saying ""I really have to go"" and when Peter was going to go with her to get a cab she said ""Oh that is all right Mick will drop me off."" Then we went next door for a continuing party for Egon this one given at New York/New York by Diane de Beauvau. Franco Rossellini was there with a big black and blue nose and you could not see anything but that but I wanted to be discreet in case somebody had hit him so I ignored it until Franco said finally ""By the way have you noticed my nose? My little dog bit me."" He has a dachshund so I got nervous. He took it to a funeral and the dachshund Felix got upset and bit his nose and would not let go."

And at first I pretended that I did not have a sister-in-law because I can not stand her. But then I told him about my nephew Paul who left the priesthood and he told me about his sister who left the convent and now is fucking black guys. I had strawberries dipped in chocolate.

And he told how she tried to seduce William F. Buckley Jr. by asking him for spiritual advice and then when he did not respond she accused him of being queer. If Lee was drinking before this feud with Truman can you imagine now? Oh Truman's making such a fool of himself. He should at least be drunk. Liz Smith called Interview to say that she was going to do an item on the channel 4 news show at 5:45 about our interview with the Mondale kid because of the part where he said that in the vice-president's house where his parents live now when Nelson Rockefeller used to live there he had a trap door put in that connected his bedroom with the guest bedroom. Halston said he was all for Truman that Lee deserved what she got. Then we were talking about Steve Rubell and Halston said that confidentially he thought Steve was going up the river. Then Steve arrived and said his lawyers told him he could get off if he gave evidence to the government about the Washington people that've come to Studio 54 and taken drugs and things.

The guy told Nicky Weymouth he saw a plane crash but later she got on the Concorde anyway although she was shaking and it did not crash. But they all say they are going back to him anyway. How can people go back when they know that what the person said did not happen? Christopher Sykes came by too and he sang the newspaper in falsetto and opera which I have always wanted to do. He sang the story about the girl going to the erotic dentist and another story about a chicken. I told him I would manage him and book him at Reno Sweeney's and Trax but he said he only performs for friends. he is another poor-rich English kid. At Trax Tom Sullivan told Catherine that yes they are boyfriend and girlfriend but that they should not let it show in public because it cramps his style with other girls. Rupert's assistant told me that blonds are not big in the gay world anymore and it is true-it is the hot tamales like Victor who make out now. The new club called Xenon is opening tonight.

She buys modern art and he is out to buy $200 million worth to stock his museum with-like Kuwaiti rugs. Marion Javits was there and she did the funniest thing she said to Bob ""Ask me questions the way a newspaper reporter would and let me see how I would answer."" And so Bob asked her why did she smoke marijuana in public and why does she go to Studio 54. And Marion said ""Because it turns me on."" And Bob said ""But you can not say that Marion.""

And then Vic came and he did not like the idea of Jean Michel Basquiat because in the seventies-I remember reading this in the papers-his apartment had been broken into and vandalized by a graffiti artist. Vic said he still has not gotten the paint off everything yet. And after two hours we still did not know why Vic had wanted to set up this lunch. Then finally Matt started to say something about wanting to do a movie about a sixties underground filmmaker. Matt was wearing pink shoes that he said he got on St. Mark's Place. And he was talking about Midnight Cowboy and imitating the fag in it putting on sort of an affected accent like British or a little like Fred when he is Mrs. Vreeland. And Matt has the ear to be a very good actor. Vic Ramos was the casting person for Midnight Cowboy who put Paul and Jed and Ultra and everybody in the party scene. I was not in it because I was in the hospital it was in the summer of '68 right after I got shot. When I left work it was snowing and raining out. The dog had peed on my bed and I beat him up. Amos.

Bob never wanted the Lumets in the first place and then they pulled out an hour before the dinner and he had to do the seating all over again.

Anita Loos was there and I told her she had a beautiful dress on. she is so tiny I asked her if she went to the children's departments to get the long dresses and she said that they did not have any evening dresses in the children's department that this was a Madame Gres and I asked her if it was half-price because it was so small and she said ""No. I get a fur coat and Kate Smith gets one and we pay the same amount of money."" I asked Anita how the really glamorous women went to bed with men what did they do and she said that the only one she really knew about was somebody out in Hollywood who when the moment would come would kneel down on the floor and pray to God to forgive her and then the guys would get turned off and ashamed of themselves and they would give her jewels.

Meeting rich kids was not anything to me and being invited to her stupid parties. It bothers me because it is not true! The other things I am sure they will be fascinating whether they are true or not but the ""social climbing"" thing just is not true. Oh but why does it bother me so much?

Francois de Menil was there I did not even know it. And in the bedroom they were all taking stuff. And Harry Fane was putting the make on Silvinha or her girlfriend that she was talking to he put on the ""Fuck Me"" look. And Barbara Allen was running around saying who should she go home with. And then just as I was quietly slipping out Richard Weisman saw me and was screaming ""Andy! Andy! Are you leaving?"" And then he wanted to leave too and he does his thing of saying goodbye to everybody just what I did not want to do. And then in the car he said ""Do you think I made a mistake the other night going to bed with Catherine?"" I said ""What?"" I mean I knew that he and Catherine had had sex once a while ago but now here he was saying that they just had it and I mean I can never bring it up to Catherine because it is too embarrassing.

Met Fassbinder and he was wearing outrageous clothes the leopard-skin jodhpurs and one of the guys standing there said he thought Fassbinder had dressed up like that just for me because he usually wears just plain black leather. He looked like a circus trainer. And Brad Davis looks so strange so delicate-looking. Much better than he did on the cover of Interview.

"Tuesday, March 20, 1984","[Gino Piserchio, Henry Mcllhenny, Jill Fuller]",0.014285714285714289,Went home and glued and then walked over to Jill Fuller's house she was having a dinner for Henry Mcllhenny who just sold a $3.9 million Cezanne. The auction house probably did a deal and settled for 2 percent or 1 percent or 5 percent or maybe even no percent just for the prestige of getting the painting. And it was an old evening just old people nobody young. Jill's ex-husband Gino Piserchio one of our sixties superstars was in the kitchen cooking. he is a caterer now. A chef. And Henry's got three stomachs now.

He said ""Get me Candy Bergen!"" And Bob showed me a review that Fran Lebowitz's book got in The New York Times by John Leonard and I can not understand it. Is her writing funny? Some girl we know gave her a long rave in the Sunday Times and now John Leonard and I mean her stuff-all the put-downs and complaining-it is just not my sense of humor. I do not know what is the point. So Bob wanted to prove that other people do not feel like I do about it that she is an asset to Interview."
"Tuesday, March 22, 1977","[Barbara Allen, Edie Vonnegut, Edna O'Brien, Geraldo Rivera, Kurt Vonnegut, Ruth Kligman]",0.07094576719576721,"As I went out the door the phone rang and it was Brigid after all these weeks saying that she wanted me to come over to her mother's right away and see her. So I walked over to 834 Fifth Avenue to Honey and Dick's and Brigid came down the staircase looking gorgeous like a version of Honey. I offered her a job at the office. We talked for twenty minutes about what happened to her ass it just is not there anymore. I told her she should never see Bad because if she did and saw herself that fat and with the farting sounds she would be furious at us. Went to Mortimer's for a party for Edie Vonnegut's picture-drawing that she did of ""Mortimer."" Is there really a Mortimer? And I could not believe the drawings would be that bad. Kurt Vonnegut was there gave a little speech about how talented his daughter was. Remember she was married to Geraldo Rivera? Ruth Kligman kissed me and I did not know what she was doing she started talking all about a love affair she said we had together apologizing for breaking it off kissing me and it was all a fantasy so I thought that if she could do that with me then she would probably never had a love affair with Pollock. She looked good she was in a velvet Halston. Fred's date was Edna O'Brien. Barbara Allen was there. She said that she would wanted to wear the diamond earrings Philip had just given her but that he made her put them in the vault."
"Tuesday, March 24, 1981",[],0.16666666666666666,As Vincent and I were paying bills around 5:30 we heard a couple of bangs but it just sounded like firecrackers but then we looked out at Union Square and there was a dead person on the street it seemed like the police had shot the person and then the TV crews were there and the lights were so bright that we could see the red blood around the corpse from the window.
"Tuesday, March 25, 1986",[Maria Shriver],-0.014062500000000002,Maria Shriver called and postponed until next week because she said she would broken four toes. Went to the Grand Hyatt to the Emmys with Keith. I told them I did not want to say any lines so they announced I had laryngitis and that is why I was not saying anything. But when they announced that some people laughed-they knew. And then this guy who said he was the doctor of the Emmys came and said he would fix my laryngitis so I explained I did not really have any. After this thing was over walked over to the office and there was a lunch going on. Mrs. de Menil was with Iolas there and Fred gave them a tour and he got mad at me because I was not with her enough. Iolas's bags were lost but he says he loves shopping at Alexander's to replace the things.

The paper had me as the big star at Swifty's. Got picked up to go to The Love Boat set. Had to do my ""Hello Mary"" line and the gay director is saying ""Give it some pizzazz-Hel-lo Ma-ry!"" And I say ""Hel-lo Ma-ry."" PH met me there and we sat in the dressing room for a couple of hours while they rearranged the lights or whatever they do. My Stephen Sprouse jackets were there on the wardrobe rack and when I wear them I think I finally look like people want Andy Warhol to look again and now I am thinking I should have worn the silver one the night before to Spago and that when I am out of New York I should forget all this black-tie stuff and just go for flash. Talked with PH about movies and abstract ways to do scripts. Made a phone call to Jon and he said that Shirley MacLaine was trying to call me because she was really upset about the little banner headline on the interview he did with her in the Health issue. It said: ""Metaphysical Madam."" And Jon should not have gone over to her and said ""it is not my fault"" because that is the wrong negative thing to do. She never would have even noticed it or thought about it probably and now she is up in arms. I do not even know why. What does ""Madam"" mean? I mean it is just a regular word. And the introduction I guess Gael wrote and it is just all stuff from other places. Jon wrote one and they did not like it they said it had too much of himself in it-Gael told him ""You are not Arianna Stassinopoulos."" Went back to the Bel Air and had dinner there with Vincent and Andrew Friendly Fred Friendly's son who is trying to sell our TV show. And he talks about his ""lady"" and who in their right mind would talk that way. It was a good dinner and he paid. And Joanna Carson came over to say hello and she is so beautiful. We talked about her son and his career."

"Tuesday, March 27, 1984",[Jean Michel Basquiat],0.10606060606060606,Benjamin did not pick me up because he went directly to the office to help with moving. Jean Michel Basquiat came by and Paige came in at the same time and they had a fight. And Paige has now been kicked out of the apartment she was staying in on West 81st Street the board of the building wanted her out probably because they would see dreadlocked blacks coming in there all the time and they were scared they would not know they were artists. Paige is so charming though I am surprised she could not change their mind. Somebody from the New York Post called asking what was chic and what was un-chic. I guess they wanted someone else to write their article for them.

Noticed Paddy Chayevsky being driven on a little cart to the plane while we walked. Lots of people from the Academy Awards getting on the plane. The first class took up practically half the plane-first time I saw it so full really interesting. John Travolta from Welcome Back Kotter walked by sort of said hi to me sat in front of me. Paddy Chayevsky told the stewardess he wanted to sleep all during the trip not to wake him up but he woke up five minutes after the plane was in the air. John Travolta kept going to the bathroom coming out with his eyes bright red drinking orange juice and liquor in a paper cup and he put his head in a pillow and started crying. I saw him reading a script too so I thought he was acting. Really cute and sensitive-looking very tall comes off looking too fairy-ish like too many people around now but very good-looking. You can see the magic in him. I asked the stewardess why he was crying and she said ""death in the family"" so I thought it was a mother or father until I picked up the paper at home and found out that it was Diana Hyland who'd died of cancer at forty-one soap-opera queen his steady date. Dropped Fred and Todd Brassner (cab $27). Cab fares had gone up."

They were about the same time I think but I wish I knew which was first. Oh the day before Julian Schnabel called and he was in the hospital where his wife just had a baby girl. And he was trying to sound excited. Because everybody really only wants a boy. He already has a girl (supplies $40). And oh I love my Enquirer gift subscription that someone gave me for Christmas. Everything they say is true. But I have to hide them-I am not allowed to have them in the house Jon does not like me to read them. Oh and I do not think I have said yet how odd it was to see Nelson Lyon's name in Time a couple of weeks ago. As if he were a real person! (laughs) Do you know what I mean? When they talk so importantly about someone you know it always looks so fake. Geraldine and I were talking about it. She said ""Nelson will not even talk to anybody now that he is been in Time"" he is going to be a key witness in the Belushi death trial-he was with Belushi and De Niro the night Belushi O.D. would."
"Tuesday, March 30, 1982","[Barbara Allen, Cy Twombly, David Whitney, Sandro Chia]",0.1888573232323232,Christopher wanted to go out looking for ideas. It was a beautiful day. We went to Dubrow's the cafeteria this is in the garment center and they have all the red lights on the food so it all looks so good and everything is oversized and it is full of air. I thought it would be cheap but it was not ($20). Then we only had time to do the bottom floor of Macy's because Chris had an appointment. Talked to Jon he was entertaining Barbara Allen out in LA she is out there with John Samuels. Then there was a gallery opening at the Sperone Westwater Gallery for Cy Twombly. David Whitney and Sandro Chia and a couple of Italian artists were there. Then we went to Odeon. I was next to Si Newhouse who talked about the new Vanity Fair. He just bought a $800000 Jasper Johns. I told him I had some Warrens and Natalies that I would part with.

Her mother's Princess Elisabeth of Yugoslavia. It was a Balducci's lunch it was a good interview. Tom Baker came to say goodbye he is leaving town. I told him about Sylvester Stallone wanting to play Jim Morrison and he said Stallone was too old to do it.
"Tuesday, March 6, 1979","[Jane Forth, Neil Sedaka]",0.08518518518518518,I cabbed down to Union Square and handed out Interviews (cab $4). And then I walked over to the office 1:00. Neil Sedaka arrived and he is just adorable he is great. We had Jane Forth there to do the makeup and little Emerson was with her. Neil posed and it was hard to get a good picture his face is so fat. We worked an hour on it.
"Tuesday, March 6, 1984","[Joan Collins, Michael Jackson]",-0.15446428571428572,Worked on the Michael Jackson Time cover until 8:00. Then watched some terrible TV. I saw Joan Collins in some old movie like Caesar and she was so bad and now she is got the right part and she is so good. It was all just finding the right part.
"Tuesday, March 7, 1978","[Aly Kaiser, Esther Phillips]",0.2389807162534435,"The front page of the Post said that Aly Kaiser was robbed of her jewels last night after she went home from the Liz Taylor party. I am so glad I did not talk jewelry with her like I was going to or I would be a suspect. But she only has the best the simplest and the best. It said the necklace was $500000. What I liked best in the article was that they called her ""a divorcee."" I have not seen that word in years. I wonder if maybe she was picking the guy up-I would not be surprised. Like that night when we all went to her house and the two Negro kids were with us-Esther Phillips and the guy she was with-she did not just have them because they were with us I think she had us because we were with them. But Paulette has to be careful-she is next because rubies are much more in demand now than diamonds. I want to invent a new kind of fast food and I was thinking what about a waffle thing that had the food on one side and the drink on the other-like ham and Coke? You could eat and drink at the same time."

Jamie and Arnold were there. I thanked them for a good time the night before (art supplies $5.85). Jamie said that Nureyev had fallen in love with Erskine and that Erskine had almost given in but did not and that Nureyev's last words (laughs) were ""We can just watch TV."" He gave autographs to Erskine and Catherine. Was picked up by Bob at 8 P.M. cabbed to the Iranian embassy. Bob made me go in black tie but we were the only formal ones and then his excuse was that we were invited to so many parties he did not remember. we are starting to feel used by the Iranians. It started in Washington a couple of weeks ago when we realized that Ambassador Zahedi is not ""in"" now with Carter-he was so Nixon- and Ford-affiliated but now he wants to be in with the Democrats and needs help and that is us. It was a heavy dinner for the Swedish ambassador. Our excuse for leaving early was that we had to go to Francois de Menil's party for Princess Marina of Greece who had an opening at the Iolas Gallery (cab to Francois's on 69th Street $2.25). It was jumping-Arman and Corice Larry Rivers-great party. Gigi was there and she just broke up with Ronnie and went off with Spyro Niarchos and so Ronnie was depressed. Earlier she would been telling me that it was on the rocks for her and Ronnie -she said they have not talked to each other for three months now. he is getting jealous of her making more money and traveling around but he is not ambitious and she is but she says she loves him but that they have to break up because it can not go on. that is the gist of it. Gigi had told me she was going to. Barbara Allen was there with Philip Niarchos they are back in town. Dennis Hopper was supposed to be there but I missed him. he is living with/staying with Caterine Milinaire-they are (laughs) ""together."" Ronnie's friend Tony Shafrazi was there just back from Iran. he is the one who defaced Picasso's painting at the Modern. The ""Guernica."" Hoveyda told us that Sidney Lumet is coming to Paulette's dinner at the embassy next week and we said ""that is nice."" I hear that Sidney Lumet goes around town calling me a racist just because Mandingo was my favorite movie of the year."

At the end she did a serious thing where she broke down and thanked the kids who'd slept in line to get tickets. Jann Wenner was behind me and he said ""What is Bob Colacello doing?"" and then he tried to make it sound intriguing that he had lunch with him. I said ""Why do not you hire him?"" The show was over at 11:30 and I was home at 11:45. did not go to the Club A party for Bette."

Benjamin picked me up and we went to the Calvin Klein fashion show. We were late but they would saved my seat up front (cab $6). Nan Kempner did not say hello probably because she did not invite me to her dinner that night for Jamie Wyeth I guess she was embarrassed. But maybe it was my fault because when you are late you rush in and you do not know who to look at first because everybody's there so you are awkward. And Calvin's stuff was like Perry Ellis with touches of YSL. I guess Marina Schiano puts in her two cents. The colors were all somber. Blacks and greys. It was a beautiful day and I wanted to get out of the office but never did. Jean Michel Basquiat came by and we worked. Went to the Coe Kerr Gallery for the Jamie Wyeth opening. Ran into Lacey Neuhaus and Doug Wick and talked to Ted Kennedy Jr. Jean Kennedy Smith was there and she was nice and smiling. Jamie invited me down to the farm this weekend but I said I had to be packing and moving. Cabbed to the Ritz ($4) with Jon we went in to see the Stephen Sprouse fashion show. It was early but it was mobbed already. My seat was gone so I took Charivari's. Teri Toye the transvestite was in the show. And everybody was saying it was like the sixties. The show was great really the fashion is so good again with these disco kids they have a real look. Like the boys with the straight cut over one eye. So extreme now.
"Tuesday, May 10, 1983","[David Bailey, Robert Lowell, Steve Aronson]",-0.004537037037037043,"Karen the almost-doctor came by and I think I will become her first patient when she gets her office in three months. I am thinking of a facelift but she said to wait and she would give it to me. I never went back to Dr. Rees after that consultation I still owe him $200. Then Steve Aronson came in with a girl named Evgenia she is a Guinness but she has a Polish last name and she is Robert Lowell's stepdaughter-a short dark-haired English girl she is trying to be a model. And we all went to Worth Street just near Canal and I let the girl pay for the cab. Somehow I did not want to somehow I wanted her to. The three of us were being photographed together I did not know why for the English magazine Ritz which I hear David Bailey's sold but it is still hanging on. Somebody was getting something but I could not figure out what was going on. And you could tell the photographer was an amateur because he took too many pictures too many rolls. Left there. Dropped Steve off ($5.50) and then I finally put it together what it was all about. The girl wanted pictures to use in her modeling portfolio and the Ritz wanted pictures of me so she used Steve to get me down there by telling him they needed me to represent (laughs) ""hype"" because they are running an interview with Steve on his book Hype. In the cab Steve said the picture they took of the three of us was going to be on the cover and so then I just looked at him-I mean if it is for the cover they will just crop him out anyway and they will use a picture of me and say ""Mr. Hype."" So that was a real waste of time for everybody but the girl."
"Tuesday, May 11, 1982",[Doc Cox],0.010542929292929288,Got up early did the phones. Had an appointment with Doc Cox walked up there. The receptionist lit into me about how I did not pay my bills on time and how Vincent was so awful when she called and I was starting to tell her off but then I stopped. And Doc Cox could hear everything so I guess he was the one who told her to say those things. And Rosemary is still the big cheese over there. I had an 11:00 appointment but I did not get out until 1:00 or 1:30. The New York Times had a big article about gay cancer and how they do not know what to do with it. That it is epidemic proportions and they say that these kids who have sex all the time have it in their semen and they have already had every kind of disease there is-hepatitis one two and three and mononucleosis and I am worried that I could get it by drinking out of the same glass or just being around these kids who go to the Baths.
"Tuesday, May 12, 1981","[Chris Makos, Doc Cox, Jon Gould]",-0.06874999999999999,Got up at 7:30 and called Chris Makos to discuss the evening before with Jon Gould. I have offered Chris a reward-this one gold watch he wants-if he can talk Jon into doing something with me but even if nothing romantic happens now I still want Jon to move in because then we would see what happens from there. I had a 10:00 appointment with Doc Cox and I decided to get exercise and walk to his office but it was not a good idea I was overwalked and tired by the time I got there. And the Doc did not really care about me. His hair was dyed and he was pudgy and he just wanted to hear gossip. He gave me some salve and then he said I had to get polio tetanus and pneumonia shots and I did not want to I said I would do it some other day but Rosemary grabbed me on the way out and gave them all to me and she said I would not have reactions but I felt funny all day.
"Tuesday, May 14, 1985","[Britt Ekland, Jean Michel Basquiat, Kenny Scharf, Ming Vauze, Stephen Sprouse, Steve Rubell]",0.08312430624930625,"The day of the opening night of the Palladium. The day started off with the problem of Amos being sick. And then the guy painting the roof across the street came over and said mine needed doing. He got my name from the super over there I guess and I gave him the go-ahead to do it and he did it. Then he gave me a bill for $4900. I had not remembered to get an estimate. My fault. Then I get a note from the neighbor saying my roof is now silver and that they just can not stand looking at it. they are telling the right guy right? No silver. Anyway I told him to repaint it and I asked him how much that would be and he says it will take thirty gallons to spray it and it will cost $1200. And he does it in five minutes. Five minutes! I thought it would take hours. And then later he says $1500 and I reminded him that he would said $1200 before. So in the midst of all those problems Benjamin picked me up early and we cabbed to the office ($4) and the place is so big and spread-out I ran up and down stairs up and down and sideways up and down and sideways. that is my life there. that is what I do for a living since we moved there. Keith showed up. We were waiting for Kenny Scharf to call to say if he wanted to go to Stephen Sprouse's to get an outfit but then he went on his own. He got pink Stephen Sprouse low-riders and wore them with a blouse made by his wife Teresa. But I do not think it is attractive seeing the crack in the ass. On girls either. I do not like it really. Then we picked up PH and went down with Keith to the Palladium and went in the back door on 13th Street and the electricians and construction people were working fast. We went up to Steve Rubell's office and the phones were ringing and he was saying ""there is no door list the invitations all were delivered yesterday and there is no list."" And in between people were coming in with the list. Then I left after taping some more for the Party book and taking some pictures. Dropped PH ($5). Went home and glued. Picked Cornelia up and she looked beautiful she got this idea to wear a long braid and she looked like Britt Ekland or something (cab $6). And Halston came out for this that was a big thing. So anyway we went in and stood in a couple of places. And Benjamin was there as Ming Vauze in a grape-colored strapless with a tulle skirt. And Beauregard who writes for Details was in drag too. Boy George was there with Marilyn who is always obnoxious she had a camera. Eric and Shawn from Area were there looking glum. Chris in a striped outfit was there he was complaining that the drinks were not free but Cornelia was getting the Cristal from Dan Steve's driver from New Hampshire who is now the ""general manager"" there but I do not think that is going to work out because he is too nice he will never be the type to manage a place. And Jean Michel Basquiat was in a dark mood. he would bought Jennifer a dress to wear to the opening and then he did not even bring her he left her home. And I did not lecture him about the heroin he takes because I did not want to have a fight. And I am worried about Ming turning into an alcoholic because I saw what happened with Curley-it starts very happy and lots of fun but it does not end up that way. And the Palladium I do not know it was good for opening night but they are going to have to have the bridge and tunnel people in there all the time to fill it up. And if it is a success then we will know there is no recession. And the funny thing about putting art in a disco is that in the end when you pack all the people in it does not make a bit of difference. It really does not. You do not even see things. And like that Saturday Night Fever ""discotheque room"" they have-when it filled up you could not even see what it was supposed to be it is just all bodies dancing and you do not notice what anything is. So Steve Rubell really has a story now jail and then the Big Comeback. ""I never lost faith"" he says. But he lost hair. Left at 2:30."
"Tuesday, May 16, 1978","[Bella Abzug, Joe Armstrong]",0.18955342902711325,"Cab to the Olympic Tower ($3.25). Halston had designed uniforms for the Girl Scout troop leaders. So many ladies pounced on me. I said that Halston must be making a bundle on this but it turned out he did it all for free. it is a great way for these ladies to get a Halston for cheap-pants are only $25. He did them in a funny color green-it is not my favorite green-but then all the ladies wearing it did look pretty. Then we had to leave we were going to the tenth New York magazine anniversary party at Citicorp Center that the editor Joe Armstrong had called and invited us to. It was jammed. Joe Armstrong met us he said they would just had a fire in that big furniture store on the ground floor there. Bella Abzug was there she said she was on a diet but she was tasting everything that came her way. The owners of Plato's Retreat came over and invited us both to Plato's. The man said ""Come and just hang out for an hour or so have a drink."" And the girl said ""The vibrations are so beautiful you will not believe the things you will see."" So I said ""Come on Bella. we are a couple -what are we waiting for?"" And Bella called her husband over and said ""Martin Andy just invited me to Plato's."" And Martin said something like ""Go ahead Bella. Enjoy!"" But Bella said she did not think it would look good in the papers."
"Tuesday, May 18, 1982",[Steven Spielberg],-0.3475,I tried to get some background information on Steven Spielberg for the interview with him. I decided not to be mad at the horrible P.R. girl who would not let me into the screening of E.T. the other night. She sent orchids to apologize and it is stupid to keep thinking about things like that.
"Tuesday, May 21, 1985","[Keith Haring, Stephen Sprouse]",0.02636800334168755,"My day started off with destruction. I picked up this rug and the moths had eaten it right through. they are all in the back. I am going to spread more moth stuff. So far they only got an Indian rug but they could eventually get to my Stephen Sprouse things. Benjamin came and we decided to walk down Madison to the office. We did not have any Interviews. Rupert arrived at 6:30 and worked a little. His boyfriend picked him up in Rupert's Rolls Royce he was out there waiting like a nagging wife I guess Rupert wants that though. Poor Rupert is henpecked. And I am just waiting for them to have the big fight. The guy is taking him for a ride. So there he was waiting in this grand left-side-driving Rolls. And they gave me a ride home because it was raining and hard to get a cab. And during the day I bought lots of newspapers for the front pages-they had the sextuplets on ($2). And People magazine has the article on the artists and it has ""Andy Warhol fifty-eight."" And then ""Keith Haring twenty-two."" So if anybody asks just tell them I am eighty. Always ""he is eighty."""

I called the elevator man and told him about a spark I saw but he said the spark's always there that it happens all the time. Then since I had to go to the Doc's at 3:00 I could not eat because I was going to have tests. But we wandered around and I had a lot of energy because of the vitamins. Jean Michel Basquiat came down to the office early. He was reading his big review in the Voice. They called him the most promising artist on the scene. And at least they did not mention me and say he should not be hanging around with me the way the New York Times thing did. I opened up one of the boxes in the back that is being moved and it had 16mm rolls of film and letters from Ray Johnson the artist and I think my bloodstained clothes from when I was shot. I realized that the reason Tony Shafrazi has not gotten even one of the artists in his gallery into MOMA is because Tony's the person who defaced Picasso's ""Guernica."" But that is not fair. Keith Haring is not at MOMA. And they just have one thing of mine the little Marilyn. I just hate that. That bothers me. Then in the afternoon I went to Doc Cox's (cab $7) and I protested over the thermometer that they used because it just sits there in water and everybody uses it it is not right. And Rosemary took my blood pressure but I have the feeling they just throw these tests out. Bubbles was tan. And they have a new heart machine so now I do not have to run up and down the stairs in the hallway (laughs) to get my heart going-it is a big improvement. And Freddy will not take your blood if she does not know you. We went to meet Paige and Benjamin ($4). And after dinner ($120) at Hisae and drinks at Jezebel's ($30) we went over to Stuart Pivar's because he was having people over and I wanted to learn about art. I brought a small bronze with me that I just bought three inches and Stuart said it was a piece of junk so tomorrow I am returning it. I had it on consignment. And did I tell the Diary that Benjamin and I ran into Virginia Dwan and her daughter who is married to Anton Perrich who did all those videos and rented our old floor at 33 Union Square West when we moved out. They said Anton was home with his painting machine and I was so jealous. My dream. To have a machine that could paint while you are away. But they said he had to be there while it painted because (laughs) it clogs up. is not that funny?"

She was in a T-shirt and shorts and she looked cute. I invited her in for the lunch but she said she had too much work to do she is working four hours a day-she gets things done very quickly. I went over to 927 Fifth Avenue to the Zilkhas' dinner for the people who own Dior. It was sweet of Cecile Zilkha to invite me because it was really a heavy-duty dinner. Happy Rockefeller was happy to see me. I should have talked to her a lot. Annette Reed had a fifty-carat sapphire on a diamond necklace that was about two inches wide. She was dressed beautifully. she is a sister of the Sophie Englehard girl who is Jane Holzer's friend the one who is with the black football player who I met in Washington. The ladies were all statuesque. Dina Merrill was with her husband Cliff Robertson. Alex Liberman was there with his wife Tatiana. Carolina Herrera was there and I would brought the new issue of Interview and she stole it because her picture was in it. All the fairies were there. And it was old-fashioned kind of living. If this style of living goes on it will be incredible. How can it last? The first course was crab meat in tomato aspic and you do not see things like that anymore. And then the chicken with fresh cranberries and rice with nuts and chocolate mousse with hard crumbled cake and good wine all served so beautifully. And flower arrangements up to the ceiling. Bill Blass was there and Pat Buckley in Bill Blass. But everybody looked so old. But then I guess I fit in. But it is funny they would think to invite me. I am looking very good now I could have any of these old bags. I should go after Yoko Ono but I would probably do it at the wrong time-just when she would just found somebody I would call her. I got home to no phone call from California.

Worked until 6:45 and then all the dishes from the lunch were still in the kitchen and I told Fred that the kitchen was dirty and he looked at me and said ""Well I am not going to do the dishes."" Diana Vreeland has been really a bad influence on him. I should have broken that up. In the old days Fred would have been the first person to roll up his sleeves and start scrubbing. I had already called for a car so I just had time to clean the coffeepot and I guess Jay cleaned up the rest. Jay's in a good mood lately. Maybe he has a new girlfriend. Thomas Ammann saw Jay's art and loved it but that was a one-time painting-he is not painting like that now. The young artists are all now doing abstract paintings because they are making fun of that now. they are going through everything making fun of every period. Went to see Martha Graham with Jane Holzer and Halston. Halston did the costumes. They did ballets from like 1906 and 1930 and it was funny to see what dancers were like then-they were like hoochy-koochy girls. (laughs) Ballet needs a new defector-you watch these Russian dancers and we do not have anything like that here. I was watching a Russian group do ""Swan Lake"" and it was just such a difference."

Then when he came they said they did not have a table and we got mad and left in a huff and we were going to go to Pearl's but then we went to Raga and we go in and there is a ""hostess"" who thinks she is so grand and there is absolutely nobody in the place-eighteen empty tables and she is putting on these grand airs like a drag queen or something floating around with these sleeves. And she takes a phone call and has us stand there waiting as if the phone call is more important. So we ate and it was really expensive for just what was going to be a run-in-quick lunch ($125 and I did not tip much either). ""Yes we may have a table for you....""I mean what are these people thinking about? Left there cabbed to meet Lidija ($6). Jean Michel Basquiat was there he would gotten pizza but then did not want it. Then we painted an African masterpiece together. One hundred feet long. he is better than I am though.

Francois looked heavier and happier. He told us his mother was starting a museum that she was giving $5 million. God it is so incredible to have that much money it is so abstract. You just sit there and try to think of how to be creative with it. We stayed there until 8:30. I began watching The Valachi Papers on TV with Charles Bronson and then I fell asleep and then I woke up and ran to the window when I heard a voice say ""Open up it is the narcotics squad"" and then I realized it was on the TV. It was scary to think that when you dream you are dreaming what is on TV and it is so real. I really thought the narcotics squad was right there."

Bianca had a small but beautiful suite with a terrace facing the courtyard filled with geraniums and red umbrellas. Read an English newspaper. Ate an orange that was there while we waited. She was looking all over for her Faberge amethyst and when she could not find it she said she could not do the interview with us and she ran out to Castel's to crawl on her hands and knees looking for it-she thought she lost it there the night before. Bettina was the first to arrive for lunch so we interviewed her. She works for Ungaro now. She was wearing a Bulgari snake watch and white Ungaro suit. Then Ungaro finally arrived. He was wearing a white suit too. Then went to his place. Princess Grace and Caroline of Monaco ran out of Ungaro Couture when they heard we were next door at Ungaro Homme. Bob bought a suit. Then we went to the Rue Beaubourg for my Hammer & Sickle opening at the Galerie Daniel Templon. All the same punks were there plus Sao Schlumberger in a blue Givenchy. She was on her way to Florence Van der Kemp's dinner in Versailles. Barbara Allen came early and told us all her own gossip-she and Philip Niarchos had a big fight last night. He accused her of having affairs with Jack Warren and Mick. She did not deny it even though she says she has not. He admitted to her his affair with Manuela Papatakis in the south of France plus one other plus three hookers. In three weeks. They made a pact that when they are together they are ""together"" but when they are not they are ""not."" Some punks had a fight and a tooth got knocked out. They started screaming my name loudly so I was locked into the office. Then it was time to leave for dinner. On the way out a drunk creep kissed me smack on the lips and I almost fainted. Oh and Bianca was in a great mood because they would found her amethyst. She had threatened to bring in private detectives. So they questioned the help-they have all worked there for years- and the oldest man was the one who'd found it when he cleaned up and kept it."

Peter Wise told me that I should get a bulletproof vest that he knew where you could get them. I was a chatterbox because I was nervous. Went down to 11th and University Place to a funny shop on the second floor (cab $6). Peter had called Christopher to meet me there and take photographs. I bought a bulletproof vest ($270). The guy was really creepy he said his business had really soared after the Reagan thing. He had dresses and coats and everything bulletproof and there was a sports jacket I asked him to hold for me that I would come back and pick up and it seems really warm for winter too. We asked him what else he had and he said he would not say in front of the media because a journalist from Stern came there with us so Christopher can not wait to go back there to see what he is got that he would not say. Then Christopher had his bike downstairs but I could not even get on it with my backpack. I called Jay Shriver at the office and he came to meet me around the back of the building. Went up in the freight elevator. Then it was the busiest day ever. The cop we rented could not believe all the freaks we have up there. And there is always some new girl at Interview who will buzz anybody in. I called Jon at Paramount he was in meetings. Bob did not come down to the office. Brigid's jealous because I have lost all this weight but she looks better with her face filled in a little. She got rid of her cat Billy because he was sick with a virus so she is heartless and cruel. I told her ""you are no good."" And she just says she does not want to talk about it she is waiting for a new cat to come in at the store. Jackie Curtis came up and she just has dyed hair but short. he would been to Gstaad and had a really handsome boyfriend with her I do not know how she does it and she is fat and smelled of liquor and she was limping so it was really pathetic. She brought me a shopping bag. [Note: when Andy talked about men who wore women's clothes or makeup he would randomly refer to them as ""he"" or ""she.""] Oh and that guy at that shop said he made a bulletproof raincoat for the pope. And disguises do not seem to work for me-I am going to get a fisherman's hat tomorrow. I think that is the best like Mr. Winters used to wear. Picked up Jon on the corner of 18th between Eighth and Ninth and we went to Chris Makos's on Waverly Place (cab $9). Found a Citibank machine and Jon used it and I have never done one before and it is so exciting it asks you questions."

John Fairchild was twenty minutes late and they held the show for him. It was great to read in Page Six that Jerry Della Femina's ad agency did a Perry Ellis ad and the boy model was reading a book and there was the word ""fuck"" and Fairchild would not run it in WWD and Della Femina said something like ""Who does John Fairchild think he is? He may be able to push Jerry Zipkin and all the other walkers around but not the ad agencies."" So that was kind of great hearing Fairchild get told off. I thought the show was like mild Halston with the sweaters tied around the shoulders and things like that coats and hats and pants and all lengths but Fred said it was ""Rich Wasp."" Tried to get work done (cab $4). Bruno had left candy for me and it was all I could think about sitting there so I ate it and it gave me energy. Rupert came up and he still has the same cough but he said his psychiatrist says it is just a way of hanging on to the boyfriend who died."

And there is a big fake of mine there but I would signed it. I do not know why I ever did. But it was Peter Gidal's and he would done that book on me so I wanted to be nice once and I would signed it for him. it is four Jackies and I never put them together in a print I do not think. No my Jackies were all separate. And then we left there and passed Regine's and Benjamin nudged me because Paul Anka was saying hello and I did not recognize him. he is so suntanned. And Benjamin knew I did his portrait so he poked me. I just saw clips of him when he was young on TV this morning. He looks a lot better now than he did then-he must have had a lot done. Jean Michel Basquiat came up and was so paranoid he smokes so much marijuana and then gets paranoid. Then he called me up in the middle of the night and said that his painting at auction went for $19000. I bet mine went for nothing. Probably. My Liz. Probably $10000. I can just see it. So his went for $19000. And there were all these parties for the Museum of Modern Art and I was invited to all of them but I did not go to any of them. Dropped Benjamin ($6.50).

Then she finally called back and said that David Bowie was busy and could not have lunch but that we should do it tomorrow. So I guess she was not mad. And Chris Makos called about the interview with the psychiatrist who is doing a book on famous people's IQs and he wants to give me the IQ test but I have decided I am not going to take it. I mean why should I let anyone know how stupid I am. And the release this guy sent was too much-it practically said he would own my brain cells. So now Chris is mad at me for backing out. And have I said that I met a boy at Studio 54 who told me that he had an affair with Vladimir Horowitz? I said ""How could a seventy-nine-year-old man get it up?"" I just do not believe it. And Doc Cox called for me he is been calling for a couple of months saying he is giving a party for me and asking for my list of people and then suddenly he said ""Do you mind if it is also a party for Larry Rivers?"" is not that odd? Does that mean he is mad at me? Larry's out of the hospital he would had heart palpitations again. And today they found Aldo Moro's body dead in Italy."

Lucie and Desi Arnaz Jr. called-I would seen them at a party the other night-and I have not returned their call yet. I dropped Catherine (cab $4).

And now Jean Michel Basquiat has this blonde WASP girl that he is fucking. I think he hates all white women. And Cornelia's taken my scarf. She always goes out with no clothes on and see-through dresses and then she complains she is too cold. So she took the great red scarf that I got at a fashion show so that is the end of that.

Truman may be on Lithium because suddenly he is happy. But my real theory is that he went out to Long Island and saw Jack Dunphy and that Jack Dunphy finally agreed to write Answered Prayers for him. And he had the most chic coat on. Courreges. One big zipper and two zippers for the pockets. He said it was a few years old. But his hands are cold. Which drug is that? I worked at the office until 7:30. Rupert was helping me try to paint with a brush the piss on the brush but it was hard. Dropped Rupert ($4).

Had a martini with a little vodka. I needed it for courage because the people were so highfalutin'. Prince and Princess Michael of Kent arrived and they were really classy. She had on a little hat and a big dress and she explained that she was pregnant-she was friendly to me. She showed me a picture of her eighteen-month-old baby. The prince had on a well-cut suit-the English know how to give you a new body with a suit putting the stuff in all the right places. Left there and went down to work. I would asked John Reinhold to be my dinner date so he picked me up (cab $5). Downstairs at the Italian Pavilion. Joe MacDonald was trying to slip out because he said he had ""a fuck date."" We finished dinner at 12:00 (cab $4.50). After I got home John called and said his wife was not home that this was the first time that would ever happened.

But then it was not Stuart and he was still trying to use a key to get in. I decided to open the door and see who he was and so I did and I think he was drunk or something. He asked for the lady of the house a few times and I kept telling him that I was the lady of the house. And then I went back inside and the phone rang and it was Stuart to tell me that there was a man on my doorstep trying to get in and I told him I knew and then Stuart came to pick me up again and I went out to the car and past the man who was still there and I got into the limo and Stuart was crying. Literally crying. The tears were streaming down his face. It was shocking just absolutely shocking. I said ""It was so odd I thought he was you at first."" And Stuart was sobbing saying what if it were him and how could I just leave him there? And I said ""Well I think he is drunk and what can I do anyway?"" So he said to take him somewhere put him in a cab and get him where he was going but how could you know where he was going? So I borrowed $20 from Stuart and gave it to a cabdriver to take him where he was going but he probably just dumped him in another neighborhood. But he was well-dressed. Like a Spanish man in cream-colored Spanish boots and kind of natty. By the way Michael Jackson never did show up he called and cancelled right before he was supposed to be there."

We left and I told Benjamin I would had my fame fix for the day. We went to 47th Street and got hustled into some silver junk. Benjamin got a piece himself actually-it is only the second time that is happened. He saw it and wanted it first. I should have gotten it for him but it was too awkward. I remember when I was with John Lennon and he was buying thousands of dollars' worth of clothes and did not say ""Do you want a shirt?"" Years ago. And I have found more Polaroids of him and Yoko Ono only I did that thing that Brigid did I glued them onto wood and they wrinkled.

And then Thomas called Barbara Allen and she was with Taki Theodoracopulos so they came. The Palace had a crocheted curtain in the window it looked like a place that gave palm readings. We were the only ones in the place but there were about eighteen people running around to serve. The look was like going to the tackiest person's apartment who is trying to put on the dog. Like going to Barbra Streisand's house. West Side taste. Every table was under a chandelier and the dishes had gold trim on them that kind of thing. But the food was good. There were eight courses. The bill came to $914 and I think it shocked Thomas. I really think he was really shocked. Because after he saw the bill he stopped making fun of the meal.

I worked painted for a while and then after Vincent had had time to set up went over to Larry Rivers's where Vincent was videotaping (cab $5). And Larry gave a good interview. It was weird he said he had his eyes lifted and that he would had a scar removed and I just could not believe it I said ""Well then why did not you get your nose done?"" And he said because it would have changed his character! And Larry was talking about getting old and I told him to just not think that way. He said he had to sleep with John Bernard Myers to get shown in his gallery and gee he is done so much he was Frank O'Hara's boyfriend too. Larry gave us a good video interview but now I have to do one for him in return. Larry's strange he is sort of a good artist but such a nutty person. Then decided to have Thanksgiving dinner at home two days early because all my friends are leaving town on Thanksgiving day. I told Jon and Christopher and Peter to come at 8:00. Peter makes the best pies. And we played Christmas tapes and we overate. And then we went upstairs and Chris pushed the furniture around and we played Charades. And then around 10:30 we decided to go to Studio 54 for Bob's party for Sao and we found a parking space and got there before Bob and Sao and I went on the dance floor and danced every dance and the reason I have now just begun to dance is because I finally realized that nobody really notices you. I mean I watched Jon go out there and jump and bounce and I thought Well I can do that too. it is one thing I have picked up from him I might as well get something out of it. So now I will be dancing. And then I heard that Jed was there so I guess he saw me dancing. He could have gotten me dancing all those years that is something he could have done for me. And I was not drunk at all either. I was just miserable because things do not turn out like you expect them to I was in sort of a horrible mood. I had a sip of champagne that is all. And then I danced with Gaetana and with Sao and with PH and I just never knew I could do it before."

Oh and Stuart told me I am the only one who talks to all the black guys who work at the auction houses asking them what they think of the things (laughs) Went back to the office and worked from 6-9:00 and everybody else was working late too. Fred's walking with a cane. Then invited Paige and Rupert to Nippon. it is nice not to have Sam to worry about anymore.

It was the worst start imaginable. I was up at 7:00 ready at 8:00. I called Fred and he was just out of it. It drove me crazy. He was rambling. Maybe he would just slept for fifteen minutes I do not know. Anyway an hour later we were in Washington. Went to the Madison Hotel. Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia came with us. Her daughter Catherine Oxenberg starts on Dynasty next week and she was coming down later. And then some of the people went off to the White House but we were not invited so we stayed in our rooms. So we ordered lunch and that was expensive. Jean Michel Basquiat ordered a '66 Chateau Latour wine for $200 (lunch $500). Then we limoed to the Sequoia the presidential yacht and it was cold and miserable and getting dark. Same old people. Peter Max and his girlfriend who is so beautiful tall and Texan and I do not know why she is with him. She was at the beginning and ending of Heaven's Gate. A top model I forget her name. I talked to Chip Carter while I was there. Then we went back to the hotel and Jean Michel Basquiat rolled a joint. Then we ordered dinner which was disgusting (tip $5). Fred did not realize that he had only yellow socks and brown shoes so he could not wear his black suit. Entertainment Tonight got me on the way in and asked me who I voted for and I said ""For the winner"" and they said ""who is that?"" and I said ""The winner is the winner."" I do not even know what I meant. If they ever put all the clips they have ever gotten of me together they would see that I am a moron and finally stop asking me questions. I took pictures of Melvin Laird dancing. Jean Michel Basquiat was so hard to deal with he gets so paranoid. This was a ""Non-partisan Party"" that the Weismans were having because at the last election they gave a party for the Democrats and this time everybody was a Democrat but pretending to be a Republican."

Catherine called and wanted to do something. We stayed at the office until 6:30 or 6:45 and then went up to 725 Fifth Avenue to the Robert Miller Gallery for Juan Hamilton's opening there (cab $4). And just when I got there a guy came in and served Juan papers. It was charges from the woman that used to work for Georgia O'Keeffe for years saying that he was conspiring to get all Georgia's paintings. I left Rupert on 66th and went home and glued. I would invited the Hoveydas out things are so bad in Iran and the du Pont girl and Paul Jenkins. And then Bob invited Lily Auchincloss-her husband Douglas just left her for Kay Kay Larkin. We went over to Quo Vadis. Hoveyda got a phone call and they told him that the phone lines from Iran to Paris and New York were out and the Shah's put the military out stronger. The Hoveydas looked worried. Then around the corner we saw Truman. He was fixing Barbara Allen up with a millionaire. I think it was actually his Jewish lawyer or something. And Truman is a completely different person from last week. Do you think they have found a new drug to give him? Really this week he is so dapper and last week he was an alcoholic.

He was in a nervous mood and when he saw that I was doing a new style of painting he got upset he did not like it that I did the Chrissie Evert in lots of little pictures instead of the big ones but then he saw that the Newsweek girl who was there interviewing me loved it so then he kept calling me back all day to say he was sorry. At Richard's party later for Vitas Gerulaitis Margaret Trudeau was there with two girlfriends from Canada. One was just divorced and she had three kids and she was fat and big and looked older than Margaret because she was fatter and she decided to put the make on me-she came over and put her hands on her hips and gave me the best lines I mean you really could fall for it! Nobody's ever said anything like it to me just the right thing something like: ""You are so much more than I ever expected!"" I told her that Margaret should go back to her husband and go into politics and she was thrilled to hear that that is what she thinks. She had a beautiful stole on in that deep purple color-""aubergine"" is it? They always say it in the fashion shows and I never know what it is. Lacey Neuhaus was there with Francois de Menil and she said that she just met the number-one cowboy in the world and she was going to interview him for Interview. Frank Gifford was there with a woman maybe his girlfriend maybe his wife-she had so much makeup on lots of white all over her face and lots of eyeliner but very beautiful. He loved his painting. The owner of the Giants was there."

We got there and our table was actually reserved for Bette Midler. Saw Isabelle Adjani so beautiful. Bette came in and got an ovation. She saw me and made me kiss her hand. Told her we just missed her in Copenhagen she said she knew all about it. I tried to talk to her but she reminds me too much of Fran Lebowitz-like she is afraid you will steal her material. We just do not hit it off. Valentino was there and he and Bette chatted she asked him how the shmatta trade was and what did Jackie O. buy and she wanted four of them and what was the new look. She gives everybody the Sophie Tucker answers. Then she left and the party kept going on.

Ran into Kenny Jay Lane who is put his whole house and furnishings up for auction-now that he is getting divorced from Nicky Weymouth he can present it as something he is doing ""for the settlement."" When you see all his junk together it really looks bad. Went to Chembank ($4). Steve Aronson was at 860 looking around he had a beautiful girl with him. He says he can not start editing Popism until next week. Vincent was off in Montauk checking on the place-Jay Johnson and Tom Cashin are still out there roofing and repairing. By closing time Vincent still was not back so I locked the place up myself. And when it is my responsibility I get so nervous I do things like pull out the plugs to the Xerox machines so they will not start a spontaneous combustion; I decided I would risk leaving the refrigerator on. When I got home there was a message from Barry Landau somehow he would gotten my number. So now the three worst people to have your unlisted number have mine-Bob Weiner Steve Rubell and Barry Landau. Lester Persky called and invited me to a screening of Equus. I loved Peter Firth he was wonderful and Richard Burton was wonderful. The movie has the longest nudity. Usually when they photograph a cock they make it fall in the shadows and the shadows always fall where the cock is. But in this movie the cock always falls right where you can see it. Peter Firth's dick gets in the way when he moves. it is the biggest cock on screen and not circumcised. As big as Joe Dallesandro's. Peter Firth came over to me he would imported a girl from England for all the publicity and she was there and we had a good time. There was lots of food but I would already eaten. Then Peter Firth wanted to take the girl dancing so we walked over to Studio 54 for the Elton John thing. Stevie invited us all up to the booth where Michael Jackson was and Michael was sweet-in his high voice he asked me about art. David Hockney was there. The photographers were there and wanted Elton John and me to pose for pictures together so I asked Elton if I could kiss him but he did not answer me so I did not. Maybe he did not hear me. He was wearing a hat because of his hair transplant. In order to get out of Studio 54 alone I had to avoid all the boys I have been accepting rides and dates from lately. I had to look nervous and run around so no one would follow me-you know the ""frantic"" technique."

I was wearing (laughs) ""Essence of France""-b.o. There was a strange picture of Mayor Koch in the paper sneering at Nixon at the Cardinal Cooke funeral. It was a weird picture (cab $6). Met Lidija. Had a lot of coffee. Worked till 7:00 or 7:30. Ronnie Cutrone came by and said that he was in Milan when we were and that Jean Michel Basquiat went off to Madrid. Jean Michel Basquiat's trying to get so famous so fast and if it works he will have it I guess."

The jewelry was pretty but I have the same stuff from the forties. it is copies of the forties. And Paloma did her little heart-shaped Elsa thing. It was expensive stuff-$27000 for a bracelet. After work I glued myself and went to Mr. Chow's for dinner for Paloma (cab $4). Saw Fran Lebowitz and told her she should go find a guy to have a hot love affair with because then if she ever has to write about one she will not be blank-a-roo. Perry Ellis looked really sexy with long hair. Everybody was somebody. Thomas Ammann was in town from Argentina he said it is so expensive there he does not know how anyone lives. He had a limo and I got home at 1:00.

I say that Interview is a small magazine and he says no no it is not it is not. And he will not let me put my two cents in about it. I tell him ""Fred Time is a 'large magazine.' They get $75000 a page. We get $3000."" And he said ""No no we get $3 100."" I mean what is the difference? Paige said there was the opening of Nell's and that Steven Greenberg had a date with somebody she introduced him to and that he would take us all to Le Bernardin the expensive fish restaurant in the Equitable building. We went and it is so elegant so grand and the food is sort of ordinary but very expensive. My fish was cooked in sauerkraut so it was good just like eating a hot dog on the corner. Then we went with Steven to pick up Donna McKechnie who is back starring in Chorus Line. Steven knows all these same types of girls in their late thirties or forties who're on the prowl. Like Elizabeth Ray and Margaux Hemingway. Donna McKechnie was giving an interview to Frank Rich and she is actually beautiful but she is in a category that you can not do much with-forty-four and with a beautiful body but it is hard to find another show to dance in. She was kind of classy in a whorey way and she had a dress that was showing her nakedness. She was too grand for me but she was sweet. Then we went down to 14th Street to the opening of Nell's and that was really exciting. Rupert Everett came in with a costar of his. And Nell was sweet she said I would be the only one allowed to take pictures. But I did not want to move around really. Bianca was there and Lauren Hutton and Schnabel and everybody who'd ordinarily be at the Odeon. Paige went downstairs dancing with Benjamin and Schnabel and Alba Clemente and all those people. Peter Beard was there with his entourage. they will charge $5 admission. I do not know if those downtown kids will put it down because they are so used to freebies. Then we left and I feel funny when Steven takes us out because although he spends so much money on us I have the feeling in the back of my mind that he may be (laughs) a secret cheap person. You know? I have not figured out yet how he thinks. But he is always so generous to us. He dropped me off. And Steven and Nell both do the same thing-they carry a hairbrush and pull it out and brush their hair all the time. I guess Steven Greenberg's George Washington hair is his fortune his trademark."

Then cabbed to meet Paige at the office ($5 newspapers $2 phone $1.50). And Paige and I had a big scene about these chocolates that this Neuchatel chocolate woman brought down. I mean Paige is just absolutely a weirdo. I had a talk with Fred and he says it is not good to be so involved with people from the office and maybe he is right because I see one side but then there is other sides. So this woman brings down all this chocolate and Paige has been telling her how much everyone there loves chocolate and Paige will not even have one piece! And I am saying ""Paige have a piece"" and she is shrieking and laughing hysterically and absolutely refusing and finally I ate lots of pieces but nobody else would. Here this woman's an advertiser and it is all these secret chocolate-eaters and they will not touch one piece! So finally I took all the chocolate upstairs and then Paige came and wanted some and I refused to give it to her. And I finally read a Xerox of Tama's story from The New Yorker and it was fun reading all about what life was like living with Ronnie-she calls him ""Stash"" in the story-and she made herself ""Eleanor"" and not a writer but a jewelry designer. And none of the people that I am with a lot now drink or anything. Wilfredo does not drink and Paige does not. And last night PH reminded me about how I used to put people down for not drinking that I would say ""They think they are too good to drink"" and it is true I did used to feel that way but when you do not drink yourself you sure see things differently."

I would been meaning to call her for a while. She was a sweet old lady. I guess she was old enough though in her eighties I think. It seems like I just saw her on the Johnny Carson show. Jackie wants to take an ad in Interview for a play he is opening but how can we trust him to pay? Jean Michel Basquiat me John Sex and Fab Five Freddy cabbed uptown to the Lyceum and the Whoopi Goldberg show ($8). We were late and in the second row. Whoopi was great for one and a half hours just a blank stage but she held your interest. she is really intelligent and everything. She does a thing where she asks for quarters from the audience but then she did not give them back. So when it was over and we went back to see her she said that she usually gives them back-I asked her-but that a guy had given her a dollar bill and that threw her off and now she had about $4 and so she might just now give the money to a Catholic charity. She really liked Jean Michel Basquiat and I invited her to dinner but she said she had cramps or something.

The Thurn und Taxis guy and Pierre de Malleray picked us up to go downtown to dinner at Ballato's. The Taxis guy got drunk and he told a lot of stories. he is the richest guy in Germany he is got a great body but his face is a little puffy he is old. He said some Negroes came up to him by his hotel and started to follow him with a baseball bat they were calling him a faggot and he turned around and said ""Listen here you black niggers"" something like that he told them off and they were so stunned that they went away. He said you have to fight back or you do not survive. We went to Halston's and Dolly was there wearing the most horrible dress a Halston that just looked awful. she is fat she likes to eat."
"Tuesday, October 18, 1977",[],0.15625,Woke up after a good long night's sleep. I needed it to clear up some pimples. When you do not sleep you really have them. Doug Christmas did not send a check yet and I told Fred to tell him I was not going to Paris unless we got it.

Half of my face is perfect and the other half is broken out all eruptions. It peels away your face. I went to a new beauty doctor and he gave me licorice root to take. I think maybe he just gives out things he wants to get rid of. And he is such a camp too. These quacks. The first time he took his fingers and touched my face he said ""does not this feel tense?"" and the second time he took his fingers and touched my face the same way and in the same place and he said ""does not this feel relaxed?"" Cab ($6) to B. Altman's dinner for the highfalutins. Ran into Sid and Anne Bass and into Ashton Hawkins. Got drunk and said terr-said funny-I was outrageous I guess.

So I decided to call and get tickets to go see him in Brigadoon. Oh I ran into a boy whose job is to go shopping for John and Yoko to buy them clothes and things. I asked him if they would ever made him bring anything back and he said just once. I asked him if they ever wore any of the clothes they bought since they do not go out and he said ""they are going to make a comeback. they have been wearing them to the studio."" Oh and the best thing he said was that when he started to work for them he had to sign a paper that said ""I will not write a book about John Lennon and/or Yoko Ono."" is not that great? He said he loves his job. I should find somebody to help me shop-show me where all the good new things are. Oh and I had a fight with the real estate guy. The building I wanted so badly on 22nd Street that I told him to keep me informed on he said went into contract on Friday. I was so mad. And then he told me that we had an appointment to look at the Con Ed building on 12th Street. And that is a great building but it is just too far downtown I can not face it. it is $1.5 plus it would be another million to fix up. We missed the opening of Brigadoon. John Curry was not great he was just adequate but he is a good actor. I just loved the show. The guy in front of us was from George Lois with a good Irish name maybe Callaghan he is the one I worked with when I did that Braniff commercial with Sonny Liston. And he told me the best sick joke. What are Bing Crosby and John Wayne getting for Christmas? Steve McQueen. Backstage I told John the show was so exciting and he said how I did not recognize him on the street and I explained that it was the hairdo that I recognized him three blocks later. I asked him to dinner but he said he was having dinner with friends."

Like Loulou de la Falaise's husband who is supposed to be a novelist but I do not think he is ever finished anything. So Diane's going the Marilyn Monroe route of marrying one person for the name and now she is going with this guy who will write books about her. Worked. Fred decided to come along. Closed up fast. Went to the Carlyle ran into Sue Mengers in the elevator who'd been at the party she was with her same husband and she is thin and I do not know what she is doing. She lives here now. The cake was in the shape of a book. Bob Colacello was there. I read his article on Bianca in the new Vanity Fair. she is back big again the pictures of her walking with the Salvadorean children in the fields. Jean Michel Basquiat called back from the Ivory Coast. He said they sell meat with four million flies on it-they cut off a piece and just sell it with the flies. He sounded normal like he was off drugs and missing old times he wants to do prints together."

Then Calvin arrived with the interviewer from Playboy. Jean Michel Basquiat had his hand on Bianca's knee-she giggled. Then the greatest moment came when I went to pay the bill and Bianca said Calvin had paid. Bianca said she wanted to go to where they were shooting Rhinestone on West Broadway at one of the galleries. So we went down there and found Steve Rubell. Then Stallone came over. he is hot for Bianca I think he saw her and came right over. And I yapped about where was my role in Rhinestone that I would paid $5000 to get at some Marvin Davis charity auction out in Colorado. And they would turned this art gallery into a bar for the movie. You could see how much money they are spending. It was the first time I would been to a movie set where they would really turned something into something else completely. Zooms and booms all over the street. I thought the cab that was sitting behind me was part of the movie but then it turned out it was not so I got in and took it home ($6).

It was a good plastic ring from the twenties. I walked on Madison and it was cold in the shade and warm in the sun. I had on the coat that Marina gave me which I love the Calvin Klein one with the hood but the pockets are not useful. they are so big but the way they are made everything slips out. Walked all the way down to the office and the sun was so bright in people's eyes that I did not get recognized a lot. Fred is coming back from L.A. And Craig Nelson called a few times I am hating him so much that I think I will take Christopher with me to some of the cities I have to do the book tour in just to drive Craig crazy. I read in ""Suzy"" about the Kluge party that I missed in Virginia everyone went to it. I just did not want to break my rut but boy I should have-it was every portrait I should ever be doing. And Paul Morrissey's movie Mixed Blood is still packing them in they say. We got the rights to Trash back from Cinema 5 and it is funny we have to go someplace and physically pick them up. And my big Mao painting is still lost somewhere in Europe they think Nice. it is Leo's fault.

He and Georgia O'Keeffe are at the Mayfair (cab $3.50). As I got to the office Joseph Beuys the German artist was getting out of a car with his children and Heiner Bastion-about eight people. He kissed me on the mouth and I got nervous. I did not know what to talk to him about. Heiner Friedrich and Philippa de Menil came by. And Robert Hayes had Sally Kellerman and Barry Diller and Barry McKinley there and there was no room to sit down. And Heiner Bastion said I should photograph Beuys for a portrait. Then I was photographing Georgia and Juan in the back. it is too hard with famous people at the office all at the same time because nobody can understand why anybody else is there. I worked until 4:00 with Georgia. Finally they all left. Later I went to the horse show at Madison Square Garden. I went over with a bunch of horse people to the Statler Hilton for scrambled eggs and bacon I guess that is what horse people like to eat. It was good. I stole some silverware and then it was embarrassing because it fell out and everybody saw it. It was Statler Hilton silverware from the forties. At Studio 54 after that I ran into Steve Rubell who said that on Friday he was going to be sentenced to two months in jail that he would made a deal with the government-they would dropped the drug charges and he would pleaded guilty to income tax evasion. He asked if we would come and visit him.

Bruno arrived and surprised us. And his wife-Yoyo. And they looked at the big paintings that Jean Michel Basquiat has been doing silkscreens on and they had a sour look they said it ruined his ""intuitive primitivism."" But he would always Xeroxed before and nobody knew it just looked like new drawings and put on with that stuff. Worked till 7:30. Then there was a party for Van Johnson at Limelight. When we got there he was leaving already. It was a party he was giving for Janet Leigh. And he was such a camp. He said ""Oh I have been dying to meet you forever!"" He seems like a big boozer. I guess there were not enough cute boys in there. Then in the middle of the room was a shower and a girl in it and blood all over and a guy like Tony Perkins in a grandmother's outfit. And in the middle of all this was the real Janet Leigh in a blue sequined dress."

After a benefit fashion show of Madame Gres went up to Diane de Beauvau's new showroom to see her first collection. I had to start lying immediately and tell her it was all great but especially after seeing all those beautiful Madame Gres and all the Halstons her stuff just looked so bad. She acts like a businesswoman-she does not take much coke in the day-but I do not know I think it is going to be a disaster. At dinner later at Quo Vadis Tim Leary was really sweet he talked some more for the tape about how Diane writing him those love letters and taking acid when she was fourteen got him in jail in Switzerland. He said the jails in Geneva can be like a good hotel-if you pay them they bring you pastries on a tray. And I can not believe it he remembers each time he ever saw me in the sixties and then in St. Moritz-what I was wearing everything-and I did not even know at the time that he would be noticing. Like when we went to his lecture and light-show things in the East Village. He said that if he had it to do all over again he wished he were with the Velvet Underground because they did so much and were really creative. I just think he is so intelligent. He probably really was with the CIA because he was the one at Harvard and now they are showing that the government was using LSD so far back and Tim was the master and when you are a master they do approach you. Diane de Beauvau and Pierre were on a couch arguing. She wanted him to think she was in love with Tim Leary and that they would had a romance so to do that she made a point of telling Pierre that there was absolutely nothing going on that she was not in love with Tim. So then he had to do the thing of caring because that was how she would be happy.

And then Governor Carey's wife-the Greek lady Evangeline-came and she came prepared for a free portrait. She was not wearing a hat like she always does and so I said ""where is your hat?"" and she said ""None of your girls wear hats in their portraits."" So I took pictures of her and then I did not know what to do so I called Bob in and he talked to her and then he told her how much the portraits cost and I think she must have fainted because after she left she had her guy call and say that a governor's wife could not spend that much on a portrait while he was in office. But before she would been saying that she wanted to have it done while he was in office because then it would have ""more prestige."" So she was trying to do all these maneuvers. And I forgot to add that with Jean Michel Basquiat the day before he reached into his pocket and said he would pay back the $40 he owed me from the days when he painted T-shirts and used to borrow money from me and I said oh no that is okay and I was embarrassed-I was surprised that is all I would given him I thought it was more. So we were busy all afternoon. And miniskirts are really back Cornelia was wearing one at Xenon later."

And the other night at a party Mario D'Urso said ""I have been working on getting the pope for you."" Everybody thinks I want to do the pope so badly. Well I do but I am not desperate. I turned down doing the Ronald Reagan cover for New York. The papers have me down as a One-Night Republican. Worked on backgrounds. Rupert was back from being out looking for Mickey Mouse pictures for the New Myths series for Ron Feldman-Mickey Mouse Donald Duck the Shadow. we will have to do something different like throw diamond dust on them. Glued myself together then picked up Carolina Herrera and we decided to walk to Halston's. She took her earrings off and gave them to me. We had drinks. Victor was in his samurai pants really big. Then we got in two limos and went to the B. Altman dinner honoring American designers it was a New York Public Library benefit. Mary Lasker was there and Estee Lauder and Mary McFadden. I talked to ""Suzy""-Aileen Mehle. She looked beautiful she had her two tits pushed up so you could look down. I was sitting with Halston. We decided I should only take pictures of the twenty waiters. Victor and I went to the bathroom and he took off his samurai pants and I wore them as a cape. We thought the bathroom was empty but as we were leaving everybody came out of the stalls. April Axton was there with Sam Wagstaff who looked older. I accused April of being Jewish and she said how could she be since I have seen her at my church St. Vincent Ferrer. I brought up about how April once accused me of raping her dog in a bathroom. The dog had followed me in and then when I came out he came out with me. she is awful but she is funny. I told her again that those photographs she gave Sam that I took of her in the sixties were now worth $1000 1 rubbed it in. Then Carolina and I went to Carmen D'Alessio's dinner for her forty friends at Mr. Chow's. Lester Persky was giving millions of toasts he was drunk. He toasted Henry Geldzahler who was not even there. Then he forced me to give a toast so my toast was ""Free drinks from Lester for everybody."""

Every person in the world was there. Beverly Johnson asked me to go sit at Eddie Murphy's table but I just could not. There was just one chair and I would not have known what to talk about. I would have to be macho. it is funny how you have not heard his name in a year is not it? I think people want to see lots of cheap quickie B movies. The big stars do these few big expensive movies and they are away for a whole year. he is got the new movie coming out Golden Child. Grace Jones arrived late and made an entrance. Peter Beard was there and looks really good. And his new girlfriend is nothing like all his other girlfriends she is from Afghanistan. And I heard that Robert Mapplethorpe and Sam Wagstaff are both in the hospital. Paige dropped me (newspapers $6).

Tama Janowitz's date will be Dr. Bernsohn I think she could get material from him and I am lining up a Ford model for Paige. Steve Rubell called about the Dolly Parton/Sandy Gallin thing. He said that it was really Geffen who was getting the painting. He said that Dolly never saw the painting and that she did not understand that it was going to be over the fireplace but I said no that she knew exactly where it was for because she was standing right there when Sandy showed me. I got a cab at 8:00 to pick Cornelia up. Went to Regine's ($4) and I just had a light jacket and all these places have such strong air conditioning it really is frightening (doorman $5 limo $25). It was a costume party and Anthony Quinn was there and Pele and Lee Radziwill and it was an old crowd. And Mariel Hemingway's husband Steve Crisman was very friendly so nice and then he started being hip with me like saying ""Give me two"" and doing the two fingers and I said I did not know all that hip talk and he said oh that he did not really either. He talked about the Mandrexes and going to India and that type of thing. Cornelia wanted to go to the Zulu Lounge so we left and went up there. Gael Love was sort of embarrassed because I saw her there dancing with that guy who is big and acts butch who writes for the magazine. Somebody Bob discovered about five years ago-Chuck Pfeiffer. Someone said he is married but he is never with a wife and he is too-much you know? Tama was with Gael and she said that her romance with Bob Guccione Jr. had not worked out that he was supposed to take her to L.A. and did not."

They brought pictures of the husband who just died but they were not right so they are going to send down some more for a portrait. She might want her portrait done too. Nobody was around so Victor served. she is a short little woman she is eighty-two years old. I asked the son about Self magazine-he said they survey everything by computer every month that is how they know what is happening. Had to go to Richard Weisman's party for Governor Brown that Catherine had arranged. Curley was with me Fred had invited him. Bad traffic Castro's in town (cab $3.50). Bo Polk was there and he invited me to a George Bush party. Then Pat Hickey the hockey player arrived with his girlfriend and he looked like the Tareyton ad his eye was all black. Governor Brown came and he gave a speech and I taped it and afterwards he asked what I taped it for and all the kids told him ""For nothing-he just throws the tapes in a box."" He did not say much but when you give speeches all the time what is left to talk about? Stephanie was back with Bo Polk Stephanie McLuhan but I noticed she made a beeline for the governor when he arrived and kissed him although she did not know him. And then after the speech she got up and asked an involved question I guess to show she was intelligent but she was stupid and he was stupid. He came around afterwards to shake my hand and get my vote he said something referring to the art thing I guess-the legislation that would make artists get royalties or something when their paintings are resold-but it did not make sense to me. Diane Von Furstenberg told him he would gotten too skinny that he would lost his ""love handles"" and that she would liked them. I wanted somebody to ask ""Is Jerry a fairy?"" and Diane said no that he was not that Jerry's no fairy. Judith Hollander and Jed were there they came by on their way to Tom Cashin's birthday party at ""21."" I just wanted to go home but Catherine wanted me to go to Elaine's with Rod and Judy Gilbert and Pat Hickey and his girlfriend. Elaine was sitting at a table with five girls and one I think was Candy Bergen because later people said that it was but it did not look like her and I looked at her and she looked at me and we did not say anything. If it was her she looks older. Pat Hickey took his girlfriend home and then came back because Catherine had been flirting with him all evening. Richard was trying to get me to drink tequila and about 2:00 I left (cab $3)."

And a bracelet I would made out of pennies. PH picked me up and we went to the Dakota (cab $6.50). There were fans outside in honor of the day still on the ""vigil."" Because the ninth is Sean and John's birthday. Inside Yoko's door everybody had taken their shoes off so there was a line of shoes. I would not take mine off though and I did not want PH to either so that I would not be alone. PH said that when she went to the Royal Palace once in Hawaii that the tour guides gave you booties to put over your shoes and that would be a better way to keep the house clean I think. So then when we heard a glass drop and break that was our excuse-that we did not want to be in our socks when there might be glass. Yoko ran to call Sean and he came in and said ""Did you bring my dollar?"" Yoko said that he would been remembering and wanting the other half of the dollar I tore in half the last time. So I gave him a whole bunch of torn bills that I would brought for him and he went off to try to find the match to the half he had. Keith was there and he brought Kenny Scharf as his date. Walter Cronkite was there and John Cage and Louise Nevelson and Lisa Robinson. On purpose for fun I had spelled Sean's name ""Shawn"" on a couple of his gifts and so when Sean autographed napkins for me he signed it that way too. He was wearing Michael Jackson-type gloves but on both hands that his friend little Max Leroy Warner Leroy's son had given him. Michael Jackson is his favorite singer. He said he likes Prince too and he must like Boy George too because later on his computer he did a drawing of Boy George. Sean and Keith hit it off. Keith is very good playing with kids-he was playing really well with another baby that was there too coming after her with a stuffed animal. Sean sat between me and Roberta Flack. The cake was a big blond grand piano. Sean was the one who had the idea that it should be a piano. He has a piano in his bedroom. And he cut the cake. Harry Nilsson led everyone singing ""For he is a Jolly Good Fellow"" and later Sean made a really nice speech and said that if his father were there we would be singing 'Tor they are Jolly Good Fellows"" After dinner Yoko and Sean and some of the people went over to the WNEW broadcast that they were originally going to do inside the building but at the last minute the Dakota would not let them. But most of the people stayed behind. We went into Sean's bedroom-and there was a kid there setting up the Apple computer that Sean had gotten as a present the Macintosh model. I said that once some man had been calling me a lot wanting to give me one but that I would never called him back or something and then the kid looked up and said ""Yeah that was me. I am Steve Jobs."" And he looked so young like a college guy. And he told me that he would still send me one now. And then he gave me a lesson on drawing with it. It only comes in black and white now but they will make it soon in color. And then Keith and Kenny used it. Keith had already used it once to make a T-shirt but Kenny was using it for the first time and I felt so old and out of it with this young whiz guy right there who'd helped invent it. Sean's bedroom had two mattresses on the floor and lots of Beatles pictures and the big Rupert Smith picture of Yoko on the wall. There was wrapping paper and presents all over the floor and lots of robot toys on the shelves. After we left I was so blue because before I was Sean's best grownup friend and now I think Keith is. They really hit it off. He invited Keith to his party for kids the next day and I do not think I was invited and I am hurt."
"Tuesday, September 1, 1981",[],-0.0035493827160493845,"- Colorado We had to get out at 10:30 I had to do four TV shows. Went to the campus and I had to pose with a cow-they brought a cow from one of their agriculture things. So I had to hug a cow standing in front of the Soup Cans. It was fun. And then I did all this TV. I was good I could answer all these dumb questions. They said that when Rauschenberg was there nobody would come and that I am the most famous artist in the world. At the opening we had to go into the show the back way. All these kids pushing and shoving and I had to sit there. All I do is sign sign sign. And the biggest shock was two hours later this girl comes up and says ""Hi it is Eva your niece."" And I did not know what to do with her. This is Eva who lived in my house on 89th and Lex for a few months in '69 or '70 taking care of my mother. She said ""I have been waiting two and a half hours in line."" And I knew I was in Denver where my nephew ex-Father Paul is and I did not call him either. Eva just read it in the paper. I can not face a family I guess. I was signing signing signing and then a guy came with a big fat yellow snake around his neck. He was so creepy and he said ""Sign my snake"" and Christopher freaked out and said ""No snakes! No snakes to be signed!"" So he said ""Sign my forehead."" So here's this snake coming at me. So I put an ""X"" on his forehead. Because I could not write I was just too nervous with the snake. We had to go through another whole hour ordeal. It looked like it would never be the end but finally it was the end. So I guess there is always an end."

And the news was that Carl Andre the artist may have pushed his wife out the window in the apartment in the high rise in the Village where they lived. The big headline said that he was suspected but then the article was all about how she would probably fallen. And Sandro said ""Good good they should kill all women."" he is getting divorced from his wife."

She was at the antiques fair there with Jed. Admission was $3 5 which I stupidly paid because nobody told me that it was put on by the Folk Art Museum that I am a trustee of. I met up with the guy who runs the museum Bishop who thinks my collection's no good. he is stupid. I hate all that American Primitive stuff now anyway the jazzy painted stuff-it looks like junk -the toys and dolls and merry-go-rounds and Indian baskets. At Charles Evans's dinner Bo Polk was there and he knew every single girl in the room. He and Stephanie McLuhan are broken up but she was there too. Bo accused me of being the one who introduced him to Barry Landau but really he knows I really warned him.

The Richard Pryor people told her Richard was ""in seclusion"" in Hawaii and that they were going to ""wait to give him his mail when he gets back in October."" She was out there trying to get a screenplay she wrote sold-Coppola's Zoetrope studio had it for two years and did not get it financed and then they went bankrupt. While she was out there she wrote up the treatment I asked her to about a sixties ""Girl of the Year"" because I want to show it to Jon and maybe he can get Paramount interested. And it is a good thing she is back because she was about to get fired from her one-minute-a-day job. While she was gone Truman died. His old boyfriend Jack Dunphy got $600000 and was carrying the ashes in a golden book with ""TC"" engraved on the side. And Brigid figured out that Kate ""Harrington"" is not Truman's niece-she is actually Kate O'Shea! The daughter of Truman's old boyfriend Jack O'Shea. The one who lived on Long Island and had a wife and lots of kids. And I am doing paintings now of Truman for the cover of New York magazine. So Jean Michel Basquiat just called me and I have not heard from him in two days. Now he is staying all the time at the Ritz Carlton instead of down on Great Jones and his room is like $250 a night. Fred went off to Lord Jermyn's wedding. Jay's on jury duty and Kate broke up with him and I do not know he seems sort of relieved. I read the article in the Times very low-key that said that Barry Diller was leaving Paramount to go to Fox! And that he was getting $30 million. So Jon will probably now work for Frank Mancuso there at Paramount or something. it will actually be better for him. Barry did make the place great though. I worked on Judy Garland for Ron Feldman. The ""What Becomes a Legend Most"" advertisement."

He told me a story about how he would wanted to buy a pack of cigarettes so he did a drawing and sold it for $.75 and then a week later his gallery called up and said they had this drawing of his there and should they buy it for $1000. Jean Michel Basquiat thought it was funny. It is. And he was on his way upstairs to see if anybody would buy a painting of his for $2. I mean because now his paintings go for $15000 and so he wanted to see if anybody would give him $2 for one. Lidija was there did a workout. Oh and the girl Jean Michel Basquiat took around the world and left in London arrived in New York and wanted a ticket back to California.

Jon said he had to go to a video convention but that he would try to come. John Reinhold was coming and Wilson Kidde. And Rupert had arrived at the office looking like he was my son or something. Or like he was the artist. (laughs) A bow tie. White shirt. Blue blazer. Bluejeans. And cowboy boots. And then when I stared at him because he was dressed exactly like me he got too embarrassed so he changed his bow tie into a long one. Got there and there were so many people all young. Nobody over twenty-one. Chris got mad at me because he said he was really lonely and that I was not taking care of him that I was not taking him off to any parties and I told him I could not that night because Halston had invited me to dinner and I could not bring anybody and that was that. Chris was with the Loud girl and he just got mad and rode off in his car. Went to Halston's for dinner before the reopening of Studio 54. Halston had wanted to give a party for Steve before the reopening but Steve told him Calvin was already giving him one. So then Halston asked Steve to choose between him and Calvin-Steve chose Calvin. But then Calvin smoothed things over by calling Halston to invite him. Went in Halston's car and arrived to the Sovereign and went up to Calvin's penthouse and everybody was either famous or beautiful-Brooke Shields and seventy-five other models and Jack Nicholson was there. And Godunov was there he came over and he looked so beautiful and sexy and he is just changed his whole personality he is so free and talkative now. Then we went to Studio 54 and the street was just mobbed like I have never seen it and it made my art opening look like it would been deserted. And Calvin took Brooke. It was so jammed they must have made a fortune at $25 a head. Went to leave at quarter to 3:00. It took us fifteen minutes to get out of the place. Oh and I forgot to say that Truman called on Monday and his voice-I did not even know it was him on the phone. He was saying cuckoo things like that he would died twice and that his brain had stopped for thirty-two seconds so that is what he was going to call his next book-Thirty-two Seconds. Then the next day Tuesday at about 6:30 he collapsed in his lobby and all the newspapers and TV reporters rushed over to you.N. Plaza. He was taken to the hospital and it was front-page news it got the cover of the Post and everything and so I think he must have gotten the press that we were supposed to get at the Feldman Gallery. Because the TV people never came.

Had Fred get a car. Bob and I cabbed to Doubles ($5). We were having lunch with Jean Tailer and Pat Buckley. I checked my bag had drinks and then lunch. It was a ladies' lunch all the ladies like to go to Doubles for lunch because it is cheap and you can eat all you want and go back all the time and it is horrible food like smoked turkey and smoked ham and it gave me a sore throat. All these rich ladies who spend money on clothes but they will not buy good food. Bob was the best gossiper. Pat Buckley said she was so thrilled that Shogun was on TV. She said the night before she just went to bed with a tray and watched all three hours of it and had her girlfriends call her between segments-she did not even go downstairs to see George Bush who was having dinner with her husband. And she was so disappointed that it was only going to be on for two hours that night. Arrived in Philadelphia and could not find Delancey Street the driver was too old and cranky. Saw the cracked bell. Found Walter Stait. We told him that we would not be staying over after all that we had to do a portrait early in the morning in New York. Had tea changed. Emlen Etting was there in a black cape and black hat so old looking like one of those funny fairies. We gave him a lift to the museum. All the old bags were there. Met Jamie did some TV. His father and mother were no-shows. His brother Nicky and his brother's wife Jane who works for Sotheby's were there. Arnold Schwarzenegger was not and Nureyev was not. I saw Bettie Barnes who let my cat die. it is a man. B-E-T-T-I-E. I once gave him a kitten and the kitten was crying and I thought it wanted its mother so I gave him the mother. We had two cats left my mother and I had given away twenty-five already. This was the early sixties. And after I gave him the mother he took her to be spayed and she died under the knife. My darling Hester. She went to pussy heaven. And I have felt guilty ever since. that is how we should have started Popism. that is when I gave up caring. I do not want to think about it. If I had had her spayed myself I just know she would have lived but he let her die. So it was Jamie's big show. I had to stand in front of my portrait. Jamie is painting bigger-more Pop-pictures now. I told him he should go even bigger and he said he did not think you could get stretchers that big and I said you could get them as big as the sky. Phyllis Wyeth was my dinner partner and my other dinner partner was Bonny Wintersteen she is filthy rich. Warren Adelson and his wife were there and she was wearing the same dress she wore in Monte Carlo and I said ""that is the same dress you were wearing in Monte Carlo"" and she said that when she was getting dressed to come she said ""Nobody will remember this dress except Andy Warhol. he will say 'that is the same dress you wore in Monte Carlo.' "" It was funny we had fun. Walter Stait was funny. I was having a good time until Fred told me that this place the Fairmont Hotel where we went after the museum was where they had Legionnaire's Disease and then my throat started hurting more. But they said it had been completely renovated. Then we slipped out and went back to Walter's to get Fred's bag. A two-hour ride back. I wanted to give the driver a really big tip but Fred said you can not spoil them ($20)."

They had covered the whole fountain in Grand Army Plaza with a tent and then there was another tent too and it was a fashion show for Calvin's first one-of-a-kind clothes. It was really rich.

David Brinkley was filming Halston's rehearsals of his people to take them to the Far East and then the crew is going to follow Halston to China. It looked so rich at Halston's so many orchids so cool the girls running around with their brand-new luggage. Halston made 500 new pieces of clothes for the trip and some of the girls are taking the clothes for pay and some are (laughs) just taking money. The clothes were beautiful. Afterwards I decided to walk to 42nd Street and ohhh it was like a crazy play. Black guys mingling around waiting to tear the next gold chain off. The jewelry shop guys with guns strapped to their ankles. And the black guys hanging around the stores with all the diamonds in them as if it is the neighborhood corner-grocery store. It was like a make-believe movie. Had an appointment at the office at 3:00. Brigid lost three pounds. she is eating three meals but all dietetic. She calls her O.A. friends-Overeaters Anonymous-the night before and they plan out exactly what they will eat the next day and then once you plan it you can not change it you have to have a hamburger patty if you have said so you can not change it to fish. They watch each other. she is down to 166.

Brooke Shields did not show up so he did a live telephone interview with Sophia Loren who is in town at the Pierre. Her English is good now. But you know seeing her on TV this morning she is just ... trashy. She said she would not let her daughter be in a movie like Brooke Shields's Pretty Baby and I mean did not she just fuck her way to the top? who is she kidding? she is so pretentious. I am supposed to see her on Thursday. Oh and Monday afternoon at the office I stood there and listened to an unbelievable conversation-Vincent on the phone with our lawyer discussing if I should serve a summons on Sophia Loren when I went to have dinner with her! This is for the lawsuit we are bringing against her husband Carlo Ponti who produced Frankenstein and Dracula [see Introduction]. They were completely serious. Now see it would not be direct-there would be this little man with me and when Sophia opened the door the little man would slap her with the summons. Then she and I would have dinner as if nothing happened. This is what they were working out for me! I just watched Vincent's end of the discussion on the phone and my mouth was open. Catherine said we had to go to the screening of the Sophia Loren movie since it was especially for us because were going to interview her. Cabbed to 1600 Broadway ($2.60). It looked like a 1950s Italian movie. Beautiful settings. Sophia is a housewife with cute fat Italian kids and on a day when Hitler's in Italy the whole building goes to his parade. Her bird that talks gets away and she is intrigued by Marcello Mastroianni the man across the way. Then I fell asleep. When I woke up he was telling her that he was a fairy and he could not get it up for women. Then I fell asleep again. When I woke up she was on top of him and they were making it but they had their clothes on. It was all mostly in one room. Then she is home and everybody comes back from the parade and she sees the light go out across the way and two guys have come to take him away and send him to you know Fire Island or someplace because that is where they sent his boyfriend.

She said Prince Rainier was crying and Prince Albert could not talk. Went to Diane Von Furstenberg's (cab $4). Barry Diller was there and Valentino. But out of the corner of my eye I saw George Plimpton and his wife Freddy and when she saw me she began running around me and acting just nuts. She felt guilty because George helped Jean Stein with the Edie book. She was like a headless chicken running around just making all these noises. And I told her ""Look I do not know what you are carrying on about. I do not care about the stupid book."" I should have said that if she wanted to make it up to me just send a check. And I could see Jon talking to George and later he told me he told George how could he put those things in the book about me when he knew me personally and he knew they were not true and that Edie was away from the Factory for years before she died."

Cabbed to 30 Rockefeller Center ($4.50). Had trouble because the 6' blonde girl downstairs did not know who Nelson was did not know who I was and did not know what Saturday Night Live was. She was very beautiful but really dumb. So finally I got there. We met in this big office with the producer and the director Jean Doumanian. They wanted me to do something one week but I told them that if I could not be a regular I would not do it. Nelson thinks I should do something political. And then the meeting ended Hollywood-style-that is where the meeting's suddenly over and they ignore you and talk about other things. They do not say ""Thank you it was nice of you to come."" Suddenly they just drop you only you are still sitting there so it is like you are invisible. it is kind of great. Then afterwards Nelson and I went downstairs in the elevator and I was telling him about the beautiful 6' blonde girl who did not know who he was or me either and he made fun of how I always get things wrong-he said it was probably a 2' black girl down there and then we got downstairs and by then it (laughs) was a black girl. So we were really laughing and I said no no no that it really had been a big blonde before."

Jean Tailer was there and Christina Carimati and Marion Javits and Joe Eula who I have not seen in months. Twenty-seven people. And Victor called from Paris.

And they have to go back next week for a blood test. Went back downtown. Bought extra Time magazines ($6). With my Gotti cover they picked a nice one for the cover and it is one of those weeks where Time and Newsweek actually have different covers. Cabbed downtown ($6) and Sam had read my appointment book so he saw that I was having ""dinner with Cher"" and he immediately started talking to me again. I guess he actually does believe I am seeing John Travolta and Diana Ross this week too."

But I know she was just doing her job and did not really want to do it and she kept bubbling and gave her fake speech and asked for his money back. I said well sure I would send it to him. Fred enjoys confronting people sometimes so maybe he should do this and then I can still stay a nice guy. I mean what was all that about having me rush rush rush the job and everything? And so after that I had some chocolate and watched TV and fell asleep."

She said she was going to a Baptist church and just wandered into mine. Wandered down Fifth Avenue. Crazy Matty came by the office and Brigid got him to leave. he is thin again but he is okay not more crazy than usual-just normally crazy. I do not think he still has that girl living with him in his hotel room. Oh but why is it that crazy people can get boyfriends and girlfriends and normal people can not? Can you tell me? I got invited to the Malcolm Forbes boat with Mrs. Marcos. I really want to get her portrai before you know something happens over there. Fred Leighton must be so glad when he hears she is in town.

Bob MacBride peed on one of the Piss paintings in the back for me and he kept going back to see if the colors had changed. Truman told Brigid about the drying-out place and she interviewed him and that is where her sister Richie is too. Paul Morrissey was down and he and Truman talked all afternoon about scripts and things. Then Toni arrived four hours late she had a Santa costume for me and a little girl outfit for Truman. But Truman was not in the mood to go into drag he said that he was already dressed like a little boy. Truman was really drunk hugging around. Truman was pleading with Brigid to get him a drink and not tell Bob-this is after she caught him drinking in the kitchen. Ronnie was trying to make the makeup girl. My makeup was not working it was no use I had too many pimples.

Met Howard Cosell and his wife and was surprised he was so tall. I liked him he was fun. My portrait of Pele was going to be presented. Pele's mother and father were there and they were cute and his wife who was white but everybody in South America is all different colors- his parents were different colors too. After the dinner we went over to P.J. Clarke's ($2.50). Tucker Frederickson the football player that I like so much was there. he is so adorable I kept telling him he should do more TV but he said he did not want to. Had a bowl of chili.

You never hear about her since she got sick. it is so quick what happens in New York. You can just get forgotten in five minutes. Less. You can see millions of people all the time every night for years and then they can forget you in a minute. Benjamin arrived early to pick me up. He was not in drag. I wish he would be. He looks so much more masculine when he goes into drag. it is strange because he looks so slight and girlish as a boy and then he goes into drag and you notice his hands are so veiny and he has big shoulders and tough hands. I would like to start wearing lipstick at night so my lips look fuller but I am afraid I would get stuck under a bright light someplace.
"Tuesday, September 29, 1981",[Martha Graham],0.04126262626262626,I got up early because I had a yoga class at 9:30. And I am so surprised I never took yoga years ago. it is just so nothing just sitting and stretching. And that is why I gave up Martha Graham years ago-in Pittsburgh I took a class from one of her teachers who was married to an Indian. And Nelson came down he said he would been up for forty-five hours and he was trying to do dialogue for my spot which we have to film on Friday morning. He wanted me to talk about the old Saturday Night Live show. I said I never watched it. Belushi's staying at his apartment in Los Angeles. Took my vitamins. Felt like I was flying all night.

And I can just see it in the papers now after he kills Greta Garbo: ""Andy Warhol gave me the address."" Oh you know I was talking to somebody yesterday and I found out that Bruce Springsteen really does give a lot of his money away so I do like him now. Maybe we can get him for a cover when he is wanting to publicize Farm Aid. Saw American Flyer. I was looking at this girl in the movie with this hooked nose and I realized it was Jennifer Grey. I mean it is really sad her father got himself a new nose and did not send her for one. is not that mean? Oh but go to the movie for the nose-you have to see it. And for Kevin Costner he will have a big career. The movie's really good."

They are fun-when you go through them there is things you really do not want to give up. Some day I will sell them for $4000 or $5000 apiece. I used to think $100 but now I think that is my new price. I got the paper and there was an item about (laughs) how Lancome loved Isabella Rossellini in Blue Velvet so much that they renewed her contract for another five years.

I tried to talk him out of the Statue of Liberty and get him interested in the Heart paintings that I have been doing. Ran into Diane Von Furstenberg who said she is not going to go to Studio 54 anymore because she thinks it is wrong of Steve to be naming names.

As we were going upstairs Fred noticed that Joe Dallesandro was there so he went down to ask him to come up and join us but Joe said no and that began to bother Fred. So then Fred began drinking champagne. Lots of people there-Caroline of Monaco's fiance Philippe Junot Florence Grinda's brother and Pam Sakowitz who is getting divorced. Fred kissed her hand. Then Fred had an argument with a waiter about the fish forks. I asked Fred why he was so upset if that meant he would had an affair with Joe and he did not answer me. We learned more about Fred with every new champagne bottle. Then he decided to go and make Joe come up. Joe looked so dirty his teeth were so dirty like licorice. He talked loud said he drinks a bottle of bourbon a day. he is making a movie with Maria Schneider-they are playing zombies. He put down his girlfriend Stefania Cassini who left him. Said that he bought her $5000 necklaces that she would hide in the safe and then go run around Rome calling herself a Communist. Now he is having affairs with boys and girls-just anybody he said. He asked us to join him downstairs because he had a table. We said that we would be down. Later he came back and screamed that they were taking away his table so we should hurry up. He had some rich illustrator paying for it all. Joe started dancing with two black guys and Fred was getting drunker and started dancing with them too. I got so embarrassed that I left.

Walked over to the party at Bob Guccione's in my neighborhood. And Guccione said to me that the time seemed ""right"" now to really do porno photographs with celebrities and I put my foot in it I said (laughs) ""How about Cornelia Guest?"" I do not know what made me say it. Guccione was wearing a shirt and tie he had his gold chains covered over. I would heard he was in the hospital for a head tumor or something like that but maybe it was hair transplants. Pia had on a beautiful ring-a diamond with blue sapphires and she was wearing a Bob Mackie red white and with a blue star. It really was a beautiful dress. Slit up to the ass and when the wind blew once one of the photographers groaned ""Oh my God I missed a pussy shot."" And the funniest line was one Benjamin heard. When they showed the portraits one of the photographers said ""How could Andy Warhol sink to such mediocrity?"" and the photographer he said it to said ""What do you mean? he is famous for sinking to mediocrity."" And it is funny because there everybody is at this party for her and they still all put her down. Oh but I was gushing because Riklis came over and said ""How can we get the rest of the portraits? let us talk about it."" I was thrilled. I snuck out at 7:30. Left Jay there looking for Bunnies. Or whatever Penthouse has. Pets."

He arrived late. Sat around waiting for him and got mad. Found out Richard Gere was on the new cover of Rolling Stone complained to Interview that that was the reason he turned us down. Watched Mr. Goodbar and Richard Gere was in it and I hated him for turning us down. Actually he was so good in it though. could not watch the ending because it was too crazy."

They were going through their old covers and saw that I would done one of Jane. I sent Rupert out to get stats and he did not come back with the stuff until 7:30 so I yelled at him. Bob got back from California in the afternoon. He said he would gotten the John Savage interview finally so that is really great. He said he is never given an interview before so now maybe we will be able to get the heavier types who say Interview's too frivolous. At Ahmet and Mica Ertegun's party I played backgammon with Ahmet and lost four paintings to him we will have to see which ones.

Then at 8:00 he called and we talked. He said he was coming to the office that afternoon but he never made it. I had a 10:30 appointment with Dr. Linda Li who was recommended to me by Timothy Dunn a model who came by and by Joey the hairdresser (cab $4.50). she is a pretty Chinese lady and she told me to hold out my arm and push and then she would knock it away like karate and she said I was fine but I do not know what that meant. The Patty Cisneros lady Bob's friend who is so grand was waiting there and she looked fat. Then cabbed over to 720 Park Avenue to Emily Landau's lunch($5). Thomas Ammann was there and Fred arrived drunk talking like Mrs. Vreeland and being grand but he did talk about interesting things. Furniture and everything. She had beautiful black guys serving. she is the one who owned the apartment at Imperial House that Liza bought. I did her portrait but it never really looked good and the reason I wanted to do it again was because she has all these great paintings like Rauschenbergs and Picassos and I did not want to have mine looking bad there.

Well it was a mess. I was going to roll the paint on with a roller with the flowers on it and I was going to do it in pink and black but then Chris Makos had me change it to yellow and black and I started to roll it on and the paint was shiny and it slipped and it would not stick to the car model and Victor Bockris was there and I rolled it on him but it was a bust. Leo Castelli came by and almost got sick it was such a mess.

I thought it could not be anything great so I was forty-five minutes late ($3). The first person I saw when I walked in the door was Jackie O. looking beautiful. Then Norman Mailer. Jackie was talking to Jean's boyfriend who works for the Smithsonian. Delfina Rattazzi who still works for Jackie at Viking was there with such a complete new look I did not recognize her-curly hair and a sexy dress. Sue Mengers was there and she came over to me and said her knees were buckling that she would never been to a party like this. Babe Paley and her chairman-of-CBS husband went by and later when I saw Sue and Paley sitting together I remembered what Sue had told me in California that the only job she ever wanted was Paley's. I told Norman Mailer I loved him on the Academy Awards and he said he would just seen a video of how fast he would come down the ramp-Billy Friedkin had told him to do it that way. Renata Adler who writes for the New Yorker was there with Avedon. She said she is going to law school now at Yale but she thinks she will maybe drop out. She says it is so hard and that she can not remember anything. I had the first really nice talk with Jackie O. but I do not remember too much what it was about. The Magic of People in the Movies or something. Sue Mengers was running around this party bragging the same thing that she always brags-that she could offer President Carter a three-picture deal at $3 million a picture and that he would take it because everybody wants to be in the movies. So I pointed at Jackie and told Sue to go prove it but she was afraid she would not go over to her and make the offer. Andrew Young from the you.N. and another black guy were there. Sue was thrilled to meet them. Dennis Hopper told me he is directing Junkie the William Burroughs bio and I made a faux pas by telling him he should use Mick for the star because then Dennis said that he was the star. A son of Nick Dunne was there trying to be an actor now. Then Earl took me into the back rooms of the house and there were ten girls around seventeen or eighteen full-grown the age of Jean's daughter who is in college and they were like having a slumber party guessing at who was out there at the ""grownup"" party! But these girls were so old it was funny. They were thrilled to see me I signed the TV the armoire their hands everything. Every half-hour they would let one girl out and into the party. Dropped off Nick Dunne's son on 90th and Central Park West (cab $5)."

Watched the astronauts coming back on the shuttle on the Today Show. they are really cute. Did you ever notice how old they look after the space flights? They send up these good-looking guys and get back these tired-looking people. Went up to Carl Fischer's for my first Sony commercial. They were already waiting setting up. And they were talking about the other artists they would like to get for the series they mentioned Duchamp and Picasso. Seriously. I honestly do not think they knew they were dead. Maurice Sendak was the only other live one they mentioned besides me. And Peter Max. And they had some food in another room but they did not offer me any the execs were coming in eating cheese and saying things like ""This is a good spread"" things that sound just like the commercials. And people really do talk that way they really are like ad people. Everyone was telling me how wonnnnnnderful I looked thin but I feel so weak. Went to Xenon and that was fun. I met the Moynihan girl Maura and her roommate Aysie Senator Warner's daughter-her mother's a Mellon. And then my hair started to look too fake in the blue light so (laughs) I knew it was time to leave."

And Henry was supposed to be a friend. He looks terrific he is been going to the gym. But I think he is still wearing makeup like rouge. We were going to the Roy Cohn thing it was for convicts who make art prisoners who paint. There were about forty people there. Roy had borough presidents there and presidents of Revlon. And Cindy and Joey Adams were there and Joey gave a speech he said ""I thought this was a party for Roy's clients Ian and Steve. How come they do not paint?"" Andrew Crispo was an organizer of this thing and he bought a painting. It was embarrassing because I did not buy anything. Went home and glued myself and walked to Quo Vadis where we were interviewing Nastassia Kinski. She was very pretty and tall and spoke English well. We were afraid to ask her anything about Roman Polanski until the very end and then she told us she did not have an affair with him. She was interesting but not as fascinating as Jodie Foster. She speaks six languages and she could just redo every Ingrid Bergman movie. She looks like what Isabella Rossellini could look like. We dropped her off at the Navarro. she is been in town three weeks and wants to stay forever. she is staying with Milos Forman and I guess they are having an affair because she was saying something about making dinner for him during the Academy Awards. She was telling us that he offered her the best movie role the one of Evelyn Nesbit coming down the stairs naked in Ragtime and I did not have the heart to tell her that that is the role Milos offers every girl he is been going after -Margaret Trudeau and two others. it is his line. So we dropped her off (cab $5). Then we went to the Tavern on the Green party for the opening of The Watcher in the Woods. It was a party for Bette Davis that we got a telegram inviting us to. I went over to her and I thought we were friends because once I had a long conversation with her and she knew about when I was shot and was very sweet and everything. So I went over to her to refresh it and I said ""Oh hi-I am Andy Warhol remember?"" And she looked at me and said ""Yeeess."" And she turned around and walked away. And then later somebody at her table said ""Oh have you met Andy Warhol?"" and she said ""Yes I have met Andy Warhol."" Very cold. So I do not know what is wrong. Sylvia Miles was there and she ran to get her pocketbook with all her clippings in it from Hammett and from some other movie to show me. Lewis Allen was there. we are still talking to him about doing Exposures and the Philosophy book as a play."

She has John Savage and Meryl Streep for clients. John Fairchild Jr. called and invited me to see Manhattan on his father's tickets but I looked in the book and saw I had a dinner at Alice Mason's. she is the real estate person in New York who got Carter elected president. Dropped Rupert (cab $4). Went to 150 East 72nd Street. And I wanted to see her apartment because after all she is the big realtor and when I saw it you could not believe it it is just nothing on a sixth floor with (laughs) paint peeling. Nothing special at all. But it was a heavy-duty party. It was all big tall beautiful intellectual girls and old rich bachelors. A room full of heavies. Bess Myerson John and Mary Lindsay John Kluge. Jaquine Lachman who was so thrilled that Mr. Lachman died but now Rita an ex-Mrs. Lachman is giving her problems. The daughter of Alice Mason brought me into her mother's bedroom where my Carter portrait was and other photos of her with Carter. They had funny art around the house. At around 12:15 I slipped out.

Before he went into the hospital he was home for weeks he said from a bad flu. He came in for a business lunch once though and I asked Gael why he had round little bandages on and she said he would just had moles removed and that sounded reasonable. Then there was a lunch at the office for Charles Jourdan shoes (cab $6). Jay came to work glowing he is in love with our fashion editor Kate Harrington. And I said I thought she was going with John Sykes of MTV and Jay said ""Listen she broke up with him the day she met me"" so I mean I did not want to get into that. Kate has eyes for everyone. she is so bubbly so pretty. let us hope Jay stays in this good mood. And Jean Michel Basquiat was after Kate too-she styled an Interview shoot of him and de Antonio in Armani clothes and he left five joints for her. Victor called a couple of times and now he always brings up that I said he could be dangerous and he always mentions Valerie Solanis. he is staying at the Barbizon now he said Halston's changing the locks. He thinks Victor's stealing his Peretti candlesticks but actually he just borrowed them to leave with the Barbizon as a security deposit. Victor gave me two at Christmas but that was with Halston there and it was only on the condition that Halston could get more of them. If he could not then I was supposed to give them back. But Tiffany does have more of them-I checked."

He said that he never buys hot stones or cheap stones that he just waits for the good things and pays the price. We walked over to Pearls in the rain for lunch and it was fun. On the way in we saw Corice Arman waiting for Arman who was parking the car. John and I talked about Holocaust and I always thought that John was born in Europe because he has sort of an accent but he was born in the you.S. I guess he needs the accent for the diamond business. Pearl made a good lunch we had whiskey. John had a kid staying with him and his wife who-he would reminded me of Rene Ricard when I met him-I said was a creep and then I had to explain how when I say ""creep"" it does not mean that I do not like them and that took an hour. After work I had to leave for Eleanor Lambert's cocktail party for Bernadine Morris the New York Times fashion writer who is done a photograph book with a girl photographer on fashion. I was talking to Calvin Klein and he said he was going on vacation and I said where and he said ""And I am not telling anyone and just alone alone alone absolutely no one and it will be so wonderful."" And then I went across the room and Giorgio Sant'Angelo was saying the same thing that he was going for two weeks alone alone alone to the Greek islands and I said ""Are you sure you are not going with Calvin Klein?"" and he said ""Oh you know everything"" and I said no that I would just put two and two together. And Diane Von Furstenberg was there and she lives in Eleanor Lambert's building so she invited Bob and me down for dinner and to watch Holocaust. So we went down and Diane's mother was there and Marina Cicogna. Diane's mother had been in Auschwitz and when the concentration camps came on she was laughing-she said that they made it so much more glamorous than it was when she was there that all the women had crewcuts and it was a lot more crowded that where the movie had 20 people there were really 300000. And it was weird to be seeing this with Marina Cicogna whose family was so involved with Mussolini. Before it was over Diane was ready to go out she was calling for a limousine."

When we came to the outskirts of Rome the driver did not know how to get into the city. We had to follow a cab to take us to Graziella's office to pick up two tickets to have a private audience with the pope. Suzie was very upset because it was too exclusive for her to go so she gave Fred her cross to have blessed. We got our tickets and then the driver dropped us off at the Vatican. When we saw 5000 other people standing around waiting for the pope too I just knew that Graziella had not gotten us a private audience. But Fred put on airs and went up to the guards and said that we had a private audience with the pope and they laughed. They finally took us in to our seats with the rest of the 5000 people and a nun screamed out ""you are Andy Warhol! Can I have your autograph?"" She looked like Valerie Solanis so I got scared she would pull out a gun and shoot me. Then I had to sign five more autographs for other nuns. And I just get so nervous at church. And then the pope came out he was on a gold car he did the rounds and then finally he got up and gave a speech against divorce in seven different languages. There was a bunch of cheerleaders saying ""Rah-rah pope."" That took three hours. It was really boring and then finally the pope was coming our way. He shook everybody's hand and Fred kissed his ring and got Suzie's cross blessed. He asked Fred where he was from and Fred said New York and I was taking pictures-there were a lot of photographers around-and he shook my hand and I said I was from New York too. I did not kiss his hand. The people next to me were giving him a gold plate they were from Belgium. The mobs behind us were jumping down from their seats it was scary. Then Fred was going to take a Polaroid but I said they would think it was a machine gun and shoot us so we never got a Polaroid of the pope. As soon as Fred and I got blessed we ran out. We decided it would be fun to make up a good story to tell Suzie so we went to have lunch on the Piazza Navona ($45). We made up that we would had a private audience with the pope and that he liked Fred so much that he asked us to lunch and then he forgot to give us back Suzie's cross."

I always say to them that I will call them and interview them but I have got to stop staying that because it is ridiculous-like I am so sure they want to be interviewed. At 8:15 went to the Iranian embassy (cab $3). Hoveyda seemed nervous. It was a party for a man who used to be the chief editor of Newsweek Osborn Elliott. I was next to Mrs. Astor and on my other side Frank Perry. Mrs. Astor said she wished she had a tail so she could shake hands with people and hold cocktails and put on lipstick all at once.

So I am half expecting the police to come and question me about why I was pumping Alexander for information. And what happened was someone painted a regular diamond with clear pink nail polish and switched it for the expensive pink one. Oh and I look so bad I need a facelift. Makeup does not do it you still see the sunken cheeks and the neck-you can not hide the neck even with a turtleneck. The Debbie Harry wrestling play Teaneck Tanzi was at 6:45. I invited John O'Connor from Interview and then Gael Love called up and said that he could not go anywhere with me because he had to go to the Interview party at Reginette's. She was really trying to push me around she said ""And I want you there too."" I said ""Oh fine Gael sure."" Gael is so pushy now Bob must have really kept her down."

The makeup girl covered my pimple then I was put on the plane next to a lady in a grey wig. My line was that I had to pick up a bagel and say ""What is art?"" and I could not get it right- the first time I said ""What is a bagel?""-and I had to do twenty takes. Oh and I could just scream at Paul Morrissey because I open the paper and I see that Frankenstein is now playing in fifty theaters and during this time when he is quibbling and nitpicking with me about every little dot in this formal contract he wanted made up to spell out what percentages he owns of which movies and while he is having his lawyer Chase Mellen write up every little thing-like in twenty years if I am not around what happens-here Ponti or some Mafia company or somebody is making a fortune off Frankenstein so why was not Paul on top of that? I think I am now going to really read the contract he wants me to sign and then I will say that I will not sign things until they are even more spelled out-I mean what happens if he is not around in twenty years? I do not want to have to negotiate with his mother over foreign rights. I think I will do that. Yeah I think I will. And have I mentioned that Mrs. Rupert Murdoch wrote me a letter about saving the church? The one on 66th Street that I go to St. Vincent Ferrer. it is in danger of people not going to it.

And the Laroche people told about being in the same building with Adolfo and how the Adolfo people spray their perfume in the lobby and then the Guy Laroche people come and scrub it down and put theirs and back and forth. Billy Boy came by to see Gael for something and I caught him before he left and invited him up and it was a good thing I did because he entertained those Shiseido people he just filled up the lunch with Barbie talk.

In the morning went to Dr. Bernsohn's and Bernsohn said that Reese felt I was a ""Janooky"" that he felt I could be the really big one. ""Janookys"" are the head crystal people. Left there and ran into David Whitney and invited him to lunch to find out about the art business. He said that Peter Brant paid $40000 for a Jasper Johns print. For a print! Vincent was upset because Polygram called and said that Lou Reed does not want to get back with the Velvets. And Polygram wants to buy our tapes for $15000 which is not enough. And I mean I just do not understand why I have never gotten a penny from that first Velvet Underground record. That record really sells and I was the producer! should not I get something? I mean should not I? And what I can not figure out is when Lou stopped liking me. I mean he even went out and got himself two dachshunds like I had and then after that he started not liking me but I do not know exactly why or when. Maybe it was when he married this last wife maybe he decided that he did not want to see peculiar people. I am surprised he has not had kids you know? I worked on the Lana Turner portraits turning this sixty-year-old into a twenty-five-year-old girl. It took a long time.

Fred had given me a winter coat and I really needed it it was freezing. At the end of the eighth inning when we left it was 0-0 and on the way in on the radio it was still 0-0 (toll $.75). Averil dropped her mother's car off at the 52nd Street garage and then we got a cab for Elaine's. Bob was having a dinner for Baron Leon Lambert from the Belgian bank so he had Chris Makos and Catherine Guinness and Catherine was wearing a T-shirt that said ""Where is Palestine?"" Her great-grandfather was Lord Moyne of Palestine who got assassinated there in 1944 by the Stern Gang. She asked Leon if he was Jewish. And he is half-Jewish his mother's some kind of Rothschild. And Catherine said ""I do not give a damn. Do you realize that if Hitler had won the war my step-grandfather would be dictator of England?"" Sir Oswald Mosley. The founder of the British Fascist Party. But Bob said Catherine and Leon seemed to hit it off anyway. Then Chris's boyfriend arrived Peter Wise. So we went over (cab $3.25) to Studio 54's anniversary party. We got out on West 53rd Street and went in the back way because there were mobs out front. We went to the basement with all the gold pillows and the ceiling sounded like it was going to fall through from the dancing. Halston said we should (laughs) rehearse for later when they brought the cake in and we had to give speeches so he rehearsed his speech. Truman had a tin-foil hat band around his black hat and I was talking to him when YSL walked in with Marina and he gave Halston a really big kiss so that was Fashion News. Yves looked like he could have been on something. Then we went upstairs and sat on a piano in front of the curtain and the cake never arrived and Halston made a speech about how much Studio 54 has done for New York and he was good and then he said ""And now I will pass the mike to Andy."" But I already had a mike in my hand and it is bad enough not having anything to say when you are holding one mike but I just said ""Uh uh oh gee uhhh ..."" I do not know I just made sounds and you could not have heard it anyway and people laughed and then Bianca said something and it might as well have been in Nicaraguan because you could not understand it and then she passed the mike to Liza who was wearing a red Halston and she sang something like ""Embraceable You"" but it was from The Act and it had lines like ""Forget Donald Brooks/Halston has all the looks.""

Jon called back and said his rented car was towed from 75th and Columbus and that it was my fault because I would told him it would not be. He thought it was stolen but then the police called Hertz. Donna one of the girls in Can Can called and invited me to the show on Saturday and I called Tom Cashin to find out if Jed was going because if he was I did not want to go. Donna's the girl from Best Little Whorehouse who Tom was seeing during the show. She understudies the other girl and on Thursdays she does a real role. Faye from Halston's called and wanted to know if I wanted to be his date for the opening of Little Foxes on May 7 but that is Jon's birthday.

She has her hair straight now and her dress showed everything in the right way. But I think this boyfriend is the one who directed the horrible video for the song she has out now ""Emotion"" but I am not sure. And she is suing her building in New York because of the roof-it leaks. it is at 92nd and Central Park West and she did not even remember that she would invited me to a party there this was about seven or nine years ago-Jed and I went-and she said ""I knew you? Were you famous then when you came to my party?"" As if she would have invited me if I were not. And I felt like telling her ""Yes I was there and you had name tags stuck on all the food like a delicatessen- 'chopped liver' and 'gefilte fish' and I do not know 'halvah.' "" It was getting to that point where I might as well have. I told her ""Oh your jewelry is so small Barbra why do not you get bigger things?"" And she said ""Oy! I bought diamonds for $60000 a carat and the next day they dropped to $20000!"" And it is true it really happened like that about three years ago. But I told her that the day they went down to $20000 she should have bought three more and cut her losses. And Sean Connery was there but I did not talk to him. And Alan Ladd Jr. who looked sensational. And they all talk about Jews trying to be WASPs and they were talking about Woody Allen and Mia Farrow and really putting down Mia."

We had tried to get Rachel Ward but her agency said no. I decided to go see Cat People. Was picked up by Jon and went to the Gemini (cab $3 tickets $10). I really liked the movie so much. I guess I really like the Scarfiotti art direction. And this time I really loved the arm being bitten off and how they did it and the snap when it came out of the socket.

It was so weird. It was like clowns. Everybody was a clown in a funny way and they were just living there without letting me know they would come out in the morning when I was not there and they would have a lot of fun and then they would go back and live in the closet. And so I got up and Christopher had left all the lights on and the windows were open and it was very beautiful. Went to hunt for the loden coat I was trying to buy for Jon Gould. And Bruno Bischofberger said the best loden coats were in Zurich and Fred said the best were in Paris. But I think the best ones are in Vienna. Then we had to meet a kid named Andre Heller who has gold records and he owns all these paintings and wants me to do a drawing for his album cover. He was taking us down underground to show us dead people who're petrified and they are all in their eighteenth-century clothes. Fred said it might be a good idea to go that maybe we would get ideas there. So we met him and he gave us about twenty boxes of candy. Then we went down into the catacombs and we had to oooh and ahh at all the dead bodies and it was really cold down there and he would made us leave our candy behind and we did not want to do that but we did and this place was just hateful. I hated it a lot. Fred loved it. Then Bruno took us back to the hotel. Fred wanted to go for another walk but Christopher wanted to go cruising in the park so we just threw our stuff down and walked the whole park and that was good exercise.

There were press people outside they took some pictures but there were not any really big stars. Suzie Frankfurt and Patti LuPone were there and a 6'11"" basketball player I do not know his name he was white really cute he kept trying to be friendly. Miz Lillian was in the other room.

And LeRoy Neiman was there he is doing a drawing of Miz Lillian for the Daily News. Then we went and found Miz Lillian talking to Barbara Walters. Lillian keeps saying the portrait I did of her raised $65000 but I never heard a thing about that. They brought out a cake and I taped the ""Happy Birthday."" Then LeRoy said he had a car downstairs and we could ride in it so we all left with Miz Lillian. And it was an actual car not a limo. My tape jammed and I put in another one and it jammed too so then I knew it was not the tape that the Secret Service guy had done it. He was cute. People were looking and waving at the car they had Miz Lillian balloons. She said ""Every smile is a vote."" At the hotel there were sisters and brothers and cousins from Georgia. She said ""Sis!"" to one but I do not know if it was really her sister. We went up to the penthouse and then took another elevator to the next floor to her room and she said when times were better she used to have a whole suite. LeRoy was drawing those terrible drawings of his asking her questions saying anything to her. It was great. He told dirty jokes and she told them back. Like his was one about a bear using a rabbit after every crap to wipe himself and she laughed. she would left the liquor that Phyllis George sent at Richard's and someone went back for it. Phyllis George is sending a lot of things she wanted her husband to introduce Jimmy or something like that but Miz Lillian said it was impossible that it was protocol. Phyllis also sent two pictures of her baby. She also sent Miz Lillian a sequined jacket and Miz Lillian said ""Now how could I wear that."" I gave her a Philosophy book. I ignored Ruth Carter Stapleton because I did not recognize her. There were a lot of Secret Service in the room because Carter was next door or a few doors down. I felt like a groupie. Miz Lillian was putting down Harvard people she hates them she was just on the point of calling some Harvard guy she was in the Peace Corps with a fairy but she did not. I told Le Roy he was such a good interviewer that I wished he would work for Interview. He said he could talk so freely with Miz Lillian because she reminded him of his own mother. I left him and took a walk down the avenue. I was signing autographs and a girl came over and handed me an ""I Love New York"" button and then she asked me for money and actually I was about to give her something but then she was so horrible and aggressive that I handed the thing back to her and she grabbed my finger and slammed it in her book and squeezed it and I was going to hit her with my tape recorder. I passed out Interviews and then at 4:00 had an appointment with the H&R Blocks at the office (cab $3.60). The office was busy. They brought their daughter and I think a senator from Missouri. they are from Kansas City. They were thrilled with the office. I gave them a Popism. Worked till 7:30 dropped Vincent (cab $5).

And I picked up the phone yesterday and it was Dolly Parton and she was cute she said ""Hey Andy! You know who this is?"" And I said ""Oh God with that voice ..."" And what she wants to give her agent Sandy Gallin is a portrait of her and she asked how much it was and I just was too embarrassed I said she would really have to talk to Fred or Vincent for that. She said she was leaving for L.A. Friday afternoon so we made a date to take the picture at 11:00 on Friday morning so I hope it works out. They should be getting the Stallone issue in today. Everybody was talking about the Stallone interview-they said he sounds smart. Is that possible?"
"Wednesday, August 15, 1984",[Jack Nicholson],0.036982323232323235,"I am still looking for ideas. This fall it will be a whole new look new people. Because five years into the decade is when it really becomes a decade. The eighties. they will be looking over all the people and picking the ones from the last five years that'll survive as the eighties people. it is when the people from the first five years will either become part of the future or part of the past. Worked till 4:30. Cab to the crystal doctor and this time it was a real experience. This session was like an exorcism. He had me lie down on his table and close my eyes and then he asked me ""Do you know where you are?"" and I kept saying ""Well what do you mean?"" and he kept saying ""Do you know where you are?"" And I kept saying ""What do you mean?"" and finally I said I was lying on his table and he said ""Oh I thought you might not know because your eyes were closed."" And he would touch me here and there and when I would not have any reaction he said that I was not in touch with my pain. But it did not hurt is the thing. But he said it was because I was not sensitive to the pain yet and that I would have to become sensitive to it. And he took my crystal and asked it ""How long? One minute? Two minutes? One hour? One day?"" And at four days the crystal told him yes so that is how long it is going to take for this crystal to be programmed. I said that I could go and get another one that'll be ready sooner. He said no. So I am going to wait four days and then I have to have it with me always and not more than ten feet away when I am asleep. I really do believe that all this hokum-pokum helps though. it is positive thinking. And it is why people wear gold and jewels. It does have something. And if you wear pearls around a stone it does do something for you. He said I had some negative powers in me and I asked him how long I would have to come to him and he did not tell me. it is so abstract. But you do feel better when you get out. And the funniest thing was I picked up some chiropractor magazine and Jack Nicholson our Interview cover boy was on the cover of that too. Standing with this chiropractor to the stars. I had a fight with Fred. His attitude is so-it is like he is a magazine-editor-on-the-phone. And I do not know if he is on the ball or not. I know he is doing his best but ..."

The townspeople hate Tom because he rides a horse into town and the band has drugs. Finally it turned out it was really nothing that the plumber's assistant had told the police he saw so many guns around and so Tom had to talk his way out of it telling the police about the movie they were shooting and that they needed the guns for it.

Went down to meet Jean Michel Basquiat and did a workout with him and Lidija (cab $5). And he has b.o. it is like Chris who also thinks it is sexy when you exercise to have b.o. but I want to say it sure is not. And all this b.o. has made me think about my life and how I am not really missing anything great. I mean I think of Paige having sex with Jean Michel Basquiat and I think how could she do it. I mean what do you do say some hint like ""Uh gee why do not we do something wild like take a shower together?"" John Sex came by. He said his python was home molting so it was cranky. Saw the show Vincent's working on and it looks really good. We got a great writeup in one of the video magazines. Whitney Tower called and he was having a party at Club A (cab $5). Whitney's going crazy because his father's young wife had another baby. Cornelia called him and said ""Congratulations you are a brother again!"" And his mind is dividing the fortune watching his share go down one more time. Then Madelaine Netter sat down and told me about how she would been attacked in an elevator on West 96th Street. They had her on the floor and were ripping her clothes off and she was screaming and suddenly she got the idea to say ""Jesus saves."" And they freaked out and glued her back together."
"Wednesday, August 2, 1978","[Fritz Mondale, Helen Frankenthaler, Max Ernst]",0.023255389391753038,"-New York-Washington D.C. Life really does repeat itself. The old songs come back in a new way and the kids think they are new and the old people remember and it is a way of keeping people together I guess a way of living. We got the Washington shuttle after getting magazines and newspapers ($3). The shuttle was packed it always is. Paid for Fred's and my ticket ($81). Then got a cab to the Madison Hotel ($6.50) checked the baggage ($3). Cab to the Mondales' ($4). Everything is so expensive. It started me noticing inflation for the first time because everything on the menu at the hotel was actually double. A minute steak that used to be $7.50 is $15 now. And all your life you are taught-you are brought up on money on pennies and dollars and the inflation used to come in pennies but now a dollar is like a penny things go up in dollars. Washington was hot and sticky. Joan and Fritz Mondale did not have any real big artists. Just Helen Frankenthaler and me. And the reason I was included was because they had the Southwest collection and my Blue Flowers was in Mrs. de Menil's gift. They live in the same house the Rockefellers had when they were vice-presidents but of course their Max Ernst bed is gone from the place now. Joan put me on her left and an Indian guy on her right. And then Joan was a little drunk I think and she started being very sad and saying ""Well this is probably the last time we will see each other because you are a famous artist and you are going to be around for a long time but they just took a poll in New Jersey and we are the lowest we have ever been we are lower than Nixon right before they got him out and we are slipping fast."" I told her that things would pick up. Then we saw the treasury guy over in a corner and I said to Joan that he should make dollar bills that have braille for the blind newsdealers like they do in Switzerland and she said that was a wonderful idea that I should tell him but then she got to him first and told him herself. The dinner was so bad. What ruined food in America? Was it those magazines like Good Housekeeping and Family Circle and McCall's? They could have great simple steak-and-potatoes dinners and instead they have these fancy concoctions. Like veal with tuna sauce on top of it and capers. It was a ""tented affair"" and that always costs so much every time you put up a tent. And they had every kind of hard liquor which you do not get now at the White House. Then around 10:00 Helen Frankenthaler slipped a note over asking us if we wanted to leave. Then we had to go back to the hotel and I would been telling Fred how horrible Helen Frankenthaler was how awful she was to me last weekend and then suddenly she was changed. She said ""I have been so awful lately I do not know what is wrong. I am really going to be nice tonight."" And then she was! is not it amazing how a person can just change like ""that"" because they decide to? And we had drinks with her in the hotel. Fred was bored with her but he paid for the drinks anyway. She was talking about her maid wanting $300 for four days' work she is live-in. She probably just wants to leave Helen. Helen has three or four people working for her she said. And she hated the wine although Fred did not see anything wrong with it."

I met him for dinner to discuss the Patti LuPone interview and I invited Rupert too because we had to discuss the Florida trip with Ron Feldman. We met at Le Relais (dinner $130). When I got home I called Bob and we talked until 3:00 in the morning because I was waiting for Jed to get home. He was having dinner with Alan Wanzenberg the architect-he is working with Jed now on the Brants' house in Palm Beach.
"Wednesday, August 22, 1984",[Richard Pryor],0.23257575757575757,Gael Love called and said she signed the deal with the Swatch people where if you buy two subscriptions to Interview you get one Swatch and if you buy two Swatches you get one subscription. She thinks it will bring in 30000 new subscriptions. And this morning I woke up to The Toy with Richard Pryor and it is funny. I asked PH to write him a letter from me saying that I wanted her to do the first part of an interview with him when she is in L.A. next week and that I would then do the second half myself when he comes to New York and I signed the letter and sent a Philosophy book so we will wait to hear.

I told him how did he expect any of the kids at Interview to work hard when he was still in bed at noon and then he said that he would rush right down. Later I heard him telling Brigid that he would met a deaf-mute and that he was with him when I called. Brigid was typing away and then I caught her eating candy and when I did she went crazy she felt so awful I had to quiet her down. I told her ""Now now it is not so bad you only had fifteen pieces the day's still young just take it calm and easy."" Picked up Catherine and Jed in a cab ($4) and went to Madison Square Garden to see Bruce Springsteen (tickets $19). we would gone on Monday night too but only saw the last few seconds of the show. So this time we got there right before he started and we sat right down in the orchestra 30000 kids in the place. They were all young and cute and why does not Interview appeal to them? It should it is young and modern. My head must not be in the same place because they were all jumping up and screaming for Bruce and I was the only one who did not. Oh and Susan Blond called me earlier and said that a girl had called her up because she was upset because Bruce Springsteen was upset because he said I would taken his picture on Monday night. She said that he does not like anybody to take pictures-that his girlfriend's a photographer and even she can not take his picture. But the funny thing is I would just gotten my contact sheets back and I was sitting there trying to figure out what night I was looking at and who I would taken a picture of-I did not even recognize that it was Bruce Springsteen-I thought it was Al Pacino. I would forgotten where I went! Why is Bruce Springsteen big though? He talks the dumb way. Like Sylvester Stallone. Is that why these people are big? Because they talk that way and people identify? He does work really hard."
"Wednesday, August 24, 1983",[Karen Burke],0.11333333333333334,It was a beautiful day. I left the house early in order to go see Karen Burke to get collagen injections. She wears high heels and rides a bike which is so dangerous. After the injections Dr. Karen walked me all the way to 66th Street. The injections did make me bleed on my face. The lines on the sides.

Decided to stay uptown because Mercedes Kellogg was giving a lunch and somehow I was invited and I thought it would be a good chance to corner Bob about the Bloomingdale death gossip because he would be there too. Cabbed to Park and 74th ($2). It turned out to be a birthday party for Claus von Bulow. And Doris Duke was there with Franco Rossellini. He said that Isabella's getting a million and a half for one of her modeling contracts and that she and Marty Scorsese are still trying to work it out. So when I had Bob cornered in the cab I asked him about the Bloomingdale death because it came out in the press on Sunday or Monday that he had died on Friday and Bob had seen Betsy Friday night out in California but Bob said that Jerry Zipkin knew but kept it a big secret and had not even told Bob when he and Bob went out to the supermarket together.
"Wednesday, August 26, 1981",[],0.1722222222222222,I am just so undecided between those two buildings the one on Madison and 33rd and the 895 Broadway one. Because the one on Madison is so great and big and artistic and it might be a goldmine across from the Empire State Building but then it would cost so much to fix it up and how would you do it? But they do have a 12 percent mortgage we could get which would make it good. But then this 895 one is practical it is $1.8 as opposed to the Madison one which is $2 but you would have floors renting and the income coming in. I do not know. And Fred's in the same dilemma.

Closed up early. Dropped Robyn and Fred (cab $5.50). The Doc was a little late he finally arrived in a limo. He told me that he would broken up with his nineteen-year-old boyfriend because the kid got too jealous. The kid was a weirdo. Charles Rydell was in the movie he was a cabdriver. He was good. Taylor Mead was in the movie for a minute as a drunk doing a bit. I thought the movie was great but Bianca Ina Bob and Doc Cox all hated it. And they had doctor things in the movie so the Doc was whispering things like ""that is not right that is not the way you do it."" Then we were meeting Tammy Grimes at Elaine's. Helen Frankenthaler came to our table and she was so drunk. I said ""Would you like to meet Bianca Jagger?"" and she waved her hand and said ""I do not care about that."" She said she wanted me to come to her table and meet Clement Greenberg and Kenneth Noland she said she thought it would be fascinating so I went there. Then Tammy came and we reminisced about the old days. I once drew her feet. She looked pretty good. I confronted her again and said ""I just know it is your voice on those TV commercials because nobody could imitate your voice and you told me it was not you and I just know it is."" And then she confessed that it was."

And Fred just sort of laughed and said when they raise more money to call back. Anyway they sent the script over and I could not figure out which part would be mine. They said I was a ""Puerto Rican crook"" but everybody on Miami Vice is a Puerto Rican crook. Gael looks really great now thin. She came in and Chris predicted it was going to be about a birthday present and (laughs) it was. Asked Wilfredo to the dinner that Paige was giving at Texarkana for advertisers (cab $5). This is part of Paige's new strategy because she got so sick of all the under-people stalling for so long about ads that she decided to only invite the presidents of the companies out and it turns out a lot of times they do not have anything to do they are bored and they are just dying to go out. Dropped Wilfredo (cab $10). And then I got home and watched some Letterman and he had on Eddie Murphy who was cool and casual and then Dick Cavett came on and he was really funny. he is gotten more gay-looking and -acting and Letterman was nervous because Cavett was so funny he just sort of faded out of the picture. Dick was really working his ass off using funny intellectual words and making puns."

Walked to the office. Fred had the papers and we were reading about Studio 54 and really laughing it up. Then the phone rang and it was the FBI and we stopped laughing. I would not take the call I had Fred talk to them and they are coming to see me today. Then Halston called and said the FBI had just been to see him too but he said he would not say over the phone what happened. it is funny they are wasting their time on this stuff. do not they have a Ten Most Wanted list anymore? I mean they are trying to find Barry Landau who everybody else is trying not to find! Rupert and I worked on the Ten Most Famous Jews series. I have not been told for sure yet who'se in it. Sarah Bernhardt. Maybe Woody Allen. Charlie Chaplin Freud Modigliani Martin Buber. Who is Martin Buber? The Guggenheims. Oh and Einstein. And Gertrude Stein. Kafka (photos for research $2.20). I think they were considering Bob Dylan but I read that he turned born-again Christian.

He wanted to buy the Great Jones Street carriage house from me but I told him that together with our other one around the corner from it on the Bowery it was a nice lot and that we might put a theater on it some day. He and Paige had a big fight because they had a date for 9:00 and he did not show up till 1:00. And I am so mad at Scavullo. Those pictures he did of me for the Jordan Marsh catalogue he made me look so ugly. He did not air-brush at all and he is an air-brush queen! But he did not do it for me. I would like to call him up and tell him off but then he would say ""We can only work with what you give us darling."" Nelson called and said that Joe Dallesandro is driving a cab in L.A. Why can not Joe just get some woman to support him? Or somebody. He still has a big dick. he is stupid. S-T-you-P-I-D. And I do not know what happened with Heat. They were showing it on Friday night at the New York Film Festival-they were doing a series on movies that had opened there in the past. I did not hear a thing about it. Then Christopher wanted to have dinner. He said he had not eaten all day so he promised that he would actually eat the dinner and not have it wrapped to take home. We thought of the Water Club but then decided on the Jockey Club at the Ritz Carlton (dinner $250 with tip)."

Mrs. Trump is six months pregnant. I showed them the paintings of the Trump Tower that I would done. I do not know why I did so many I did eight. In black and grey and silver which I thought would be so chic for the lobby. But it was a mistake to do so many I think it confused them. Mr. Trump was very upset that it was not color-coordinated. They have Angelo Donghia doing the decorating so they are going to come down with swatches of material so I can do the paintings to match the pinks and oranges. I think Trump's sort of cheap though I get that feeling. And Marc Balet who set up the whole thing was sort of shocked. But maybe Mrs. Trump will think about a portrait because I let them see the portraits of Lynn Wyatt behind the building paintings so maybe they will get the idea. Jon called from Hollywood.

I took a sleeping pill but it acted more like an up. I really feel like an old-timer this time. I can not believe I am so old because that means (laughs) that Brigid's old too. it is too abstract. I can not even squish a roach anymore because it is just like a life like living. I glued myself together and wanted to walk. Got a lot of phone calls about my birthday. Todd Brassner called and I told him to come down and bring me a present but he did not. Victor Hugo sent orchids with beautiful ribbons. From Renny that must be a very chic place. I had an appointment with Chris Makos at 860 (cab $5.50). Then the kids kept coming by. Curley brought me a piece of junk an airplane light. I asked him to stay for lunch. Richard Weisman called to say he was coming down. I said I was going to 65 Irving for lunch and to meet us there. We went over ten of us. Pingle-the Princess Ingeborg Schleswig-Holstein-came who works at Interview now. she is related to Queen Elizabeth. And Brigid came. We were having pina coladas and then strawberry daiquiris and then Richard had the idea to have blueberry daiquiris. It was fun. Rupert gave me 300 ties. Robert Hayes gave me a silver set of Elvis records every record he ever made. Mimi Trujillo brought two dresses to show me and Victor made her give them to me they are great. Then I had to go to the theater. Halston sent a singing telegram that had three people singing it. They were awful. they are trying to be in show business and I asked them not to exaggerate it and to sing it quietly. Halston sent a big cake in the shape of a shoe and it must have been the best cake because Brigid ate all of it. I glued and was late but then Susan Johnson was even later and I screamed at her. Stephen was already inside on the aisle when we got there. Annie was wonderful (cab $6). It was packed you would never think there was a recession. Standing room. The audience loved it mostly old people. I was trying to keep awake. Afterwards we went backstage. I did not see Alice Ghostley. I went to school with her husband. We got a dumpy limo outside to go to Mr. Chow's. Mr. and Mrs. Chow greeted us. I did not want to sign the guest book there because I wanted to do it with my own pen the next time. Tina Chow wished me happy birthday. We had champagne. Robin Williams came in and said hello I asked him to join us but he said he was at the bar with someone that he would see. With some lady friend. And then I remembered that somebody told me he met a girl the day he married his wife and that they have been having an affair ever since. Anyway he did not come back. He had a short-sleeved shirt on and his arms are so hairy that is how Susan recognized him. I hope Popeye is a hit for him because his TV show just died. Stephen invited a girl to join us for dinner a sculptress who lives down near Rupert. She made a sculpture out of a napkin as a present for me but then we did not notice when the waiter took it away. Stephen was nervous and he almost started drinking. We dropped him on 57th and Second then I dropped Susan (cab $5).

Paige was getting together an advertising dinner for that night which I was afraid was just going to be a birthday dinner disguised so I told her she would better have at least four advertisers there or there would be trouble. The day got strange when Kenny Scharf called and said that Martin Burgoyne was with his family in Florida sick. That what they thought was the measles was not. And I said that the people we knew who had ""it"" had had the best care money can buy and they were the first to go so I did not know what to say. And Florida seems like a healthy place to be. Madonna was in the papers buying books on Columbus Avenue for ""a sick friend"" so I guess that was Martin. Got to Caffe Roma at 8:00 and it was Stephen Sprouse and Debbie Harry and Chris Stein who looked handsome and Debbie had to leave early to go work on her new record. And there was a Polaroid guy there and I finally told him that if Polaroid did not advertise at this point I was never going to use their name again in my life and he said ""Oh do not say that do not let it mean we can not be friends."" And he gave me something he said was very meaningful to him (laughs)-it was a Polaroid. Of a sunset. Tama's going to be rooming with Paige when she comes up from Princeton University on weekends she is going to be ""in residence"" down there. We bought the rights to all of Tama's stories in Slaves of New York about living with Ronnie-I mean with ""Stash"" and Vincent is looking for financing to make it into a feature movie."

I had a dinner date with Fred last night and Bob Denison and his new wife so I could not go with Karen Lerner and Steve Aronson to see John-John Kennedy in his play at the Irish Theater-it is invitations only you have to be invited by someone in the cast. John-John turned us down for the Interview cover. I guess he would have to give away too much talk to be on our cover but with People he will just get a big story and not have to say a thing. Bob Denison married the kind of girl that his kind of person should marry-upturned nose blonde sort of the Joan Lunden-type a little past thirty she was in a Valentino dress and she had a good sapphire ring on. She does the morning Today Show the segments on beauty and fashion. I do not know her name. And I was complaining so much about money that Bob gave me a dollar and I had the wife sign it so I could find out her name but then I could not read her name and Bob never called her anything. And Fred's still talking with a British accent. He is smart though that is the good thing. He knows how to bring up topics which I do not know how to do. And we talked about the chic-est perfume and the chic-est man and the chic-est show and the chic-est car. On the way home from Le Cirque this well-dressed guy with a briefcase stopped Fred and me and said his wallet had just been stolen and everything and Fred believed him and gave him money. I did not though because a real person would not ask they would do something else go someplace else. But Fred gave him money and he went toward the subway. But then Fred realized he would left his umbrella so we went back and there was the guy doing the same thing to somebody else. And Fred screamed at him that he was a crook.

Fred brought in the pictures of Liza and they were horrible. I mean they were clear and sharp but Liza's not fat and they made her look fat and like a drag queen. The expressions were wrong too. Richard Bernstein's going to have to do a big creative job on them for the Interview cover. Later that night we cabbed to Studio 54 ($4). Steve was at the door and he said that Valerie and Robin Williams were inside and he brought me over to them. There've been stories in the papers that they were getting divorced but Valerie said it was not true. Cheryl Tiegs came in with Peter Beard and I guess she wanted to have her picture taken with Robin but Valerie said no no pictures. Valerie's very tough she runs things and then she turned to me and asked if I thought it was okay that she was that tough if she should be. She said that Robin was invited to Fire Island for the weekend but she did not want him to go. She said ""It would be too big a strain on both of us."" So then I thought that maybe she is afraid he could be a fairy. She said she wanted them to go someplace like Nantucket instead. I introduced her to a cute waiter named Robert who was not working and she seemed sort of hot for him and they danced but then she got nervous-maybe she would just wanted to get Robin jealous for a minute. he is still wearing the clothes we bought that day down in the Village. he is got such a funny-shaped body. Steve was smoking a joint and when the person who gave it to him wanted it back Steve started screaming."

And he was a lot better-looking than I remember when I last met him. Actually handsome. With this blonde. I do not know if she was in the movie too. It was really hot and muggy in the truck the air conditioner was not working too well and I was going to invite them into my house but the air-conditioning there was not much better. I was considering it really I was. And it was hard to hear because the air conditioner in the truck was going. He said he would just seen Bad a couple of months ago. I wonder if the little gold cross he was wearing was his own or for the movie."

As we left about fifteen Negro kids with brooms were going to the park to sweep up some city clean-up program to give them jobs I guess. They did not look too happy. One of them had a shovel and was cutting down every flower when he got to it. They were pretty brooms too. New.

Amos was down at the office and Ricky Clifton took pictures of him in costume as the pope. Left to go down to the Ileana Sonnabend Gallery to the David Hockney opening. He was not showing new stuff just portfolios. Took Amos (cab $2.50). Ran into Gerard Malanga [see Introduction]. Gerard wrote to Fred asking why he would not let him do photography for Interview I guess he just wants a press pass. Fred will not have anything to do with Gerard because we are still getting repercussions from all the fake Electric Chairs we think he did they are being resold and resold and each time the money involved gets bigger so Fred is not about to give Gerard anything. The opening was jammed. did not see David Hockney he must have been in another room. Changed and went over to dinner at the Iranian embassy. Not really the ""embassy"" but you know what I mean-it is where Mr. Hoveyda their ambassador to the you.N. lives (cab $3). China Machado was there and she said she is known Ambassador Hoveyda for ten years or more from when he and her husband were in France hanging around the French filmmakers in the sixties. We talked about how horrible Avedon is she said he gets what he wants out of a person and then drops them. I agreed and then everybody screamed at me that I do the same thing. Pat Kennedy Lawford was there and a du Pont lady who lives next door to the embassy who said it was so nice not to have to go far for a meal and so she was late. She was wearing a black and gold dress with a jewel collar that she said always gets impounded at customs. The food was good but the caviar only came around once."

They always interview the janitors and the old schoolteachers and things. The kid said the devil made him do it. And John was so rich they say he left a $235 million estate. And the ""vigil"" is still going on at the Dakota. It looked so strange I do not know what those people think they are doing."

I think the O'Neal family is probably a really stupid family where the father just happened to make it big in one movie. Because here's this little girl who thinks she is so smart she just thinks she is so intelligent. And when she was a little girl she was advanced but ... A portrait guy came to the office in the afternoon and he was one of those cigar-smoking guys who talks about himself and looks fresh like he is just come out of a gym. About fifty-five. Like what Mike Todd probably looked like. The other day Victor sounded so sick I thought he had the magic disease but yesterday he sounded fine totally recovered. I think Elsa Peretti's dropping lumps of money into his account. He knows when not to go overly too far. I guess he is bored living out in East Hampton. He has a whole house there for $1500 a month. he is being supported in the style to which he is accustomed. Odd people keep telling me how much they love the TV show. Steven Greenberg had a car and we went to the ballet to see ""The Nutcracker."" I would sent flowers to Heather and Jock and Ulrick ... Paige did it for me. The little kids in the audience there were all so rich in just the right clothes with the right hair and eating the right (laughs) chocolates. They looked the way Sandy Brant would dress her kids. Jock and Heather were the leads. Heather's getting tired-looking but she is a really good dancer. The performance was wonderful. Really dancing is only good when the kids are fifteen and you get that skinny frail pinpoint look."

He was calling because we were supposed to go out looking for a new camera. Cabbed to meet him at the camera store on 44th and Madison ($5). Then we walked around Grand Central Station and I got nostalgic-it was like twenty years ago when Grand Central used to be the central point for me when I worked for Vogue and Glamour which are right around there and my bank was right there too.

He did not bring Jean Michel Basquiat's rent payment so later I called Jean Michel Basquiat about his rent being due and then I had a fight with Jay because he gave Jean Michel Basquiat my home phone number. He said ""Oh I did not know you did not want..."" I yelled at him ""Are your brains still with you?"" I mean he knew I would not have Jean Michel Basquiat coming up to my house-I mean he is a drug addict so he is not dependable. You can not have-I mean so then why would I want him to have my home phone? Jay should have known better. And Richard Weisman sent us tickets to the hockey game because Wayne Gretzky invited us. And since I would called Jean Michel Basquiat about the rent I felt bad so I invited him to the hockey game and I sent Jay home early so he could drop off the ticket to him. And Robyn Geddes came by about getting his old job back but Fred had to tell him he could not have it. And Fred called to remind me not to wear bluejeans to the hockey game because we were going to ""21"" afterwards. So then I met the Shiatsu guy who Richard Weisman recommended and he worked on me for an hour and a half and he was really good a thorough professional. He told me that when I cross my legs I should cross them left to right or right to left-I forget which-because one side is weaker than the other but I told him I never cross my legs (laughs). But I am looking now and here I sit talking with them crossed ... anyway so I made a standing appointment for every Wednesday at 7:30. His name is Eizo and his philosophy is: ""You are young you are young you are young therefore you are young."" I lied about my age I told him I was forty-four. And he said ""Oh that is my age too!"" I guess he knew I was lying. But I felt wonderful afterwards."

They were having an Indian jewelry exhibition and gee that stuff is so expensive now. I guess it was Ralph Lauren who drove the prices up to $15-30000 a belt some of them. Brigid was dyeing my surgical corsets for me the ones I wear around my stomach because of when I was shot. She does a beautiful job on them. The colors are so glamorous but it looks like no one will ever see them on me-things are not progressing with Jon. We just work on scripts and that is it. And as I was getting out of the cab I tripped over myself because my bag full of makeup was so heavy and at first I felt like a little kid but then after I thought about it I felt like an old man. And I scraped myself and I was bleeding but nobody saw me except the cabdriver and I pretended it was nothing and skipped home. Jon picked me up and we cabbed ($4) to 1600 Broadway to a screening of Four Friends which is about these kids in the sixties with a lot of plot and subplots and it goes into hippie psychedelic times. It was like all those bad movies that came out in '68 and '69. I thought it was as bad as Honky Tonk Freeway but Jon got really emotional-he was crying all through the movie. So I dropped him off at 10:30. Watched a Chuck Norris kung-fu movie on TV. he is not good-looking but he is really sexy.

Then we went to Calvin Klein's to drop off his wedding present. Went to the office. It was busy there. Lisa Robinson was interviewing Ric Ocasek. Gael came in and said they were doing Charlie Sheen for the February cover. Greg Gorman shot him already and they are doing the second half of the interview today. I have the feeling he will not marry Dolly. Ric did not want to be on our video. And Ann Magnuson is weird she would said she would be our emcee for the show and now she is not even sure she wants to do a little thing on art and fashion. I do not understand her-she does all these free things downtown and then she will not do something when we are trying to help her. And Gael called Sydney Biddle Barrows and asked her would she be a ""Christmas present"" for Steven Greenberg and she was insulted and said how dare you. I mean I would said to Gael ""What makes you think she would do that?"" it is like if somebody was arrested for selling secrets and they got off and then you asked them ""Could you steal a secret for me too?"" I mean what did Gael say to her? ""Since you are a whore anyway ..."" And Gael had been saying ""she will do it for me she will do it for me."" I mean just because Gael had Cris Alexander photograph her in a good light for Interview does not mean she will give a freebie. And I am letting the Caffe Roma use my name as a host for New Year's Eve."

Oh it is the chocolate man. he is trying to deliver chocolates. Hold on ... They were calling it the coldest day of the year but it was not bad in the sun. Went over to Dr. Bernsohn's and he put me in a negative mood. He showed me this crystal and he said ""I paid a thousand for it and it usually costs $5000 but it is worth millions to me there is nothing like it in the world."" And I said okay that maybe I would trade him a print or something and he said ""A print? A print? I was thinking more like two portraits one for my mother and one for me."" He wants $50000 worth of portraits! He said I have to let him know by Friday because Dr. Reese would be ""programmed out"" if I waited longer. I think I am just not going to call him.

I worked until 7:30. Then at home I glued myself together. Bob called and said he was exhausted but he really wanted to go to the Alice Mason dinner so he picked me up and we walked to 72nd Street and Lexington. I was next to Norris Church Mailer. I told her we were still interested in doing something with her for Interview but she said she would put on weight and that she really liked eating better than staying thin for modeling. Then we got a cab to El Morocco Norris and Norman and Bob and me (cab $5). It was a party for Margaux Hemingway's engagement. I ran into Jamie Blandford there and had a fight with him I do not know why I just always do I hope I did not (laughs) offend him. And Mimi Trujillo was there. She was married to the son of that dictator and she is a fashion designer. Victor sees her stuff then tells Halston about it-I mean she does stuff like Halston but she does it sort of first. Millie and Bill Kaiserman were there. I introduced Norris to them but I think I did it in a strange way I guess I said ""This is Norris Church she wants free clothes."" But they should have good-looking people walking around in their clothes for free. There were lots of funny young people El Morocco's back on its way again."

This is for Jean Michel Basquiat's and my things. But I do not get it these are huge paintings he is getting for peanuts. And it is funny because only my Disaster paintings are the ""in"" paintings. Even the Campbell's Soup Cans are ""out."" And I really have only two collectors. Saatchi and Newhouse a little bit. Whereas Roy Lichtenstein and those people have fifteen or twenty. I guess I am just not... a good painter. It got busy at the office. Sean Lennon was coming at 4:00 so I could give him a Christmas present a portrait of himself but I do not know if it will be done in time.

Caroline has turned into a raving beauty-she is thin her face is thin her skin is perfect her eyes are beautiful. We were talking to her and then a cute guy came over Tom Carney. I asked her if it was her boyfriend and she said yes. He writes for Esquire he did the article on Tom McGuane. She asked about her old flame from London Mark Shand. Jean Stein was there with the Russian poet she wanted to introduce to society-some name like Andre Bosh-in-eck-shinsk. she is still writing her book on Edie. Cocktails were from 6:00 to 8:00 and then dinner was being served for the people who did not leave. It was really good food -baked ham and some new potato salad with red lettuce from Cape Cod-she always goes to the best shops. Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton were there and Bob heard-overheard- Jackie saying that something Warren did in the hall was ""disgusting"" but we were never able to find out what it was. We left around 9:00. Got the elevator down with Pete Hamill and the Duchins. Cabbed to Mortimer's for Marisa's dinner ($2). Marisa looked beautiful in silver and Paul Jasmin was with her. she is finally leaving town. she is mad at Barbara Allen because Barbara was seeing her husband Jim Randall out in California so Barbara was not invited. Steve told us that Warren had fucked Jackie O. that he talked about it. Bianca said that Warren had probably just made it up that he made it up that he slept with her Bianca and that when she saw him in the Beverly Wilshire she screamed ""Warren I hear you say you are fucking me. How can you say that when it is not true?"" and she said she embarrassed him. But then Bianca said that Warren had a big cock and Steve said how would she know and she said that all her girlfriends had slept with him. Oh and Diana Ross was at the dinner she was fun. So then after dinner everybody wanted to go to Studio 54. Steve had his Mercedes and Diana Ross was afraid to drive with him but I assured her that he was a great driver which he is even in his drugged states and so she squeezed in between us. Got there and it was jammed-some party for CBS Records. Steve's been having open bar since the bust. James Curley was there with a girl he said he is going to marry so he was cool to me. He was in white tie and tails he would just been to a debutante ball-they are all this week. Oh and Bob was in heaven when we left Jackie O.'s party raving about how nice she would been to him pronouncing his name correctly and sharing her glass of Perrier with him when the butler forgot to bring his-she said ""it is ours."""

They had a couple of security guys at the door. And it was the first time I saw his new house and I was disappointed because I thought it would be on Riverside Drive and when I think of all the great houses they were looking at I do not know why they bought this one. Jed restored it but the house is just a regular house. And just the usual people were there. Ahmet and Camilla and Earl McGrath and Jann Wenner and Peter Wolf and Tom Cashin. I decided to sort of booze it up. They had good food. Maybe it was store-bought but the best store-bought. And Jerry is huge. it is so funny to see these girls pregnant who were so slim. You can not believe it is the same person. it is like a truck. She had a tiara and a white wedding-type dress on.

I am supposed to keep it until Christmas it is really cute. Changed and Jed drove us out to Peter and Sandy Brant's [see Introduction] house in Greenwich. Philip Johnson and David Whitney were there they are leaving tomorrow for San Simeon to see some Hearst and to look at architecture in California. Dinner was Chinese not that great. Bunty Armstrong started using her society teeth. I gave Sandy a 1904 desk set for Christmas. Jed gave her a Fulper pot and she gave him one back. Actually it was a Van Briggle and the one she gave Jed was better. Joe Allen did not bring his girlfriend Jenny because he is still in love with his ex-wife Barbara. Barbara had dislocated her back-""sleeping"" she said and we were trying to figure out with who. A horse fell on top of Peter and so he was walking around with a cane.

Earl McGrath was there and Ahmet Ertegun stopped by for a second. The food was ready at 5:00 but it was supposed to have been ready at 2:00.

We picked up Barbara Allen who was wearing a green taffeta YSL and then we went to the ""hem of Harlem""-that is what Jerry Zipkin calls his neighborhood-and picked up Jerry and he had Nelson Seabra with him. It was a sit-down dinner and the turkey was terrible. It was like canned stuff and the cranberry sauce was canned and there were eighteen different desserts but none of them were good. I was next to ""Suzy"" and Bob was next to Liz Smith and Iris Love and Iris had a kilt on and let me feel if she was wearing underpants. Cornelia looked beautiful. Then I had to get back to Halston's in town and it had suddenly dropped from forty degrees to minus fifteen. Halston gave me a green beaded dress to hang in my closet. it is like a $5000 dress. it is his art. But it is not really my favorite green although it is a nice green. I would rather have had a red one. I felt another cold coming on and I wanted to go home to bed but since the house was empty I did not. I gave Halston a chocolate box of art candy that I made not too great and a Diamond painting and I gave Victor a Shoe one. I got home about 1:30 and opened my packages.

Tama had already left because I guess it was too hard. And Paige was upset because she felt the food was so horrible for the people. But it is just that we are used to such unusually good stuff. It was not worse than high school cafeteria food. And you see people with bad teeth and everything. And we are so used to all these beautiful perfect people. it is such a different world. And the minister was having a bourbon and he was really cute. The church keeps about twenty people overnight and feeds them but I do not know if it is the same ones every night and how they choose them. Passed out Interviews.

We did about two hours of zigzagging and going up the handrail and you just sort of sit on the thing and go up the whole hill and it was really fun. It was easy all two-year-olds skiing with me and if you start when you are two you can really go with the waves and relax and become a good skier but I was so tense. I fell three times.

Then we went to the Olympic Tower for Halston's New Year's Eve party. The people there said that Steve Rubell had just called and said he would be out of jail in two weeks. Halston was still in the same kind of down mood so he had mostly the girls and boys who work for him. He told me he dressed all the girls in tulle to make the place seem like it was full. From the window we could see the ball in Times Square coming down and we could see the fireworks in the park. Marisol was there looking glum.

I do not know why Paige has us doing all this for Tama-""We have to find Tama a boyfriend."" Why? I mean everybody in town needs a boyfriend. The whole world needs a boyfriend. Anyway so Stephen Sprouse was coming. Poor Stephen they are even after him I think and he is scared. Worked till 7:45. The ballet kids came down and I took their pictures. it is so funny that when you look really close you see that Heather Watts actually has a sort of deformed body-and she is the number-one ballerina in New York. And her nose is too big and it may have been fixed from being even bigger but her eyes are really beautiful. they are like gorgeous movie-star eyes the kind with the dark circle around the blue. So Steven Greenberg was giving his New Year's Eve party at the River Cafe in Brooklyn. It was black tie and I was just in my crummy scarf. We left at 11:55 and we rode over the Brooklyn Bridge and that was the most fun part of the night with Paige telling Harold the driver to honk his horn louder and Paige was doing her piercing whistle that comes from her throat and as we came over the bridge the fireworks were going. And then Tama came in the other car and she told us that Steven and Elizabeth Ray had just had a fight and so later I said to Steven ""So have you had a fight with Elizabeth yet?"" and he said (laughs) ""No no not yet not yet."" And then we went to Scott Asen's house in Turtle Bay and there was not much happening there. Peter Martins was using the phone in the toilet and his son was just leaving-he is beautiful he dances. And Sirio from Le Cirque was there and we took him down to Nell's with us and he was fun. Nell took her clothes sort of off and threw herself on the table for a photograph and I told Sirio that he had to do that too if he wanted to make Le Cirque the really ""in"" place. He said his wife and kids were away so he was just on his own this New Year's. He invited us for dinner on Sunday. Paige and Tama went on to the Tunnel we dropped them there and then got home around 4:00 walked the dogs and it threw my whole day off it was so stupid to stay out late just because it was New Year's."

I still think they have the one kitchen in the back of Chinatown with the one big pot that they all dip into. We ate at some dump on Canal Street. We went to a lot of Chinese stores and one Chinese girl recognized me. Then we took the limo to the Spring Street Bar and had drinks ($6) and I realized we should have come there for hamburgers that would have been the better thing. We stopped in at the O K Harris gallery and Ivan had just put a new show up and it was really crowded. Then we went around the corner costume-hunting to a store where a boy who was a camp sold $2000 capes made out of gold thread. Then we went over to Fabulous Fashions. Victor thought it was the most fabulous place I would ever taken him. He bought things for Halston there. And then after Fabulous he dropped me off at the office because I had to meet the Hoveydas there they were bringing a famous Iranian and his wife down and then we were all going down to Ballato's. Mr. and Mrs. Ghaferi. Ballato's was very exciting because John and Yoko Lennon and Peter Boyle and his new I think wife were there. Catherine asked John for his autograph and he said no because he said he just read that Robert Redford does not give autographs so he would not either. And Calvin Klein was there with that girl who gave me my first job at The New York Times-Carrie Donovan. The food was really good and Mr. Ballato was there and I paid the check with a check and then it was so early 10:30 but they dropped us home. Oh and in the middle of dinner I told Catherine how Brigid and Chris Hemphill were both refusing to transcribe any more of the interviews that she does because they said they were so bad and I told Bob he would have to straighten it out. And later he told me he does not know what to do because on the one hand Catherine's interviews are really bad-I mean she asked where the Bronx was in one of her interviews and then even left it in the article because she thought that was ""fascinating""-but on the other hand Brigid and Chris should not be allowed to decide what they will transcribe. And at dinner the Iranians told me that when I paint the Shah to go easy on the eye shadow and lipstick. They said ""Keep it casual but conservative."""

And Ron Jr. still has not made it and it is because he just is not good-looking. If he were he would have a big career by now. And Prince Andrew has gotten so ugly he is looking like his mother. And let us see what else ... Okay went to see Dr. Reese he is in town. He looks a lot younger like he is using Grecian Formula to get rid of his grey hair. So I left there and Paige was having a lunch for condom advertisers and she said that Sam had called her and said that she could not mix her (laughs) dirty condom people in with my Italian guy who was a shoe manufacturer from Italy who wants his portrait done. When I got to the office (cab $6) I told the condom people that I wanted a demonstration (laughs) and then they all took out their rubbers and they showed how the rim of it has adhesive so it would not slide off. So I said (laughs) ""Oh great so you can reuse it three or four times and not take it off!"" Then I made plans to go to dinner with Wilfredo and David LaChapelle the Interview photographer and Sophie Xuerbe's son who I think wants to talk because he read we are doing a movie of Tama's book and he wants to be in a movie.

I really ought to auction off some of my time capsule boxes [see Introduction] that would be a good thing to do in an art gallery. But I would try to make every box a little interesting. I would throw in one of my dresses or an old shirt a pair of underwear-something great in each one. The Negro guys there were rotten to us screaming not to touch things and we left. And Bella Abzug lost to Bill Green. We had to go up to Denise Bouche's for her party for the chairman of the Guggenheim Museum her cousin Peter Lawson-Johnston who is a Guggenheim (drinks $20). Bill Copley was there he was drunk and fun. When he did that play a few months ago he hired a whore to be in it and then he kept her on after the play at $200 a week to live in his house on 89th Street. And now she is taken it over. He once told me he originally furnished his place so that no woman would ever want to live there-that he wanted to make it like a bar-he left his ex-wife in their old apartment on Central Park West. But then the kind of girl he found is the kind of girl who would like to be in a place that looks like a bar-that is where a hooker would feel comfortable so he picked the right girl. He said he is starting to be nervous about her being there though. she is taking over and buying him funny presents and things. But he thinks it is interesting but now he is not so sure about it. I told him I wanted to tape them fighting and I wanted to start this weekend but I have to go to Dallas. They do not fight in public but he will do it for art. Picked up Diana Vreeland and went to Doubles (cab $2). I talked to Norman Mailer and his schoolteacher redheaded new girlfriend from Arkansas.

Meanwhile Suzie was talking to the Fonz. She asked him what he did he said he was ""An Olympic swimmer"" and Suzie was so excited because she would ""never met one before""-she kept asking him what year and if he knew Mark Spitz and everything. By this time the Fonz sort of got annoyed and could not believe anybody did not know who he was. She still did not know who he was after I said ""he is the Fonz."" The Fonz talked very serious he tries to be very heavy. He told me how much he liked me because of ""famous for fifteen minutes"" and something about closets from the Philosophy book-empty spaces and things like that. I was so excited meeting him that I could not think of anything to say. The David Begelmans arrived. We had to leave because the dinner was about to start. There were white orchids on the girls' plates. Allan took us in and showed us the table and the food before he kicked us out. That was funny."

He was in the hospital in Maryland and he used to go to Rupert's in New Hope Pennsylvania for the weekends. And usually he had two people with him but he decided to take a shower and he died in it. He was a guinea pig for a new treatment so they do not know exactly what happened with him. So that was the bad news. The good news was that Edmund got out of the hospital. Peter Wise was going over there to cook. And I wish I could help him somehow but it was good to hear that he got out. Kent Klineman was at the office talking to Fred and me about the Cowboys and Indians portfolio he is commissioning. Went to the Eric Fischl show at the Whitney and it was really interesting.

So he was asking questions that nobody who knew me would ask-like if I was married if I had any kids if my mother was alive...(laughs) I told him ""she is in a home.""[see Introduction] We tried to get Michael to dance and at first he would not but then he and the girl from The Wiz got up and did one dance."

Hoveyda and Zahedi were there Barbara Walters was there with Roone Arledge. I was so excited to meet Roone we talked about Art Buchwald. And Mayor Koch was there with Bess Myerson and she is really tall and handsome and he is about the same height. And Governor Carey walked by and I said hello to him a couple of times but he did not say anything he was with the Ford girl. And Beverly Sills was there she is tall too. This was a thing for ""artists"" and tomorrow the queen is opening an Iranian exhibit at Asia House. Shirley MacLaine said hello to me a few times. And Mollie Parnis was there and Jerzy Kosinski. Then they started the speeches. Zahedi then the-empress the queen. Then Koch then Carey then Kissinger-and he talked for almost forty-five minutes so long-winded. They flew in violets for the ladies and the caviar was called Pearls of the Caspian Sea and Paulette had about a pound. It was white and not too salty. The violinist from Lester Lanin asked for Paulette's autograph. Paulette wanted to leave so we did and she said she would go out of her way to drop me at the door it was so cold. I mean you know it is cold when Paulette gets considerate."

Jean Michel Basquiat called from Hawaii. He said it was not so primitive out there that the first guy he saw said ""are not you Jean Michel Basquiat the New York City graffiti artist?"" And he said he met these hippies out there and mentioned my name and they said ""Oh you mean that death-warmed-over person on drugs?"" And I mean it is him they should be talking about. Jerry came and she had Mick's daughter by Marsha Hunt with her but the girl did not talk she just read a newspaper while Jerry and I worked. Jean Michel Basquiat called again from Hawaii. I told him to cut off his ear. He probably will. Went home and met the shiatsu guy for my weekly massage."

Cabbed up with Jamie and Arnold to a lunch at Elaine's for Arnold's movie Pumping Iron ($5). Stopped at the Ritz Towers had to wait five minutes for Paulette Goddard to come downstairs. She was wearing all her jewelry and was funny. She said ""If you would played your cards right these could have all been yours""-to me. God when I think of how many hours Bob and I spent taping her trying to get the real story of her life out of her for that book Mr. Jovanovich wanted ... I mean if I would been a big Hollywood star and married to Charlie Chaplin and Burgess Meredith and Erich Maria Remarque I think I could have come up with a few hot stories. At Elaine's Delfina Rattazzi was there. She works at Viking now as a reader for Jackie O. Victor was there and Paulette was falling in love with him because she was calculating all the Halstons she could get out of him. Pat Patterson came and sat with us and Charlotte Curtis from The New York Times was there too. Dropped Jamie at the art store ($5). The office was jumping Vincent was going crazy. Bianca called and said she was having a birthday dinner that night for Joel LeBon who works for Pierre Berge. Potassa the drag queen was at the office in a homemade black and gold fantasy dress and Jamie got fascinated and painted her in the dress with her cock showing. he will be painting at 860 for about two months. Then Victor got Potassa to pose in the nude. Nenna Eberstadt is now working for us she was typing up an interview. John and Kimiko Powers came in with a lot of art things for me to sign. Alex Heinrici [see Introduction] came by with some acetates. Worked until 7:00 and then went up to Bill Copley's to sign a painting he would bought. he would just made dinner for his little daughter Theodora. A great dinner-hot dogs ketchup Coke and vanilla ice cream. Dropped Fred off at Lee Radziwill's ($2.75). Went to the party for Joel. Bianca was wearing the same dress she wore the last time-it is strange to see girls who really dress up wearing the same thing twice."

I mean he had Barry Diller in photographs with people he would not want to be in photographs with and Barry's Jon's boss. And Grace Jones came by with her Swedish boyfriend. And I gave her a speech about how she should look more normal or no one would hire her. it is the same speech I gave Debbie Harry after I saw Videodrome that she should just be normal-looking keep her hair red so she could get the Faye Dunaway parts. Then Barbara Allen also came down she is now going with this really rich multi-multi-guy Henrik de Kwiatkowski and everybody's hoping she will this time get married. But Barbara's really changed a lot. she is like one of these older women now. Like the Roxanne Pulitzer one. She still looks good but it is the attitude. I am not putting her down she is really sweet but it is just an attitude change. They go from being a girl to this kind of woman. So this is the guy C.Z. was dating for a little while after her husband died. We went to see Peter Pan (tickets $10). And that was great. Disney still holds up the drawing and the color (food $5). And then on the way out I opened a door and knocked over a little girl. what is wrong with her parents taking her to the movies at 10:00 at night! I felt so horrible-it happened because of those doors that go two ways.
"Wednesday, January 14, 1981","[Gloria Swanson, Joan Crawford, Steve Aronson]",0.31534090909090906,I had Brigid write a thank-you note to Gloria Swanson telling her how much I loved her book and saying that thanks to her I am trying to get off candy. The purpose of the new thing of writing notes is to get notes back-the Joan Crawford thing. Oh and Steve Aronson did one of his good long interviews with Gloria Swanson in Interview and she called the office for his number and invited him over for tea with no sugar. And I was looking at Bob's interview with the Borchgrave guy and Bob does do good political interviews he knows his facts.

Went to the office and Ian McKellen was there for lunch it was Fred's lunch and Sarah Giles from Vanity Fair. And he was so cute he is so sexy his play Wild Honey just closed on Broadway and I really wanted to see it it looked so good in the TV ads. Went to the Dolly Parton party with Sam and Len down to the Gotham (cab $3.50). Dolly was arriving right when we got there and she gave a speech saying that this was a party to celebrate signing with CBS Records after being with RCA for twenty years. She just turned forty and she looks absolutely beautiful but like everything's been done. she is really tiny but her tits are so huge they have to be implants because you just can not get that thin and still have those big tits- I am sure they would have shrunk. Barry Diller came with Calvin and Kelly and David Brenner came. Dolly was sweet. Danny Fields was there and I told him I want to tape his life story and he said he would let me. All the Details people were there and they had the new issue with Stephen Saban's pictures that he took in a photo booth in '65 when we were down at the University of Pennsylvania for my first art show. I guess at the time he was a student and he had me sign one picture and Edie signed another and Gerard signed another. it is a full page and it looked great. Annie Flanders was there and Michael Musto. James St. James was wearing four-inch heels and so was Dolly. And a black guy named Childs was there and he said ""I am Cedar Bar"" meaning he was somebody who used to hang around there and he looked at young Sam sitting there with his snotty attitude and said ""I see these young kids and all I can think is 'Pay your dues.' "" And he was right Sam has a lot to learn and I hope he learns it. I spoiled him taking him to glamorous places when his mind was not ready for it. Now he thinks that is what he deserves and he is fresh to everybody. And then Paige and I walked over to Nell's. It was beautiful weather in the forties or fifties. And Nell's was so glamorous. Fred was there with Ian McKellen and his I guess boyfriend Sean. And against the wall was Claus von Bulow and Cosima and Andrea Reynolds and Nell just goes around taking pictures of people like Fred passed out on the divans. She has a funny picture of Taki whispering in Bob Colacello's ear and Anthony Haden-Guest trying to hear it. And Sting was there he wears Cerutti clothes now and Nell asked him how his career and all started and he said this and that happened and then he said ""And then Andy made me a star."" Maybe we were the first to put him alone on a magazine cover. He said he wants to do plays now. I do not know why Sting would ever do that Frankenstein movie The Bride. If it had been a singing Frankenstein that would have been something. And then Nell left her chair and then Bob Dylan came over and sat down and he said he would just seen my photography show at the Miller Gallery-that he would literally just come from there. And then Nell came back and pretended she did not know who he was and said that that was her seat. I want Nell to take pictures for Interview but she only takes color pictures so I left her some of my black and white film. I introduced von Bulow to Nell and then to Dylan. I lost my scarf and I was glad because I hated it. But then I found it. That cashmere scarf I ordered from Brigid's friend who knitted it on a machine and it was supposed to be like the red Halston one I would lost but the Halston one was somehow so light and this one is so heavy. Paige dropped me off at 2:00. And poor Bess Myerson's on suspension. she is really in trouble because they say she sort of bribed a judge to reduce her married boyfriend's alimony payments. I can not believe all these men fighting over this sixty-year-old lady."

I said he would never called anybody that before and he said her body was so hot that he would come five times in a night. This is a black girl he met who works at Comme des Garcons. Worked till 8:00."

There were a lot of English people there who'd been living and working in Kuwait for years. Left. Big rainstorm. Picked up by Nadja and had a fight with Fred about not going to Germany. He said I had to go because ""you are a fading star there."" It was the way he said it that got me mad. Dinner at Nadja's house. There were sixty people. The best party the whole trip. She had eight or ten brothers and a mother and sisters and all the men dance together looks like the twist. The food was really good. Then men began dancing with Fred. Someone gave him $40 for dancing so well. Had to stay until everybody left-2:30. James admired somebody's robe and they gave it to him. Jed admired someone's nose ring and he got it. I did not know about the custom so I did not get anything."

This is for the Whitney poster. Ronnie was out sick. Gigi told me that she is pregnant and that if Ronnie wants the baby she will stay in New York and they will have it but if he does not she will get a divorce and leave. Whitney Tower called and said that Kenneth Anger threw paint at Fred's door up on 89th and Lex again.

And it does look like a Mondrian. they have got valuable Miro paintings in the lobby and art all over. it is on Sunset near La Cienega. it is not Beverly Hills. You know what is fascinating is that Hollywood's still filled with all these delicate ladies who look like they were beauties all glued up and in their cars driving around. Not with drivers just driving themselves. And you wonder what they used to do what star they were what roles they had. Everybody reminds me of Jane Wyatt out there. Those skinny petite beauties who wear turbans and they are at premieres and things. And they are like eighty years old. How do these ladies live? I mean if they were contract players they did not make much. I guess one of their husbands must have been rich. But was not that before community settlements? But I guess you do not need much to live. Like you do not pay rent if you have your own house. And food well you can eat at McDonald's or there is always some fairy fan who will take you around. We went out driving took a lot of pictures on Melrose. Went to the Interview office out there talked to Gael and I was really upset when she told me that Peter Lester had died in Los Angeles. that is two Interview editors dead of AIDS.

If we would been sneaking in marijuana or drugs it would have been so easy. She was so friendly but later we began hearing wild stories about how her husband was keeping lolas in a sanitarium. Found lolas in the VIP room. He was like a little old lady wrapped up in fabric. We found out later he would come out of the hospital just to pick us up. Then the whole story began unraveling. lolas was just presenting me at the bank Credito-Valtellinese. ""Alexander lolas Presents Andy Warhol."" He must have gotten all this money to ""present"" us. My Last Supper show was closing down that day and my other show was opening so there was lots of publicity. lolas was really sweet. He had to be driven back to the hospital. Lisa took us to the hotel. Our rooms were beautiful. The Principe di Savoy. Christopher took the best room with the TV. Fred was down the hall (bag man $10 magazines $25 waiter $5).

We liked his boots so he asked us our sizes and called this place in Georgia to send three pairs up. he is been living in a suite at the Westbury for months waiting to have skin grafts on the hand he burned in his plane crash. I think Catherine has a crush on him. Worked on some paintings in the back. I am really tired though I am not getting enough sleep. Bianca stopped by and five minutes later Mark Shand did. And Brigid told me ""All day long Lady Isabella Lambton picks her nose and eats it and if you say something to her about it she just laughs and goes right on doing it. She told me that at night she and her boyfriend pick each other's noses. it is hard to take."" Went up to the Olympic Tower to see Halston's new offices (cab $3). it is on two floors and it looks out on St. Patrick's steeple. We had some drinks.

Patrice Munsel was singing at the piano with a vice-president from Benton & Bowles. She wore an outrageous hat and I have never seen anything like it-like two big Mickey Mouse ears. Mary McFadden was there with a boyfriend a German boy who was just so good-looking. The big star of the evening was Polly Bergen she lives in New York again and we did the running routine about Barry Landau of ""how is your friend?"" ""I thought he was your friend."" ""he is not my friend I thought he was your friend."" Barry's been calling the office but they tell him automatically that I am out. And Joanne Winship has that tough society voice that just drives you up the wall! She talks nonstop and it makes you crazy. And Mr. Winship works for Associated Press.

Jean Michel Basquiat invited me to dinner with his father at Odeon (cab $6). And the father was this thin normal-looking man in a business suit smart and so you can see where Jean Michel Basquiat gets his smartness. And now Jean Michel Basquiat does not even like his girlfriend from Comme des Garcons Charlotte because she borrowed money from him. He likes to give people money but then he resents them for taking it. he will say ""they are using me."" it is a funny attitude. And in a moment of passion once he told her he loved her and she told him that she was a ""free woman"" so he tied her up and told her how dare she think that he meant it."

He said that once Liza and Bianca were both at his house they were in the bathroom peeing together-you know how girls like to do that have people to talk to while they are in the bathroom-and Bianca said that she had bigger muscles than Liza and so they dropped their tops and were comparing muscles in the mirror and Halston walked in on them. And while Halston was telling me this Bianca came in from exercise class and Halston had her show her muscles so she dropped her top and showed them and she really does have a good body on top. Then she made another Puerto Rican dinner. And then Dr. Giller came in and he would slept a few hours after being up all night dancing so he was refreshed and he started trying to find Halston's energy center and while he did that Halston was having white powder so finally when Dr. Giller announced that he would found Halston's energy center Halston had had enough white powder so that he did have energy.

Peter called and said it was Chris's birthday and was I going to take them out to celebrate. I could not face it so I started a fight about that to get out of having to do it. Then I took Benjamin as my date to a party at Louise Melhado's. Jennifer had come to work for five minutes but it was just long enough to give us the wrong address. But we eventually found it. We were both dirty and in our bluejeans and it was hard explaining why Benjamin was there. But it was an old crowd so the old boys wanted to meet him. Decorators. Dropped Benjamin (cab $20). I went home and watched Dynasty. Helmut Berger was good. Then went to bed early. But then I remembered the caviar in the kitchen that Calvin had sent so I started down the stairs-I was in my socks-and it was like a comedy I slipped and fell three times. Just flopped down the stairs. And I got bruised. Macy's and Zabar's were having a caviar war this Christmas but Calvin got his at William Poll so he probably paid a lot for it. Woke up in the middle of the night thinking of the expose of my life that I hear Women's Wear Daily is doing. Oh and David Whitney called and said yesterday that Leo Lerman had been fired from Vanity Fair and the girl in England who does the Tatler was going to be editor.

Fred told me I could not say anything to Heiner about loaning us money for the building. But Heiner's having another party next week and then I will. Because he is taking John Chamberlain's loft and making a museum for him there and I think why does not he rent the Madison Avenue part of our new building and have the museum for me there? I would ask him but people only want to do things if they think of it themselves so I will just hint and hint. I did suggest that he open a bar in the building and he said no no that Moslems do not drink-he and Philippa are Moslems now that they are Whirling Dervishes.

And the thing is this woman's actually nice-looking it is just one of those people who photographs all the wrong way-all the bumps are in the wrong places. Like the bump of her nose just goes the complete wrong way in pictures and it is actually a perfect nose in life. But now they loved them they took three.

Mark Ginsburg had called and said the interview with Irene Worth was on for that night and I said I would meet him at the Vivian Beaumont where her play The Cherry Orchard was. We were going to see it first. Irene's voice was good and that is all that really matters-everything she says sounds like real acting. The lights went down and I thought it was the end of the act but it was not. It was the Blackout of '77. They kept acting on stage in the dark and the girl who played the daughter announced ""is not this fun? let us keep going!"" A guy came on stage and said that anybody who wanted to leave would be shown the way out and that they would just keep going with the play they had guys on stage holding candles. So everybody was a real trouper and this was the moment these actors had been waiting all their lives for-to make the show go on. Then after the play as Mark and I were walking backstage to see Irene a man said ""This is the most thrilling thing that is happened to me passing Andy Warhol in the dark."" Irene changed and put on bluejeans and turned out to look young. She served champagne. I had enough tape for three or four hours' taping. A Lincoln Center guy was saying ""Stay in the crowds they are mugging people all over"" (cab $4 big tip). For some reason it was so simple to get a cab we just walked out and got in one and went with a friend of Irene's who I also know Rudy to his apartment on 67th and Lexington right on the second floor. He had candles all over because he always eats with candles. He made omelettes on his gas range it was all so easy. They were delicious. Did the interview with Irene. The phones were sort of working-you had to wait for a dial tone but then it was okay."

Got up early. Paige was having a lunch for two gay guys from Diener Hauser Bates. One had had my old friend George Clobber for a teacher at Pratt so we talked about that. George Clobber was the first person who told me about the gay life. Went to meet Maura at 6:45 (cab $7) at the Russian Tea Room. And then we went over to the Ziegfeld and there were the crowds lined up. And now there is a new thing-for Good Morning America when they photograph you they say ""Are you aware that you are being photographed for Good Morning America? And do you give your consent?' "" I said ""I do."" And then eighteen bodyguards came in and Stallone and his wife arrived and I was on the aisle and he saw me and stopped and said he was glad I would come. Then the lights went down and Frank Mancuso gave a speech. And then Sasha Stallone gave an emotional speech about their autistic child that the benefit was for and all I could think of was Bad because we were the first to have an autistic kid in a movie. I loved Staying Alive. Then the party at Xenon was at 11:45 so we went over there and on the way we ran into Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon. I would never met him and I had copies of Interviews with me the new one and he said ""Oh I already bought that one."" And she does not have any wrinkles and she is like 110 years old or something. Then coming out of Xenon were eighteen bodyguards and in the middle was John Travolta in his tuxedo and I caught his eye and he came over and said hello. So that was two in one night."

He said I would better not open my mouth. And I guess I better not kill myself either. I would gotten Mary Richardson an appointment to see Halston about a job because she would asked me to but then she said she would had lunch with Bill Blass in the meantime and he was going to pay her $500 an hour to model and so she was thrilled about that and was not even going to see Halston. After I would gone to all the trouble of getting her the appointment. Mary decided to give a small dinner at Fred's which turned out to be a big dinner and she invited me and Fred got mad because he said he would have to fix the house up so I would not be upset when I saw it-he is got all these English kids staying there it is like a rooming house. At Fred's Steve Aronson was there with Shelley Wanger and her new boyfriend David Mortimer who is so good-looking. Then Steve-oh God he knows everything and he remembers just what you do not want him to. He looked at Jon and said to me ""What did you say his name was? what is that name? is not he the one you told me thought that Popistn was badly edited?"" And I said ""Ohhh please Steve not now."" And the thing I can not understand is why I would have told Steve that and even said Jon's name to him. that is fascinating. Why would I do that? Why would I beg for trouble? And when Steve heard that Fran was going to be on the cover of Interview he said that he wanted to be on the cover too when his book Hype came out. So then he was going on about how he had checked into Jon-into exactly what his job was at Paramount-and how he was a ""vice-president in charge of inter-office memos"" and finally I told him that if he did not shut up I would not put him on the cover. So then he said he just interviewed Roy Cohn and that he was going to ask him ""are not you a big fag?"" but then he ended up liking him and he did not so he still had the leftover question and he asked me if I'dlike to admit that I was."

And then I did a radio program and then I ran upstairs and found that Jed had gotten the copy of L'Uomo Vogue with me on the cover which makes me look so awful and there were a lot of good-looking people inside wearing bluejeans. We divided up in cars and went out to have lunch with Helene Rochas and Juliette Greco's sister Charlotte and her architect husband. Everybody went swimming and we had bullshots and they were so great and then we had lunch the best fish I ever had the best food it was just so glamorous breaded fish with anise and then we had anise down by the swimming pool and we dished everybody. And then we left around 5:00 and Rocksavage dropped us off. There was a birthday dinner for Lynn Wyatt but I have not bought her anything yet. Johnny Carson was going to be there and I could not wait to meet him. We ran into Maxime Mesinger in the lobby she is that wonderful gossip reporter from Houston she came here just for Lynn's birthday party. Got dressed cabbed to Lynn's in Cap Ferrat ($35). We thought we would be early but we were not. We got there and Estee Lauder was there and Lynn took me around to introduce me to people. And the first person she introduced me to was Johnny Carson. That was really exciting. he is not short. he is tall. He has grey hair and he looks so healthy. I took lots of pictures of him. And his wife Joanna is beautiful she used to be a model with Norell so we dished the dresses and fashion and junk like that and I did not take any pictures I was just too-I thought it would be too much. Everybody was too scared to sit at the Johnny Carson table but David Niven sat with him and we sat with Liz Smith who was sitting at the last table by the swimming pool. And then the king or prince of Yugoslavia said he had a Mao painting of mine. Everybody sang ""Happy Birthday"" to Lynn and then they had great fireworks all the way around. A lot of sparkles and pink smoke and really loud firecrackers. there is so much in the papers about Ronald Reagan and it looks like he is on his way to become president it does look scary. I voted once. In the fifties I do not remember which election. I pulled the wrong lever because I was confused I could not figure out how to work the thing. There was no practice model outside it was a church on 35th Street between Park and Lex. This was when I was living at 242 Lexington. And then I got called for jury duty and I wrote back: ""Moved."" I have never voted again."

And they were showing the TV show that this MTV kid had gotten together in five hours and it was great. It was everybody saying things putting down John like a roast. And Steve Rubell was there he bought the Diamond Horseshoe that used to belong to Billy Rose. Which is I guess in the West 40s near Eighth Avenue. I took Dolly Fox to this and got gossip out of her. she is still living with Charlie Sheen he gave her some pearls which were beautiful-I think they are dyed black though but they are beautiful-and he gave her a diamond ring. Oh and yesterday Gael told me to check into whether Ron and Doria Reagan were breaking up. I told her that if she had a scoop she should call People magazine and make $150. (laughs) Brigid was just on the other line and she said that her mother does not have much more time. She does not seem sad at all just like she was not really when her father died. She seems sort of thrilled.(laughs) I do not know why I say that but I do. she is going to be getting millions. How do these doctors really feel about sick people? Do they care about you and really want you to get better or is it just a business? I mean I think about doing portraits and do I really care if they look good or is it just a job? And that is just a superficial thing-it is not life and death. In the morning I would gotten Stuart to go to the crystal doctor with me. He said how could I be going to these people when I am supposed to be smart. So we went to Bernsohn's and there was a visiting doctor there American but he lives in Japan. And he has a new crystal that is for rolfing a big round one. It does what rolfing does when they knead every muscle but without doing that. And the doctor tried it on me and told me to think of white light and white arrows and Bernsohn and the doctor were in a circle holding their hands up around me and Stuart's eyes were just rolling up he could not believe it. I always wear two crystals-a ' vitalizer"" and another one. They look like diaphragms. Dr. Reese's son manufactures the crystals. they are called Harmonics."

But I invited him to 860 not the new building so he would not see it was grand in case he was wanting to buy it. I will try to sell him art instead. But you know how these things always turn out-he will probably say he wanted to ask me what kind of ink Interview uses! He owns Vogue and Vanity Fair and 1000 newspapers but he will be asking me where do we buy our pencils or something. The Democratic Convention is too boring. I sat next to Jesse Jackson at a Time magazine dinner and he was too serious. He was ""above"" all of us."

Richard Weisman came too in a limo that parked downstairs. Tom Seaver was adorable. Athletes really do have the fat in the right places and they are young in the right places. The person taking the photographs was Mr. Johnson a nice man who did the story on Jamie Wyeth and me once. He wanted Tom to wear a Mets hat so they went out and bought one and then he wanted Tom to do a Cincinnati-uniform with-a-Mets-hat picture half and half but he refused. Tom's wife Nancy was calling on the phone. He hates the Mets now. he would just bought a new house in Connecticut and everything when they traded him. I have not been feeling well for the past two weeks I think it is the pimple medicine. I am going to the pimple doctor again early in the morning.

Ala von Auersperg is her daughter from her first husband and she and her brother are accusing him. he is about fifty-five I think. He told anecdotes. At 4:00 the Walt Disney film crew came and shot me in front of my Shoes and my Walt Disney drawings.

I never did really know what was wrong. Our phone lights were broken so I picked up a line by mistake and Brigid was talking to her mother on it and it was so sad. I just had to listen. Her mother was talking about pulling her wig off her head and the bumps on her head. Here she took care of this man all her life and the second he dies she gets cancer. She never had a chance to then go out and have fun. Then Rupert drove us over to 14th and Eighth where the Odeon guy Keith McNally is opening Nell's with Nell Campbell from The Rocky Horror Picture Show as the hostess. And he wanted our opinions on the food and if he should charge $15 or $5 to get in. it is a disco downstairs and upstairs quiet and no noise. I said the downtown people would resent the charge and that it would just turn into a disco not anything higher it would not be a private club or anything. The downstairs looked like a real firetrap.

Victor was putting the jewelry in his mouth and in his ass and I was photographing it. He lay down on the floor and when he saw an electric surveillance eye looking down at him he asked what ""that ruby up in the sky"" was. Halston asked for a discount and when they only offered him 5 percent he was shocked. They probably had the place bugged and listened to everything we said when they were out of the room."

I kept asking her how much the building cost and she said oh well she just could not remember you know so offhand and I mean this is a person who would know to the penny in one second how much she paid for every floorboard. And it was a glamorous reception room and I was jealous of the setup so neat and orderly and she is been printing Norman Rockwell for years. Then Fred said may we have our check please and they did not even have it. And then the 5' X 5' lady had an extra print there and she said ""Oh it would be so sweet of you to sign it to me"" and I just said no. And then later I took it all out on Fred. I mean she was so grand the fat slob and they did not even have our check. But I am sure they do make up a lot of extras these things are always showing up in Macy's or somewhere. Prints are so easy to fake. And I mean museum posters? Forget it! Anybody can do a poster from this or that show at this or that museum. I mean I see my Brooklyn Bridge print being sold everywhere and where is our part of that money? And Fred since he stopped drinking his grandness is appearing again and it is kind of scary. It only used to appear when he was drinking and now it is there without drinking. he is going to Linda Li. And he does not know if she really believes this stuff or if she is just out to make a hundred bucks. I guess she jangled up his nerves. He said he just wanted to see what I was into now."

He said that the Guests are taking him to Minnesota to a hospital there to dry out some more. He said he got about 100 letters about his Stanley Siegel Show and he read me the one from Stanley Siegel which was so disgusting saying how great Truman had been and you just know if he really cared he would not have let him go on and this one show really put Stanley Siegel on the map it got him national attention.

And Gordon Liddy talked about ""takeovers."" Like if you are walking down the street and someone thinks they are stronger than you they take you over. And he pulled a knife out of his waist and I could not believe it. I was surprised that he is so small. he is about my size and in a way he is like Mr. Milquetoast. And he pulled out these pictures of his three sons from a leather envelope. And here's the big bruisers in swimsuits and you can see the outlines of their dicks. These were like 8"" X 10"" color photographs-artistic with ripples in the water! I mean this is a very strange way to take pictures of your kids to carry around! And he was thrilled because one of the kids was going to be a Marine. they are all at Fordham. And he said his girls did not want him to carry their pictures but I am sure he did not care about the girls he was just thrilled with the big bruisers. And one of the boys had a two-inch cat a little kitten that he was holding. And he also had pictures of his house on the Potomac. And Tim was there with his hippie talk and Gordon Liddy would spout facts about how many A-bombs have been exploded. And he is sort of lost Liddy it is odd. it is like he does not know what to do with himself. He liked me a lot he wants us to see more of each other. Tim left and he stayed on for a while."

I wanted a giant-size aluminum set they said it was antique. They recognized me because Jay had an Andy Warhols TV T-shirt on (teeth $484). Carried the big teeth in the rain. That was fun. Calvin Klein invited me out to Fire Island for the weekend and I talked to Steve Rubell and he said that Bianca had called and asked if I was going to be there because she was invited too.

He said to me ""I have so many ideas I have just got so many I will tell you three plays right now"" and then he told me the first one. He said [imitates]: ""it is called The Greek Ideal and it is about a young man and his mother and he is a Greek scholar and he is going to Harvard and he is maybe a little crippled. His mother gives him a present before he goes away she takes him to a Greek island and it is just the son the mother and a maid""-I guess there was a maid-""and they are sitting on the island and suddenly the mmmoooooon rises and out of the moon come hundreds of little rats and they eat him. And the mother is in a black hood."" Well (laughs) I did not know what to say I said ""Oh that is great Truman but does it have to be rats? I mean there was Ben and Willard and everything...."" And then Bob said to me ""do not you know that is from Truman's old short story 'Walk Around the Block' which he did years ago and everybody's copied it?"" And then Truman told the second play which was not as bad [imitates]: ""A young man of sixteen down South marries a girl of thirteen for her money and he is precocious and paranoid...."" I did not really get that one. And when he got to the third play he said (laughs) ""It will be improvised and we can do ANYTHING! it will be called Deep Holes."" So then I said ""But gee Truman can not I just tape you the real thing and do plays about real people? can not I go to your gym with you?"" So we have a date for Friday at 11:00. Then after lunch we went over to his apartment and there were two copies of The New York Times magazine article on him that is going to be out this week an advance copy. And the picture with it did not look like Truman it looked just like his mother. He was in a straw hat and a bedsheet that made him look pregnant standing in the grass. And the article says just exactly what he did in his life that he only likes men who have a wife and lots of kids because they were the family that Truman never had that he likes to become close to the kids. And it described Truman's boyfriend John O'Shea the one that Bob and I met in Monte Carlo a few years ago. It was funny it was not even talking about Bob MacBride and there he was fitting the description reading about it. Truman said ""No not six kids just four or so is plenty."" Then Truman read the article and Bob took me into the bedroom to show me more of his artwork. And Truman read for about an hour. Then Bob said he needed a nap then Truman said he had to leave so I asked him if he were going to his psychiatrist and he said no to the gym. His gym is right where the old Factory used to be 47th and Second. On the way out in the lobby of his building he held up the picture of himself in the article for the elevator people. He said ""Look it is me. How d'ya like it?"" And he was talking about the article it said the word ""decline"" and he said ""Decline? What decline? I am the most written-about writer in the world."" I guess he is confusing written-about with writing."

And it was not until afterwards that Benjamin said to me ""But did you see that Chris had his steak wrapped up to go?"" And I had not. But he was depressed so I would have had to let him get away with it anyway. He was so melancholy he had tears in his eyes. He put on his sunglasses. He was carrying his bags under his eyes.

"Wednesday, June 10, 1981",[Lynn Revson],0.051695526695526677,Archie's really acting sick and I do not know if it is because he is worried about me because I am home or if he is sick because he wishes I would get out of the house. Well my philosophy is Life is not worth living if you are not healthy and health is wealth-it is better than money and companionship and love and everything else. I have not said that Lynn Revson called and said she loved the portrait but that her cheekbones looked too fat. I knew she would be trouble. Got a call from Paramount Pictures again. he is coming to New York on Friday just when I am leaving.

The traffic was so bad and now I know why commuters get heart attacks from stress not that I was rushing to get there but if I had been it would have been awful. We got there at the end. Edmund's father looked like a Southern preacher a movie character. He was peculiar. Then Paige and I walked to the Plaza for the Yoko Ono thing and she had her shoes off and I told her she was crazy. I had her turn her Interview T-shirt around because it was black tie (cab $4). Yoko and Sean were there. Nona Hendryx was too and Roberta Flack got there an hour late. Cab Calloway got a medal. It was a benefit to get Harlem kids adopted. And when you see these kids you do really want to adopt one. they are so cute. I will give money to anyone who will raise one of these kids. Spread the word. Then went to Hunter College where there was a party for the Rodney Dangerfield movie Back to School. Got there and saw Sam and PH in the thick of it and my God what groupies. They were packed in around him with cameras and PH asked him to take a picture with me and he was really nice he said ""Andy I got to give it to anybody who is hung in there as long as you."" Paige walked me home and everybody else went down to the Harley-Davidson Biker Night at Area."

I told him he should get some rest really go to bed and stay there for a while. Curley called up and invited me to his birthday party. I called Henry Geldzahler to invite him because he said he wanted to go. I could not get Curley back because his father'd given him a box to answer calls. Vincent called Doug Christmas and he is so awful. They swear up and down that the check was sent and give you the bank number and everything and when you call back they are ""out to lunch."" The girls at his gallery there must feel horrible having to say things like that. If he would just say ""I can not pay you"" you would know where you stood. And Philip Niarchos is still going with Manuela Papatakis who I never liked at first but she is really sweet and classy-one of those short girls who make themselves look tall. You know they wear those high shoes and I just do not understand how they walk in them you are always on your toes. I have put some on and that is how I do not understand it. Bob Weiner called and accused us of having an anti-Semitic newspaper because of some line in Truman's interview about stuffing all Jews and putting them in the Museum of Natural History. He said he would read it to five people and they all agreed."

And I told him it was true. But later when I got home Peter had sent an orchid plant so I felt bad. Our old office architect Peter Marino was featured in The New York Times this week for doing Marella Agnelli's apartment. So I guess he is rolling in bucks now. And Richard Gere is finally calling back he says now he may do our cover. He must feel he has a flop movie coming out.

But Lorna was not even there. Her husband Jake Hooker was and he said that Lorna's seen it too much. Sat in the back row and this third time it was better than when I sat up close in the screening room.

He should be staying in town seeing to business. But for some reason he thinks he is part of the London scene. For some reason he identifies with all those English kids who sponge off him. And we never get work from England from any of them. I do not know. And Tom Sullivan died. At twenty-four. His heart failed. John Reinhold invited us over for drinks to see his Michael Graves apartment. So we went over there and it used to be big rooms and Michael Graves turned it into a railroad flat. Really if you have ever seen a cold-water flat that is what this looked like. Eighteen million columns and doors that open and things that swing out and a million details and so many different colors it was ridiculous. I mean it will probably photograph well they can make it look really big but he took these great Robert Stern rooms and made three rooms and eight closets out of it. I mean it is really detailed and you can not believe how detailed but it just-I do not know what it is supposed to mean. I got tired. Went home at 11:30 had some codeine cough medicine and went to bed.
"Wednesday, June 19, 1985",[],0.09169312169312169,In the morning Amos still was not feeling well. I would given him part of a Valium when he was yelping the day before and I thought he would be fine. When I called to ask Jed to take him to the vet he was not in town so I took him myself (cab $3). Dr. Marder was not there so we saw Dr. Greene then dropped Amos back home. Then went up to Bernsohn's and that was interesting. I told him that the crystal I would put in the kitchen at the office to repel roaches was not working that we were getting more roaches than ever. He said he was going to call Dr. Reese about it and later in the afternoon he called and said that the crystal was now reprogrammed to un-reverse itself so now we will see the proof. But anyway while I was still there the most interesting thing was that he told his secretary Judy to get up on the table and pretend to be Amos and he asked her what was wrong with her and she said that she had a crushed vertebra on her left or right side. And I had not told him! And she told him that farther down she also had maybe an ulcer. And then Judy said she did not want to be a dog anymore that she wanted to go back to human so she did. He said to give Amos comfrey for the ulcer. There was a big lunch at the office. The Mosses were coming from A&M records-the wife I did the portrait of. Their son is going to acting camp.

Room service did not answer. Cabbed to the ICA press conference ($4). Huge crowd the show looked really terrible. Did twenty interviews and some pictures. Then we went to Marguerite Littman's for lunch to meet Rock Hudson but his plane was delayed and I had to leave to do more interviews. Marguerite invented something great for dessert-chocolate soup! it is orange juice and Grand Marnier and chocolate hot. Back to hotel (cab $4). The ICA opening. Lots of punks. Ann Lambton and I went to sit where the punk band was in the cafeteria and we had fun. Then Fred was arranging a small party back at the Dorchester in one of the restaurants there but it turned into forty-five people. Rock Hudson came in with his big butch sixty-year-old boyfriend. it is so funny when they have boyfriends older than they are. Thomas Ammann took a picture of Rock and Rock did not like it but Fred said Rock was a bore anyway. Jack Nicholson came he is in London doing The Shining and I guess we forgot to invite Shelley Duvall. The kids were smoking joints and went out to the clubs-the Embassy Club Tramps Annabel's. But I was too tired.

We went to City Center for the Martha Graham thing. After the performance Bianca lost Tricky Dicky Cavett and had to find him and then we went over to Halston's. And Dick was telling me about this transsexual in New Orleans that was after him and asking me what he should do and I just kept saying he should fuck her and I do not know what he wanted to hear. And Dick was doing anagrams for a whole hour. And I went completely off my diet I had potato chips and drank and I felt like Brigid. Left with Dick and Jane and Dick was pawing Jane in the car and I asked him where his missus was. Was dropped by Dick at 2:00.

Right? I was giving an interview to the Miami Star. Chris Makos called from his darkroom. I want to go around town with him taking pictures. Nobody's done 42nd Street and the Statue of Liberty in a while. Then when we were leaving the office and we would locked the elevator and we were getting ready to leave as I was walking by the middle room the creepy kid who'd come up earlier jumped out from behind a crate. I mean that is why I always tell Vincent to check around because people can really hide behind things. And later Adam Robinson from Oxford who'd stopped by and who was still with us said that he would seen the box move but had not told me. So this kid was hiding behind the box while I was giving the interview to the Miami paper. He said it was ""Performance Art."" I mean I could tell he was a creep from the beginning. Somehow Vincent got him out but I was really rattled. We left and I dropped Rupert at 7:30 ($5). When we were crossing the street to get the cab Rupert and me a cab stopped and it was Hiram Keller waving and I had to go kiss him in the cab and he looked absolutely beautiful like the day we met him gorgeous and full of life and I just can not believe he never became a big star after Satyricon. Is it because there is so many beauties now? A kid I know from Studio 54 called me up and at first I was not going to take the call but he said he would had a breakdown in California and that I was the only one he was calling so I did. he is going back out to California. When I got home I was still tense from the intruder so I had a brandy. And that led to the candy drawer and that led to the TV all night. I watched the Mother and Daughter Beauty Pageant on TV. And a rerun of Farrah Fawcett. Bob Wilson's play got terrible reviews. And I was watching a rerun of Carol Burnett and those people were just so good so talented so funny. I mean Bob Wilson has an autistic kid and does a few imaginative things but that is all. I mean it is like when you see Carol Burnett you think how nothing a thing like Bob Wilson's is."

And David was cool to me. I mean here's this man who wants to marry me when Philip Johnson kicks the bucket and he did not even invite me to the dinner. He was wearing the Stephen Sprouse tie I gave him. And Tom Armstrong does not invite me to anything anymore because he does not have to court me now that the Whitney's got all my old films (phone $4 cab $5.50).

After being the biggest thing in America last year he is just on real early in the morning. I was picked up by Ian Schrager and went out to Roy Cohn's annual party in Greenwich and traffic was bad because of the bridge that had collapsed and now they say that it was a seven-inch pin that caused the whole thing to go. it is so abstract. People just kept driving onto it even when it was not there-until a big tractor-trailer blocked it off. I talked to Bob Colacello. he is going to Europe to do an article for Parade. Sat in a corner by the pond. Ate a fast dinner. Saw Calvin and told him that Juan Hamilton was very upset that Calvin had not taken his call. I guess Juan and Georgia O'Keeffe feel that they treated Calvin so well when he was out there in New Mexico with them that he should be very friendly and do favors but then I guess Calvin feels that he spent so much money buying Georgia's paintings that he does not have to do anything more.

Gary Lajeski is having a show of my prints or something out there which I do not even know anything about in a couple of weeks and Fred thinks I should go because he says then you are in people's minds and they will buy later. Decided not to go to Lena Home's goodbye party. Decided to go to Roy Cohn's third annual birthday party in his house in Greenwich. Steve Rubell was not driving his car because he is been drinking too much so Ian drove and it was me and Steve and Ian and Bob. And Bob is so sour he does not talk to me anymore. I did not wear a tie. I was wearing an Interview T-shirt and he got mad at that. I do not know what is his problem. Roy's house is right near the center of Greenwich. it is a really little house. And when you go to these Roy Cohn things all everybody says is ""it is so amusing it is so interesting because you never know who you will find at these things."" They say you get everyone from the Mafia to the shoe repairman. Which is true because this guy came over to me and said ""I am the garage mechanic who worked on your car for years. I have always wanted to meet you."" C.Z. Guest was there she would put in the roses at Roy's house and Cornelia was with her. And I did something dumb. I guess wine is affecting me quicker now. The guy Combemale whose wife is Freddy Woolworth's sister was telling me a joke and he tore a dollar bill in half. So I took out a hundred dollar bill and tore it in half and gave half to Mrs. Bassirio and half to Doris Lilly and told them that they would have to be friends forever because they each had the other half. The food was really good but the people were acting like such animals to get it. Everybody says Roy has seven boyfriends one for each day of the week. And he must have gone to a butcher to have a facelift because you could see the bloody scars from his latest one they really were showing."

And creamed spinach and then this great dessert which was fruit ice cream piled onto a big meringue. And the dinner was for Diane Von Furstenberg and Barry Diller. There were all these crazy people from Dallas and Fort Worth. They were really rich with big rocks and they were really vulgar and funny. Divorced and out for kicks. And then after dinner we went into the living room and everyone loved Lynn's portrait. Diane said she loved it so much that she wanted me to do her kids' portraits but I know she does not mean it. And then John Travolta arrived with thirty people. He was going to come to dinner but he wanted to bring thirty people so Lynn had said no. And he is so good-looking. He had on a black silk shirt and a bright green linen jacket and black pants and his eyes are so blue. He was with this cute little girl and a lot of bodyguards and with Jim Bridges who directed Urban Cowboy. And then there was Debra Winger who is the female star of the movie and she is great we want to do something with her. She told me about high colonics and that she is full of shit. Her family was there and her boyfriend. He was cute Jewish. And Barbara Allen and Jerry Hall were making fun of ladies with jewels right in front of their faces. And Maxime Mesinger the gossip columnist came with John Travolta too and she gave him a dinner first. Then we got a ride with Barry and Diane. Barry got mad because Jerry and her sister Cyndy and Fred were so drunk they would not let him out of the car at his hotel and he was not in that good a mood anyway that is just how Barry is. He told Jerry to shut up and she got really hurt. And Fred was pretending to stick his finger up Jerry and her sister and then sticking it in everybody's noses.

Peggy Cass was there and I told her she should do a movie about when they operated on her leg and it was the wrong one and then she was crippled in both. And it was all because she wanted to be a good Catholic and be able to kneel that is how she won the case. Kent Klineman came by the office and he did not like the Annie Oakley and I said how could he not like it since that is the way he made me do it. And so then I asked him if he got the John Wayne thing worked out and he said oh yes that the son Patrick Wayne would give permission if I gave him a painting that he could donate to charity so that was all worked out and I said ""Uh what?"" He said Fred had agreed but I know Fred never would have. I mean this was Klineman's responsibility and I am not going to take it on for him. If Patrick wants a painting Kent can pay me to do it and then he can donate it. And then it was time to go up to the Museum of the American Indian to my opening so I had to ride up to Broadway and 155th Street with him after this fight just forgetting about it and putting it behind us because you have to-these days you have business fights and then just have to go on being friendly. And Crazy Matty's there to greet me drinking wine. it is a courtyard and small buildings. Really nice and they did a nice show. It was packed."

And I brought up ""walk-ins"" and told him how I think somebody might have walked into me when I was shot in addition to somebody maybe walked irto me when I was little. But somehow these walk-in theories do not make total sense to me. He said that if your body is really weak and sick nobody will walk into it. And then I said ""But then people could be walking into you the rest of the time."" I do not get it yet. Cabbed with Jon who is back in town for a couple of days to 32nd Street to see Rambo. And the movie was ridiculous. It was like Friday the 13th but with explosions."

But the New York papers have not really played it up. Daniela Morera gave me a black linen Giorgio Armani jacket and it is too small but it is beautiful no lining the way the Italians are making them now. I had to autograph a copy of the Philosophy book and I was rereading it and I wonder why it did not make it big-it is got a lot of good lines in it.

Should I do it? I do not know I was so exploited in Tootsie. They did not even pay me a cent. Oh it is not worth it you have to sit around all day. Or night. I think it is a night scene.

The cover of the Voice this week is ""Studio 54 and the Mafia"" and when Bob called Stevie to invite him to dinner Stevie made it seem like he was doing us a big favor-""Oh yeah I will come I will do anything for Andy."" We ended up the night at Halston's (cab $4). Stevie was going to be there and Catherine had said we should show loyalty on the competition's opening night. Stevie said ""let us go to Studio."" It was jammed.

Curley had his twenty-fifth birthday and so we sent out for things and had drinks. Thomas Ammann just called to tell me that Fassbinder just killed himself. Well he really was strange. When he came to the office he was reeeally strange. And when I say somebody's strange you know they are strange. He was thirty-seven and did forty movies. Dropped Rupert (cab $5). Went home and was picked up by Richard Weisman to go to the Grease II premiere. Jon was taking Cornelia Guest. The movie was everything I dreamed for. I loved the Pfeiffer girl and the Caulfield boy and Pat Birch's direction was great. It was so good. John Travolta is so dumb for not doing Grease II. What is he doing now?

I gave Brigid the tape of Diana Vreeland and Sharon Hammond but I forgot that for about ten minutes Sharon and I were talking about Brigid on it. I had told Brigid about Diana Vreeland going to Deep Throat. So that sounded funny that is what I thought I was giving Brigid and that is what she thought she was getting. But as Brigid had the earphones in and was listening to the tape she got ten different colors on her face. Sharon was saying things like ""Well yes if Brigid leaves her job yes I would love to take it over."" And then Brigid thought I was being mean giving her the tape but I just forgot we would said anything about her on it. She got so upset she called her sister Chrissy to come over and hold her hand. On the tape I was saying that she got hit by a car-whammo-and that afterwards I would bought her five ice cream cones and Brigid got hysterical when she heard that-she said it was only three cones that the other two were mine. But I think I convinced her she had four. I named the flavors. Chrissy's weight is going up. she is 145 and Brigid is 166.5. Brigid was in a state of shock for the rest of the day she stayed until 6:30. I called Brigid when I got home. She and Chrissy had just gone to dinner and had dessert. I had to think of a way to get Brigid to lose weight and so I told her I would give her $5 for every pound she lost but that she had to give me $10 for every pound she gained. she is bringing her electric scale in to the office tomorrow."

Jessica wants to be a serious actress. she is thirty and she is pretty but she has caps on her teeth I think. They asked me where I found Fran and I said ""In the gutter."" And then they asked me if I would read her book and I said no. I hope it came out right. What they were actually saying was that since she is so good how come she writes for you. I asked Fran to help us interview Jessica and she said she did not do interviews. And then she did not have her column for us so we were upset. She actually did give funny lines though this time. She told Jessica she loved King Kong and Jessica said she had not seen it. And Jessica said to Fran ""I loved your book"" and Fran said ""I have not read it."" Picked up Jed and Paulette Goddard and we limoed to the armory for the Cartier party that Ralph Destino was giving to celebrate the anniversary of the Santos Dumont wristwatch that he got Bob to help get celebrities for. Truman was there in his sailor's cap-he looks like he is lost a lot of weight. it is strange. it is as if they took his face and chiseled off some of it. it is not like he looks younger. it is just thinner. And his scars are all gone. The only one left is the one from the fold on his nose. And Monique Van Vooren was there she said that Nureyev was coming. And I said are you sure and she said ""do not worry if he is getting a free watch he will be here."" And right then he walked in. He really looks so old. Mr. Destino spent so much money to get the airplanes into the armory-the wristwatch was invented for a pilot-and the whole party probably cost about $100000 but it just did not work. Robyn Geddes's mother Caroline Amory was there and Lynn Wyatt and Joanne Herring. And Catherine was there she is very fat but she looks beautiful. Like a sexy English fatso a beautiful body but all filled in. Like a jelly jar. Paulette was wearing so much jewelry it must have been $3 million worth of rubies and she was saying she wants to sell off her paintings and she was saying how much money she had. She decided she did not want the woman's watch that she wanted the man's watch and she told Mr. Destino and he said fine. The watches they were giving were $1300 watches and they gave eight of them and I guess they cost them $600 apiece. Marion Javits did not know who Mr. Destino was and she said to him ""These watches are crap"" and he said ""I am the president of Cartier."" And so she was going crazy because she could not get out of it-literally going crazy. Finally I told her ""Well look Marion it will be a memorable evening for him-he will never forget it."" Bob and I took Paulette home. And Bob was gushing and sentimental and telling Paulette he loved her and so just to make things lighter I said ""Gee Bob you never tell me you love we."" And so I go home and fall asleep and the phone rings and it is Bob saying that he is never said so but that he does love me and I mean what is wrong with him? Is he flipping out?"

She had a limo and the big French poodle sat up front with the chauffeur's cap on. We went over to Bergdorf Goodman's. Halston was giving a fashion show/ benefit for Martha Graham. It was everybody that you always see at Martha Graham benefits. I did not have to buy the $100 ticket Aly did. Met Andrew and Mrs. Goodman the owners of Bergdorf's and they live upstairs over the store. she is Cuban. Saw Pat Cleveland with Esther Phillips. Mrs. Kaiser fell in love with Esther. Then we all went over to Regine's. Mrs. Kaiser Esther and her hairdresser boyfriend. Fred came in with Suzie Frankfurt in a Gres. C.Z. Guest was there with Prince Rupert Loewenstein. Everybody was impressed with Esther. For the first time I danced. It was the first time in public. Esther took me on the floor and taught me how to disco she thought it was funny and I did too. Then the kids wanted to smoke and Aly brought them back to her apartment which was being painted so it was a little messy. She brought out a bag of marijuana. They started smoking. I really like Esther.

Bob was coming after dinner because he was going to a dinner the Hales were giving for the attorney general. Barbara Allen arrived she said she was dropped off by Bill Paley and she broke down after I kidded her about Peter Duchin and she told me she was thinking of going back to Joe Allen. Because she was just fired by Valentino. I did not know that. She said she was hurt and they owed her money and she did not know why they fired her. And I asked her about Peter Duchin and she said he was okay but that he would been married for seventeen years so he already had his habits. She said she was tired of having flings that she thought it might be time to buckle down and become a hostess. She said that she could really make all the other girls jealous with the entertaining she could do. There was Italian food and South American drinks which I had and they were so strong.

She said she was going to have her agent call them. I had a lunch date with Raquel Welch. she would cancelled a few weeks ago and this was a rescheduling. She was bringing her husband this time. When we were originally having the lunch she requested that absolutely nobody else be there but this time we already had about twenty people coming. It was a strange lunch. Raquel and her husband only wanted to talk intellectually so I gave them the works of PH and me-the Philosophy book and Popism. And Raquel just sort of sat on the couch while everybody pretended not to look at her. She was interested in art so we gave them the tour. Susan Blond asked her if she would like to go to the New Wave clubs and she said ""No I am trying to get the Old Wave back because the Old Wave represents quality not these young kids running around doing things."" I mean can you believe it? She said she gave a lecture at UCLA. Bob was frazzled because he said that when you give a lunch that big you do not really accomplish anything that nobody knows why they are there whereas if you have it a small lunch they know they are there to be talked into buying ads. Mary Boone did not know why she was there he said. Anna Wintour who used to work on Viva who got Catherine her job there came up to show Bob an idea for an Interview fashion insert that she would worked on for three months because she thought it was a good idea and he just looked at if for one second and said it was trash and she started crying. And she is such a tough cookie that I could never even imagine her crying but I guess it was her femininity coming out. Later we had to go to Bolero the new club which advertises so we went and it was so strange. it is like a brownstone and you go in and they put you in an elevator and the doors close and it shakes you around and the lights go and then the doors open and you are really on the same floor on the other side! I guess they really wanted you to think you would gone someplace. it is like a fake townhouse-paneled walls and a couple of candelabra. And the ladies there said ""This area is sealed tight and I think you know what that means- that means you can do anything in here anything you want."" it is such a camp."

At the Anta Theater. I went over to pick up Paulette and we went over to the theater. Paulette signed autographs. The play was so cute so unusual. Really beautiful masks of the animals. All the actors have animal faces like the toy things in old French books. Everybody loved it. It could be a hit. I mean if the kids love Peter Pan they will just love this. it is the Argentinian group that broke away from Paloma's husband. Claudette Colbert was with Peter Rogers and for some reason she is always so happy to see me. Jerome Robbins was there I think he helped with it. When they did the speeches in French it must have sounded so elegant but in English Miss Piggy speaks so much better. Then we went across the street to Gallagher's for the after-the-show party. Bianca it turned out never came because she had to wait at the airport for three hours to pick up a painting for Thomas Ammann and she was mad ($10 to the limo). A nice lady came to ask Paulette if she would give her daughter her autograph and Paulette took the lady's hand and lifted it off her shoulder and said ""I hate greasy hands on my white dress."""

I had a meeting with Martin Poll and I did not know why. I walked over to 57th and Seventh Avenue to his office and he said ""We want to do your life story"" and he started talking about the sixties and interweaving four stories and I told him that a wonderful movie had already been made on the sixties and that he should just remake it- The Magic Garden of Stanley Sweetheart-and he said ""I made that movie."" I completely forgot that he had. I did not know that. He discovered Don Johnson. He was going to use Richard Thomas and then changed to Don Johnson. So then I mentioned money and he said ""Money? Money? What money? it is publicity for you."" So I told him he should talk to Fred that what he should do is just buy the rights to Popism and that we would be consultants on the movie. PH would do the script. And then he started talking about Viva and Joe Dallesandro and everything and I ran out of there (newspapers $2 cab $6). Went to Walter Stait's dinner party on East 57th Street (cab $6). Then took Sam to Serendipity. Had a hot fudge sundae and the sugar made me tip so much. I felt generous ($25). Got home turned on Letterman and saw the show they wanted me to be the guest on the one with the monkey with the camera and they had Dr. Ruth Westheimer on. would not it be funny if Dr. Ruth did not really have an accent? Brigid just called and said that at A.A. everybody in the office was there-Don Munroe and Yoko Ono's maid who I like and Kate Harrington and Sue Etkin and no wonder nothing gets done-we have a bunch of drunks working for us. When I called the office yesterday and asked Michael Walsh for a phone number from the Rolodex he was gone two minutes and came back and told me my own number! So I screamed and he said ""Oh sorry I guess hearing your name made me look up your number."""

And Chris keeps wanting to know if he can collect on the watch that I promised him if Jon would ... and I told him no not yet. [NOTE: Although Jon Gould continued to keep an apartment of his own he was now living inAndy's house in the fourth-floor guest room.} And I was worn out from Victor telling me all the gossip about Halston it made me nervous about Halston throwing him out of the car and about Liza wearing a YSL. And this is the night I was going to the party for Liza's father at MOMA. And it was strange because as Victor was telling me about all these fights with Halston he was screaming at me for not being a close close friend to Halston accusing me of remaining on the surface and taking the benefits without the responsibility. Which I do do because I just do not want to be that close to Halston because he can really turn on you. Steve Rubell called while I was talking to Victor and he wanted to go to MOMA with us and so I told him that Jane Holzer and I first were going to the Claus von Bulow party for Catherine. Called Victor and he said he was going to MOMA as Mrs. Halston. The new secretary said that Halston would not be providing transportation so I guess the times are changing.

At first the vet said it was a sore leg and then he said a slipped disc. So I slept on the floor with him last night. I am on the floor now still with the phone being a martyr. So then I was working on the Joan Collins portrait and on some other stuff and then a big four-page telegram came from The Love Boat saying that they wanted to show all my art on The Love Boat too. The story is that I go on The Love Boat and there is a girl on the boat named Mary with her husband and she used to be a superstar of mine and she does not want her husband to know that she used to be ""Marina Del Rey."" And I just have a few lines things like ""Hello Mary."" But one of the lines I have to say is something like ""Art is crass commercialism"" which I do not want to say. PH will be in L.A. then too so we can do some work there on the Party book-photograph the Academy Awards and the Love Boat thing. I will be at the Bel Air. Then went to the Whitney for the opening of the Biennial and waited outside for Jean Michel Basquiat. He had a new smile on his face. We went downstairs and upstairs and saw Kenny Scharf and his wife and it was wall-to-wall four floors. And a woman stopped Jean Michel Basquiat and was raving and raving about him saying ""This is my favorite artist. My husband and I you are our favorite artist"" and I am standing there and I offer her an autographed Interview and she says ""No."" Then we went down to this place on Eighth Avenue and 14th Street where Jean Michel Basquiat gets rice and beans just one of those dirty ratholes that I say I would never eat in but it was so good that I did. And then we called up Paul the exercise trainer who works for Lidija and we were right near his apartment which is right off Abingdon Square down there a nice neighborhood and so we went over there and God it is so strange when you finally see where a person lives and it is just so ... I mean it is this one room and he is been subletting it for a year or so and now the woman who he sublet it from is back and she is about forty and like a hippie who wants to get backing for a restaurant and their beds are just like next to each other and they are not in the apartment at the same time like you feel you can not go home when the other one is there so you feel like you are not really living anyplace	I guess that that is when your life is really interesting though because it keeps you out there in action and getting into weird situations. But I mean I go from that and then I come back up here to (laughs) this it is so abstract. You know? But I do not understand why he could leave the place like such a dump. They should just get futons and not waste space with the beds. And it would really only have taken a couple of hours to pick the place up once while she was gone in Europe all that time. And then we went to Area. Jean Michel Basquiat has the right walk to pass right through the crowd. He made me go to the bathroom there the men's room and it is so funny there there are girls putting on makeup in the mirrors and the men are pissing in the urinals and it would be great if it were not that it smelled like shit. it is just my kind of movie. I guess the ladies room is the same way except without the urinals. Then I got out of there and went home. Oh and that lady at the Whitney who was so thrilled over Jean Michel Basquiat she got him to sign a picture of the painting. that is as good as signing it and then you paste it to the back. that is why Leo sends me up photographs sometimes."

Checked into the Beverly Hills Hotel and they gave us the most horrible rooms. We all sat around Suzie Frankfurt's room while Susan Pile was doing some business with Fred in his room on another floor. Suzie's friend Joan Quinn came by she invited us to dinner at a Mexican restaurant picked us up in two cars. Really great food. Met Joan's husband Jack the lawyer. Went to bed around 1:00.

Jennifer is answering the phones at the office because she is on Easter break and she is mostly sitting on Robyn's lap. We got tickets for the opening of the New Art show at the Whitney the Biennial. And the show is just like the sixties. And Keith Haring is so big he flew from Japan to New York for three days and then to Paris. These kids are selling everything-Jean Michel Basquiat's show sold out in Los Angeles.

Today or tomorrow she is having her eyes done. Vincent was looking in the paper to get the story on the murdered person in Union Square and he finally found it in the Post but there must have been a lot of drugs in the car or something for the policeman to have fired five times. I got dressed really quick to go to the Walter Hoving dinner for John Kluge at 635 Park. Ran over there and Hoveyda was going in at the same time and it was so great to see him I asked him to be my date. I told him I have been meaning to call. Jane Pickens Hoving greeted us and it was a heavy bunch-the Trumps the Bronfmans. And John Kluge and Patricia Gay are getting married in May. Everybody at the party was so old but I liked it. And everybody was so straight and married and I was the only fairy there. I also talked to a beautiful girl from California who is dating Andrew Stein who was there talking to somebody about budgets and he is good-looking and nice and smart. And then everybody was supposed to do some entertainment. Jane Pickens and her sisters were singers they had a really big career. And they asked me to perform and I said that I just could not but I took a picture and then I bowed and they thought I was crazy. Patricia Gay is a raving beauty 6' tall.

Carroll Baker's doing them this week talking about the book she just wrote about her experiences in Africa in 1970. I honestly think it is made up. She probably read a nature book and said those things happened to her. Who would know? She talks about being so hungry she bit off a lizard's head and sucked out the fluid. But I mean maybe she was giving a blow job in a tent and a lizard walked by and she fantasized. I would invited Sam to the opening of the Fellini movie Fred and Ginger at MOMA. I get so involved with Sam you can waste a whole day with somebody and their dumb little problems. And then Fred said ""Why am I working here if you are not going to be a good artist!"" He does not like my work. And I told him that if I did this other stuff the young kids do it better. Really what is life about? You get sick and die. that is it. So you have just got to keep busy. We got to the museum really early. And after it was over Fellini was being photographed and he saw me and he was great he called me over and kissed me on both cheeks and introduced me to his wife who really looks good in person."

So I finally finished shooting that day's scenes on The Love Boat. Got back to the hotel so late and then Fred and I went over to Doug Cramer's right above the Bel Air Hotel in this big house that they are adding rooms to to make it even bigger. And Linda Evans was there and Joan Collins and Morgan Fairchild and James Brolin and the ship captain from The Love Boat-the bald guy. And Calvin came in right from a plane and said that he was not going to have his big party at Steve Rubell's new club for its opening. He said he is spent six months trying to get a new image and he does not want to blow it. I told him that I would bought a bottle of Obsession one of the first and he said why did I go and do that when he would sent me one and I said that I would gotten the one he sent after I would already bought one. It was 10:30 before dinner started. And Shirlee Fonda is still in love with the playwright guy Neil Simon. And Doug Cramer's friend made me take pictures with his 3-D camera. Marcia Weisman was with her new friend. There were beautiful dogs. Thomas Ammann was there and Jody Jacobs from the L.A. Times and the Spellings. And then we went to Mr. Chow's because Jean Michel Basquiat had decided to give his own party there since he had not been invited to the Cramer one.

All the de Menil family was there too because Pierre Schlumberger died (phones $2 newspapers $2). When I got to the office I caught the tail end of a lunch for this guy named Stringfellow who was opening a club on East 21st Street and he acted funny and left in a weird way so I began to think that maybe it was because I had not been at the whole lunch. And Fred did not understand either what the problem was but then later Paige called the girl who was with him and found out that that was the problem that he was offended that I was not there. he is English. But then later on he called and did take an ad.

Gaetana Enders called about eight times to see if our dinner at Le Cirque was still on. She drives me crazy but she is working for us getting portraits so ... she smokes this tiny cigar and she thinks she is this big man's woman so smart and tough and great-this twerp! I mean her husband's 6'6"" and she is 2'2"". I do not know where she gets this idea of herself. I can not even think of who to say it is like. A little like Diane Von Furstenberg.

Then the Time people came down to see it about forty of them. And they stood around saying that it should increase newsstand sales ""by 400"" so I guess they do think about this. Then later the Time guy called me-Rudy-and said they were going to use it. I think the yellow one. And I told him to cross his fingers that it would not get bumped on Saturday and he said he would."

Walked over to office. Ronnie was not at work for two reasons-first because Gigi had run off with Spyro Niarchos the night before at the party and second because Wim Wenders was shooting a movie down at his loft-Dennis Hopper is the star of it. Lee Radziwill and her son Antony came down for lunch. Antony has gotten even bigger. Thicker. She said that since she did not go down to the Washington dinner Zahedi gave me the other week he reacted by sending her champagne and caviar and when she sent a thank-you note he sent more champagne and caviar and when she sent another etc. etc. So he is really going after her. Walter Stait from Philadelphia had called to ask if I wanted to have dinner with him and Ted Carey and I said yes. Ted Carey was having health problems and he went to Dr. Cox and Doc Cox was a good doctor because he recognized the symptoms Ted had and said it was syphilis of the throat. The Doc must have other patients with that problem probably. So he sent him for treatment and the only problem left is that Ted keeps getting worms they keep recurring. At dinner Ted was very good to talk to for Popism we reminisced about when we posed together for our Fairfield Porter portrait.

And Andre Leon Talley did four pages in Women's Wear on it and Fred's picture was not in it. I found out Bianca was out with David Bowie the night before. I dropped Vincent (cab $4) then had to go up to Hoveyda's for a party in connection with the Brooklyn Museum for Helen Hayes. Fred and I were the only different kind of people there the rest were museum types. And Helen Hayes looked beautiful. she is gotten to be a good-looking old woman. She wears the right shades of blue. This time I did not hate her. I used to because in the fifties one time she was going to have a bunch of us Serendipity kids out to her house in Nyack for a swimming pool party and then she got sour and did not. I told her that I loved her TV movie with Fred Astaire-although I actually hated it-and she told me that it was the best thing to say to her because she loved it so much.

And the daughter Eva when she was taking care of my mother when I was in Paris making L'Amour she made me rush right back to New York saying she just had to leave and get on with her life and I told her ""What life?"" She could have just lived in New York and kept taking care of my mother but she would not she went to Denver. Well she is still out there.

So the Basses came and looked at their portraits and I have to change some lips and do a whole bunch of new ones. I was down to 119 and I really got scared. My stomach's shrunk. Ronnie came with me to Art Kane's studio at 28th and Broadway to pose for a ten-page spread in Italian Vogue. There was a Zoli model there who was a stand-in for me and he had a great body. The spread was that this guy was murdering a girl with black panties over his face. The model was the grandson of Goldwater and we are doing him for Interview. Then the panties came off the face and it was actually me who was stabbing the girl in the pictures. So it only took an hour for me to do my part and it was easy-she put her heel in me and it was really fun. Then we left and it was great to walk it was really spring. Got a call from Jon in Hollywood. Then I tried to call Bill Copley all day to make an appointment when we could tape for the play I am dying to do on his life. I had eight dinner invitations. Went to Halston's and Liza Minnelli was there. They had a copy of the Post there that had ""POPE SHOT"" in red. It was great. And then we were talking about bulletproof vests.

And all these kids were wearing Stephen Sprouse outfits I do not know where they get the money. Keith's Juan was in Day-Glo and it was like the sixties. And they have a phrase that is like ""Mark me"" when they want you to sign their stuff. Maybe it is ""Mark me."""

The Doc had to give his own blood test the nurse is on vacation. He said he had not done it himself for years. I peed in the bathroom left a little sample in a jar there for my physical. When I was leaving I noticed that the girl at the desk was writing (laughs) the invitations to the garden party the Doc is giving for me. Went up to a lunch for Sao Schlumberger that Mercedes Kellogg was giving at 775 Park Avenue. Then after the lunch Mr. Bulgari-Nicola-wanted to take Bob and me to his place so we went down (cab $3). He showed us everything all the vaults and he said he would give us advertising. There were separate little rooms where they take customers-I guess people do not like to be seen buying their jewels like massage cubicles. He gave me just what I wanted-a little silver letter opener-but he gave Bob three (laughs) soundtracks from Italian movies. Ran into Henry Geldzahler who was finally his old sixties self to me-really rotten. Henry's the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs of New York City now. Mayor Koch appointed him.

I tried to get Keith on the Interview cover I was thinking it would be good to have an artist on the cover art is so big now but they would not let me. It looks like we are going to use Miguel Bose. Richard Gere has not returned Interview phone calls about being on the cover so I guess he is not a friend. Oh and Paige is upset-Jean Michel Basquiat is really on heroin-and she was crying telling me to do something but what can you do? He got a hole in his nose and he could not do coke anymore and he wanted to still be on something I guess. I guess he wants to be the youngest artist to go. Paige gave him a big art show uptown last month and she is the reason he is been around the office-they are ""involved."""

He was on his bed and he invited us to have some dinner. Bianca was hot for him because she wants to be in one of his movies and he was hot for Bianca because he liked her in her movie. He said that he saw my movie Sleep when he was about twelve and that inspired him to make a movie called Snore. He said it was the most fun interview he would ever done. We were going to invite him down to the office to try to sell him some art but then he suggested it himself. He said he will be back in town on the twenty-seventh and I said I would be out of town but we would arrange something. I dropped Bianca at the Carlyle and I went to Jon's to pick up a script (cab $4). Stayed twenty minutes.

Was picked up by Benjamin and we went out on the highways and byways with our Interviews. And John Reinhold called and said he was leaving town on a trip and wanted to tear a dollar in half like we do and then when he comes back we will put the dollar together and spend it. And Woody Allen won his suit against the look-alike just like Jackie Onassis did against hers. So now the poor Woody Allen look-alike can not work in commercials. They told him that unless (laughs) he became famous in his own right for something he could not pose for ads. is not that something? But I mean why can not they just put ""Model Joe Schmo"" (cabs $3 $5). And I just hate the Trumps because they never bought my Trump Tower portraits. And I also hate them because the cabs on the upper level of their ugly Hyatt Hotel just back up traffic so badly around Grand Central now and it takes me so long to get home (cab $6). Robert Hayes is doing really well he is recovering it was double pneumonia and he had a crying scene with Gael told her that he would been doing too much coke and let himself get run-down and that he will never do it again and that he was going to write me a letter. So it was double pneumonia not AIDS. Jean Michel Basquiat was there but he was nervous about his show and I had to push his hand around the canvas. For the first time in a while he would taken heroin I think so he was moving slow (cab $7). Then went home and Eizo gave Jon and me our shiatsu treatments. And my pain went away. Watched Dynasty and it was the first time Diahann Carroll was on the show and it was so good. What a camp. She meets Alexis and she out-champagnes and out-caviars her-""This champagne is 'burned.' it is been frozen at one point."" I am so sick of the way I live of all this junk and always dragging more home. Just white walls and a clean floor that is all I want. The only chic thing is to have nothing.

Henry was at the office for lunch so that Gerry Ayres could meet him and soak up the art world. Jerry's script that he is writing is actually called The Painter-not Painting-and he is writing it for Jack Nicholson. I should tip Jack off that he should just buy the Jackson Pollock story. Rupert Everett was there he just got kicked out of the Blackstone and now he is at the L'Elysee or vice versa. Henry had his new lover with him that he would picked up from NYU and he was having me take pictures of them kissing. he is going out to California soon to see his old boyfriend Raymond who is out there posing for David Hockney-Raymond takes planes just to go pose. At the end of the lunch Henry said to Gerry Ayres ""But what is the painter going to paint? I mean that is the story so what is it going to be?"" Cabbed uptown ($4.50) to glue and then walked to Sharon Hammond's. I was met at the door by Tony Curtis's wife Leslie who was staying with Sharon she was really looped. She said she was a rich society girl from Boston and how could she marry an actor and a Jew. Sharon was in the bathroom. Her boyfriend Lord Sondes had just left town and they would been eating all the time and this was Sharon's first time in the John after all the food and Leslie said she would walked in on her doing her grunts. And then Sharon's so meticulous with her makeup that it takes forever too. Sharon was surprised when I said I would have a vodka. She has big tits. I would brought a copy of Popism to give to Marty Bregman who we were seeing later because I thought he might be interested in producing a movie of it but of course I had to give it to Leslie. Cabbed to East 57th Street ($3) to Marty Bregman and Cornelia Sharpe's apartment. We went up to the penthouse. It was one of those funny parties with aging girls and sort of funny people. I guess people there were somebodies but stars today look so mousy you just do not notice them. For half an hour I did not notice Al Pacino sitting in the corner. I was not letting Sharon eat because she would gained weight. I introduced her to Al Pacino and so she liked that. He said ""Hi Andy."" Leslie picked up a guy with big hands. He was a hometown friend of Cornelia's and she said ""do not worry""-(laughs)-""she is in good hands."" Cornelia looked fat. And Alan Alda was there with this lady with dark circles and it turned out to be his wife. She looked like Anna Magnani. she is not the wife you would think he would have but she looked nice-I am sure she must be if they are still married. We rode down in the elevator with them. We left Leslie with a stiff drink in her hand. Dropped Sharon ($3)."

And Rupert's been working so hard on these. Edmund is still in a coma. they are talking about pulling the plug out. I am so afraid I will get senile and how will I know? I told PH it was up to her that she is the one I am assigning to tell me when I get senile and she said ""I promise I will tell you but I promise you will not believe me."" Stephen Sprouse called and he was going to the Palladium to Keith's birthday party. We went over to pick up Debbie Harry at the Chelsea (cab $5). The party was fun except that a cute actor named Tim stole my date Sam (laughs) because when Tim said he was staying Sam said ""I think I will too."" I was not upset though I was glad because then that means I do not have to feel guilty about going places with Wilfredo. Really I was.relieved because I do not want to get involved. it is so nice not to get bothered by anybody. Somebody asked me if Sam is homosexual or just immature. I do not know. He likes older women but maybe he wants to be mothered. Who knows? I wish I were twenty and could go through all this again but I never want to go through anything or anybody again in my whole life. Sam and I just kid around. But he cleans up well and he learns things fast. But when somebody corrects him he gets an attitude sometimes and that is hard to change."
"Wednesday, May 22, 1985",[],0.1705246913580247,I found more moths. Andy Friendly still will not give the money for our TV show so I guess we will just do it on our own with Paige trying to get advertisers. Went down to Keith's party at the Palladium and it was packed that huge place-packed! Then decided to go to Private Eyes the video club. It was their Gay Night and jammed wall to wall. These kids if you saw them on the street you would never think they were gay. They look like L.A. kids. Stayed there a few minutes. Then got home at 2:00 (cab $6).

Benjamin was supposed to be in drag when he picked me up to go to the Karl Lagerfeld dinner at the Museum of Modern Art but he was not. We walked right into the elevator with Karl who was sweet. Wearing lipstick with his ponytail. My dinner partner was Fran Lebowitz. She was fun. She does not drink or eat dessert. She smokes constantly though. she is moving out of that apartment in the Village. I guess she lost the case. She sublet it and had Jed do all that work but she never had any signed agreement with the person. And I think Jed really warned her but she did not listen. So now she is moving up to the Osborne across from Carnegie Hall. She was wearing black tie but without the tie. I put a lamb chop in a napkin for the dogs and got blood on my pocket. Dinner was over at 10:30. Then Jean Michel Basquiat was waiting down at Odeon (phone $.90 cab $10). And the Fischl guy came over and said that as he was leaving the house he had the TV show College Bowl Championships on and I was the answer to a question and that the girl from the University of Minnesota got it in a second. It was ""Who painted Marilyn Monroe?"" And I saw the dyke from Artforum who made me do all that free work-doing an original Dollar Sign and then in the same issue she let some guy write the worst review of me that is ever been in the magazine. Then we went over to Area and the theme was ""Red."" And Jean Michel Basquiat's girlfriend Suzanne was there the tiny makeup artist. And Shawn Hausman one of the owners-he is Diane Varsi's son-was on a ladder I thought it was part of the exhibit but he was fixing a fuse. Shawn told me that Eric Goode told him that he is so awed when he sees me that he gets goosebumps. And Fred's been going out with Joan Collins who I guess is having a fling with Mick Flick. I guess that is how these girls get their baubles-as thank-yous after a big night."

Did interviews with Le Monde Le Figaro and Elle that would been arranged by Flammarion our French publisher. Then it was time to go to the Beaubourg to sign Philosophy books at their bookshop (cab $5). Shirley Goldfarb came and Daniel Templon came he is giving the Hammer & Sickle show next Tuesday and about 100 dirty kids in punk clothes. Pontus Hulten the director of the Beaubourg showed up and took us on a tour. First we went into the big Tinguely sculpture being constructed in the middle of the ground floor. He took us to a storeroom stuffed with chocolate and gave us some. It smelled so good the chocolate room. Then we saw the Kienholz show and then the Paris/New York show opening next week and then the permanent collection. This took two hours and Bob was passing out but I had energy and wanted to just rush home and paint and stop doing society portraits.

I did not think I would ever get another one but I decided we might as well be friendly it is easier so we talked about the weather. Zoli told me how when he first came to New York he actually lived on the roof of Chris Makos's building on Waverly and 11th all one summer because he did not have any money. There was a way to get onto the roof and there was a good sleeping chair up there.

Then cab ($4) to meet Paige for her lunch at the office with some advertisers. And the reason Paige sells so many ads is she actually enjoys the people she meets from selling ads she likes entertaining them for business which not many people can do. Then Jean Michel Basquiat came over to paint and he was laughing and kidding around and Paige called up to me on the phone and screamed ""Get him out of here!"" And I just did not know what to say she hung up before I could even think and then she just left the office. She was calling Jean Michel Basquiat a creep and everything. Cabbed to Canastel's ($5) to Katie Ford's dinner where she said she would have male models. And this is the place where the guy wanted me to do a mural for the wall but was not going to give us enough credit-I was going to do it with Jean Michel Basquiat but eventually the wall would have been worth more than the whole restaurant. But this place was great just jammed and pink lights and just really good food and steamed vegetables for appetizers that were as big a serving as the main course at the Odeon. Like California food. So I was with this model with blond hair and piercing black eyes and he knew all about ""walk-ins."" they are when somebody else walks into your body. It makes sense. It happens if you are having this trauma or if you are sick or something. And you know when I was little I remember I was really sick and did not like school and had to be dragged there and then one day I changed-after that I loved school and everything so I think somebody may have walked into me then.... I am not clear on who the walk-ins are. Souls. And I am not clear on where they come from."

But I got back at Bianca-I told her she missed the best fashion show Ossie Clark's. I said ""Oh Bianca it was all just made for you my dear-a beautiful bat-wing dress and a Wonder Woman outfit that you should run right out and get immediately."" (laughs) Because you see she is stuck. she is Halston's friend and Halston's clothes just are not right for her-they make her too short and they cut her body the wrong way. They look like a bad diaper. I mean I like Halston's things because they are simple and that is what American clothes should be but they just do not look good on Bianca she needs to wear more of a costume."

And Jerry said to me ""I am so glad I am sitting next to you because you know to open my own beauty salon/dress place it would only cost a million dollars and I could go to Europe and get all these dresses and do all kinds of beauty treatments-it would be like Giorgio's-and Mick will not give me the money he said it would be too easy to get the money from him that I should go out and do it on my own so is not it wonderful that I am next to you?""

What kind of food is that? Is it French? I knew it must have been handled so much but I was so hungry I ate it. And she has so many Picassos. We talked about restaurants and paintings. Then I said I had to go because Steve Rubell was picking me up to go to a black-tie Democratic dinner. He had a girl driver in a miniskirt and blonde so she looked like Blondie but she was a slow driver and so Steve shoved her aside and took over.

But I mean no restaurant's that big a deal. So I called Henry Geldzahler the commish and he said that okay he would call and try but only because Charles Bluhdorn had given $2 million to the city last year. So he tried and they said it was impossible. So I called Jon back and he was thinking he was going to lose his job but then Bluhdorn cancelled the dinner anyway. Cab to the Ritz ($4). Neil Bogart was giving a Prom Night party. Downstairs one of those boring fans was dancing and smoking joints and acting crazy and he wanted to come upstairs with me but he did not have a pass. I decided to have a hot dog it was Nathan's it was good. And then that kid somehow got up and was sitting with us and then Eva the lady journalist from Stern did a great thing-she started telling him that she did not know what she was doing with the Andy Warhol double. She said she was a second-string reporter at Stern and they did not even get her the real Andy Warhol to interview they got her the double and what was she doing in such a second-rate position and somehow he believed her he just got right up and left and he would not talk to me for the rest of the night.

Do you think they are buying Bill Blass? A girl from WWD was there and she is the type who wears no lipstick and asks tough questions she is going to go far. And the big media news of the day was that Joan Rivers was going into competition with Johnny Carson and it was Barry Diller who got her for the Fox network. she is going to go on a half-hour earlier than Johnny.

And Jackie's picture is so air-brushed he looks fifteen. Blond hair and blue eyes. The English advertising guy Saatchi who wants to buy the Marilyn wanted to pay for it over four years or something so now I do not know. The whole point was to get money fast to pay off the construction guys at the new building. Oh and Ruth Ansel called and said that Marvin Israel died but I did not accept the call because I did not want to accept that he died.

And Cocaine Cowboys has some good music in it. it is a dumb story though. These dealers drop cocaine from a plane and a maid and a secretary find it and steal it.

And Bob said John Fairchild and James Brady were also at Le Cirque so I guess it is the new place for gossipers. Worked all afternoon. Decided to stay home and get rid of my cold. I watched Dynasty and the best thing was the baby getting kidnapped because they used a real baby. You know how usually TV shows use a doll?

Although it did not help me in the bookstore with that girl. Or maybe it did. I do not know. I did just keep signing. I did not panic. And the girl who did it called the office yesterday. She said she does not know why she did it. Maybe she is having a nervous breakdown about it. it will probably become the biggest thing in her life you know? And then we went to 15th Street and Fifth Avenue to meet Paige at the advertising agency that does the Rose's Lime Juice ads. They do the ads with the semi-nobodies and they say they are really doing well with them. The John Lurie ad they said did even better than the James Mathers one and this time they wanted a girl. The semi-celebrities get $5000 and Paige was trying to get it for Tama. I guess it is Tama who is made Paige be desperately looking for boyfriends-that attitude. And Paige is demanding to meet John Lurie-she thinks he is attractive. I guess she will go after him as if he were an ad. Then went back to the office. Worked there till 7:30.

I mean there is a thousand needles sticking in your face. Cabbed to Mr. Chow's for Jean Michel Basquiat's party ($7). And it was great. I feel like I wasted two years running around with Christopher and Peter just kids who talk about the Baths and things when here now I am going around with Jean Michel Basquiat and we are getting so much art work done and then his party was Schnabel and Wim Wenders and Jim Jarmusch who directed Stranger Than Paradise and Clemente and John Waite who sang that great song ''Missing You."" I mean being with a creative crowd you really notice the difference. it is intriguing both ways and I guess both ways are right but ... And now Chris is thanking me for not using him anymore to print up my photographs because he says it is made him hustle more and work harder. And Bianca who I would invited called and was not coming and then was coming and finally she arrived and she acted grand as if she was not looking for movie work. She changed her seat and took Alba's when Alba went to the ladies room and when she came back Alba said in a voice loud enough for Bianca to hear ""she is taken my place again"" meaning like with her husband Clemente but it seemed from how they were acting here like Bianca and Francesco did not know each other. And Jean Michel Basquiat became the hostess with the mostest last night. He said it cost him $12000 -the Cristal was flowing."

So Averil and Vincent and I got drunk and then we left. Averil stopped a limo and asked how much it would be to take us to Bloomingdale's and he said $10 so we got in. Averil said that all the Kennedy kids would be at this opening of the Superman shop. We got there to the Superman shop and it looked like the sixties again. How many times are they going to bring back camp?

And Vincent was in a bad mood because he went to Madison Square Garden TV for a meeting and it looks like they are cancelling our show. They never got the point of our shows-they are a sports network and they said they wanted to branch out but ...

Way Bandy was there and a hairdresser named Harry an English kid just funny and cute and Way was wonderful we talked about health foods and he does not wear too much makeup for day. He looks very good he is had a lot of facelifts and we talked about that. He goes to bed at 11:00 and gets up at 5:00 and spends two and a half hours doing his yoga and everything. Way and the hairdresser each get $1000 a day so I would like to hire him twenty-five times a year to make me up for special occasions but he says he can only fit me in six times. And then they left and two other people came to do me up punk-a black guy and a hairdresser named Mary Lou Green. And they had a Blondie wig so I would look like a girl and then they made me up like Ronald Reagan too.

We have two big ads from Christie's and we are still trying to get Sotheby's. The auction business is so booming. I could not even carry all the catalogues I walked out with. These auction places are so fake though. They just put things out again if they do not sell them and then eventually a sucker who is born every minute comes along. I wish I would thought of that line-""there is a sucker born every minute"" (cabs downtown $3.50 $3). Ran into Edmund Gaultney his opening of my show was at night. It was a show of something you would not think I would do at a place you would not think I would be but he did not tell me the one great thing about it until after it was over-that it was only for one day! is not that great? But he did not tell anybody. I did an interview for Henry Post for a New York magazine article he is doing on elegance things money can buy. I suppose he will probably promote Jed's fancy decorating business in the article. they are friends. Fred and I had a business talk. Bob got some Washington ads because of the Reagan kids' interviews in the issues. Went to the gallery it is at 24 East 82nd and it was really cute. Tom Cashin was there he said he tried out for Oklahoma! and I told him he should try out for Brigadoon he would be better than John Curry. I was standing next to Paloma's husband Mr. Picasso but I just can not remember anybody's name so I could not introduce him to anybody and I think he was mad. Chris Makos was there with Peter Wise and a gay vice-president of Paramount Jon Gould. We went to the Gibbon for dinner. it is half French food and half Japanese. I like the Japanese half better. The headwaiter finally showed his true colors and was a big fairy. Dinner must have cost Edmund a fortune. Home at 12:00."

And Chris is so pushy he said he had a meeting and he is telling the driver of the limo that I am paying for that he is in a big rush and he tells me I do not mind getting dropped a couple of blocks from my house and walking do I. And he booted Craig out he told him (laughs) ""I am sorry but you will have to take a bus or something"" (limo $100). Chris by the way is fat again. He has a two-inch tire around his middle.

She said that the test that they took about ten gallons of blood out of me for the last time had not worked. But they could not do it again this time because they can only do blood tests in the beginning of the week. She said they charged me for it last time but that this second time would be free. And really I think they just brought me up there in person because they did not want to call and tell me to pay my bill so they did it this way. Because there was really nothing that I was there for. The whole place has gotten sort of crazy. But then while I was there someone named ""Saul Steinberg"" called on the phone so maybe it is the really rich one and so Doc Cox does have rich important clients. Then they told me that I had not had any X-rays since 1978 but I said the nurse had done them and then they did find them and I blamed Bubbles for losing them but Doc Cox said that Bubbles never even went near that drawer."

Nobody in Vancouver buys art though-they are not interested in painting. Catherine Guinness [see Introduction] did not get edgy till the last day when she started this annoying thing the English do-asking me over and over ""What exactly is Pop Art?"" It was like the time we interviewed that blues guy Albert King for Interview when she kept asking ""What exactly is soul food?"" So for two hours on the plane she tortured me (cab from La Guardia $13 tip $7-Catherine was grand and gave him the whole $20). Dropped Fred off. Got home.

I went to see him to get rid of a cold and then (laughs) he had one too (cabs $4 $5 $5). I went to Regine's for Cornelia's birthday. Barry Landau was there. Barry's as bad as Cornelia for attracting sleazes. And I guess that means me because I am right in there. But Cornelia's smart she sat Marty Bregman next to her and Roy Cohn on the other side. I sat next to the guy who gives the after-hours party in Aspen after the Jimmy Buffett party. And for a present to Cornelia he offered her his credit card for a couple of hours.

The Deer Hunter was the new kind of movie-three hours of watching torture. It took place in Clairton Pennsylvania where all my cousins are from and in the movie they said it was Russian-Polish but that was just to make it more something because it was really Czechoslovakian. It had John Savage and lots of good-looking kids. It starts off it is three buddies drinking. For a whole hour it is the Polish wedding and they could have cut it but it was fun-so real and so beautiful. It shows a new kind of people in the movies that have not been shown before so it is really good. Then they go shooting some deer so you know that from there it is going to cut to Vietnam. In the end Chris Walken puts the gun to his head and shoots himself dead and Bobby De Niro grabs his hand and says ""Oh darling I love you I love you"" holding his bleeding head something like that. I saw the Daily News girl Liz Smith. No photographers took pictures of me so I guess I am not so much now. Oh and Arthur Miller was at the screening. It was interesting to see him. he is very good-looking. I guess people like that work at it the rich-kind-of-Jewish look. Like I saw on one of the morning shows this twenty-six-year-old kid named I think Schwartz who talked like a Kennedy he was a councilman or something. Arthur Miller looked refined and a straighter face than Richard Avedon but like that. Like a Lehman. I guess they marry good-looking wives and get good-looking children. The news the night before showed pictures of all the houses that people had signed over to the People's Temple when they joined. Oh God that is the hardest thing how could people give away their things?"

Met Americans we knew there-Lita Vietor who was so nice to us in San Francisco and some Palm Beach people they were on a tour. Stopped off at the I.M. Pei hotel and photographed it. Went to a commune and the children came out and they sang ""God Bless America"" and ""Jingle Bells"" and it was disgusting because it was just so sad to see these little kids having to perform like animals. Another truckload of bus people would arrive after us and it would be the same routine and they would hug you same show."

And Don King started an hour-long speech and he was outrageous he was telling everybody that Dustin Hoffman was there and Muhammad Ali and everybody was booing because everybody knew they were not really there (laughs). And then he started talking about ""a young man with a camera"" and then Benjamin was hitting me and saying ""it is you! it is you!"" And all the Jacksons had on dark glasses and would not take them off and would not say anything. And Mrs. Jackson is beautiful."

They had oil clogged in the valves and so they are not going up for a week at least. Then we went to our new building on 33rd and Madison ($4). It was a beautiful sunny day and on the way up all the buildings looked great in the sunlight. Made two calls ($.20). We got to our building and it was just sensational so beautiful you just can not believe it. And the neighborhood has everything all coffee shops all the homemade Puerto Rican kind of food that Ronnie and Robyn like and Jean DeNoyer is opening a new restaurant La Coupole on 32nd Street and the whole area is great. there is a beautiful hotel across the street with whores that they are trying to get out. We went into the building and the best thing is the roof terrace it is like a terrace for a beautiful glamorous apartment.

The girl serving coughed in my tea but I figured that since the tea was so hot it would be sterilized. Then Stuart's driver drove me down to the office and he is great the Brazilian bandleader he got me there really fast. It was pouring rain. Sam was going to go with me on the Forbes yacht but he did not bring a jacket and tie like I would told him to the day before so I disinvited him and took Fred who was thrilled to go. So we went to the boat. This party was to publicize a new line of underwear. James Brady was a lot of fun and Susan Mulcahy was there and Fred was in a skirt-pulling mood. And I talked to Mr. Tisch and his wife and (laughs) we were standing there saying oh-how-tacky something was and right at that moment this lady from Texas came over to me and said that she would just seen the ad for my portraits (laughs) in the Neiman-Marcus Christmas gift catalogue. So that cut me down to size and I started to laugh and Fred gave me a look like ""I hope you are happy"" but he was laughing too. he is still so mad that I okayed it for their catalogue while he was away in Europe. So that was really funny."

And the Jasper Johns that should have gone for $2 million went for $700000. I do not know why the de Menils and Dagny did not sell the paintings privately why they put them at auction. Oh and Philip Johnson bought the Stamps for $150000. He was bidding against Thomas Ammann. That should have gone for $500000 though.

Cabbed to the airport ($20). Jean Michel Basquiat and I went to the back of the plane and he was smoking joints and I realized that he would left his brand-new Comme des Garcons coat in the hotel room when he would been rolling and he called and I called but they will never send it. He knows just what looks good on him. he is 6' -or 6'1"" with his hair. he is really big. Got a cab into Manhattan ($22). Then went to 33rd Street and sat in my room and made phone calls. The boiler was broken and it was freezing in there. And I want to take the key away from those two bathrooms outside my office because every other minute somebody's going in and out and I can not stand it the constant production of peeing all day. I am going to make the Interview kids go upstairs to one of those bathrooms or something because who wants to hear that all day. I went to Private Eyes (cab $7). Scott was at the door so he let us right in. Madonna was on the platform and since Jean Michel Basquiat had once been involved with her we started to go up and the bouncer said ""Step aside for Mr. Warhol"" and then tried to block Jean Michel Basquiat and I said that it was okay he was with me. And Madonna kissed Jean Michel Basquiat on the mouth but she was with Jellybean who said he would heard his pictures in Interview made him look 6' tall so he was thrilled because he is 2'. And Jean Michel Basquiat was moody because Madonna got so big and he would lost her. And Dianne Brill tried to get on the platform and the guy just pushed her back and I said ""do not you know who that is? it is Dianne Brill"" but he still would not let her up. And she was so conspicuous in her rubber outfit and Frederick's of Hollywood stuff and everything so she was really humiliated and that is the way things go-you think you have so much pizzazz and then something like that happens in front of your friends. it is happened to me. Sometime someplace it happens to everybody. And I told her I would talk to the P.R. girl but she said no that it was okay."

I have always thought he worked for the CIA and I still do. I just can not take it. Hold on I am going to shut it off.... There I feel so much better now. Cocktails at Tatiana Liberman's were fun. Barbara Rose was there sitting in all these clothes that were so expensive but she still has no style. I told her we would rent her a fag and he could take her around and tell her what to buy and how to put it together. I said ""Well you are living in a chic building now Barbara""-in the Galleria-""so you should really start to look chic."" I tried to be diplomatic but everything just came out like the truth. C.Z. Guest had a dinner at Le Cirque. Kim D'Estainville and Helene Rochas were there they said that they would just been in California and they drove miles to the Venice galleries because they wanted to see some ""regional"" art and then when they got there there was my porno show! So they had a good laugh. They loved Big Sur. Oh and David Whitney called and said he was going out to California and Philip Johnson had given him a first-class ticket and he said ""Oh Philip you should not have. I do not need it"" and so Philip cashed it in for coach! At dinner I was next to Doris Duke. She was great. Then afterwards everyone was going to Studio 54 and Bob took most of the ladies in his silver limo and Doris Duke had a station wagon it was so chic. We got into that. Then when we got there she wanted to leave-she did not want her picture taken-so I took her to her car and went back. I saw the John Scribner boy and Robyn and James Curley-he is a Mellon-he is the cute kid whose father was ambassador to Ireland. Catherine was there and she is unhappy with her job at Viva. She said she wished she were back at Interview with Bob screaming at her she said every article has to have a dozen meetings about it. I said I would take her home. It was around 2:00 (cab $4)."

He had Roy Cohn on. Roy Cohn is now Stevie Rubell's lawyer. Also Carmine Galante's. He was incredible such a creep. He was saying Archie Bunker things like ""If I could get my hands on the Son of Sam I would kill him myself"" and talking about the ""reds"" and this crazy-looking person goes into courtrooms he looks like such a creep. You could just imagine him like down at the Anvil in black leather he would look so perfect. I bet he does go to those places. He would. Or maybe he is just the opposite. Yeah he is probably just the opposite-he wears dresses. But the things he was saying like ""Put everybody in the chair""-it was like hearing Paul Morrissey talk.... Yeah they asked him how he could defend Mafia people since he is so concerned about everything and it was that ""rights"" thing. It always is you know-""They have a right to say they are not Mafia and to be defended."" I was the centerfold of the Post a photo in front of the Sports paintings with a text by Jerry Tallmer. But I keep saying the wrong things. I said that athletes were better than movie stars and I do not know what I am talking about because athletes are all the new movie stars. And here we are getting all this publicity and it is a month ahead of when the opening is. I think it should be more toward the opening. I read John Simon's review attacking the way Liza looks. He was just so awful. I mean if she ever saw that it would just crush her so badly. And she is actually nice-looking I mean I see her she is not hard to look at. What does John Simon think he is doing? His philosophy must be that only good-looking people should entertain and I guess that is what I think too. But Liza is not ugly! I was also on the front page of the Voice photographed next to the empress of Iran for an article about torture in Iran. Fred had tickets to the International Center of Photography benefit that Jackie O. was putting on at the museum up on Fifth and 94th. I asked Jed if he wanted to come but he said he was too tired (cab $2). Big mansion. The dinner was a horror. They put us at such a nothing nobody table. You can not imagine-I was sitting next to Fred! So here we were in this room where we did not even recognize anybody except each other and this girl comes over to me and says ""I know you have a camera and you can take pictures of everyone here except Mrs. Onassis."" I did not think too much of it right then I just thought she was one of those nervous-type girls who run these events. And then that rich old guy Nate Cummings was screaming at Fred to open a window and at first Fred was offended-Nate Cummings somehow picked him to scream at-but then Fred figured out he was turning senile so he decided to be a nice boy and do it and then the girl started screaming at Fred not to. And Fred's going to call her up and really tell her off because things got much worse. We got up and left that room and Fred went to find Diana Vreeland and when we walked into the other room there was everybody we knew! Peter Beard was having fun with Barbara Allen and Lacey Neuhaus. I mean Catherine was sitting at Jackie's table! But that is not the most incredible thing. When we walked into this room there were 4000 photographers taking pictures of Jackie. And that horrible girl had come over to tell me Icouldn't! Fred's really going to scream at her. It was like a Bobby Zarem event there were so many cameras flashing. I cabbed with Fred and Diana Vreeland to Sutton Place to Robin West's party for Jamie Wyeth. I did not have any change so I gave Fred $5. He gave the money to the guy the fare was $2.80 and he told him to keep $.60 and the guy said ""How much is that?"" and Fred started screaming ""I can not do your adding for you."" And all the way down in the cab Diana and Fred had been fighting like they were a screaming old married couple. And the cab driver was butting into the conversation with ""was not that Peter Beard's opening I picked you up outside of? was not he on the cover of the Sunday Times?"" I talked to Carole Coleman from New Orleans. she is Jimmy Coleman's sister. Then Bo Polk came into the room and it got crazy. he would met Carole at a bar and they would gone out and now he said things like ""I want to eat your pussy"" and on and on like that they were just talking in front of me and Carole was not even embarrassed. I was surprised because she is older than most of the girls Bo Polk goes after. She has beautiful eyes and she is rich and never married she could have been like Jennifer O'Neill but she has problems I guess and not too many boyfriends but very attractive. And he was saying things like ""I want to lick your toes and up to and into your cunt"" and then he would turn to me and say ""I want you to be there and take pictures Andy"" and oh he is just nuts. I went to say hello to Phyllis Wyeth and then Bo Polk and John Larsen came over and Bo yelled to some girl that he would put some coke on her clit and John laughed and called him a coke tease. And then Bo and Carole left. But then in a few minutes they came back in and talked about if they should leave and she wanted to know what they were going to do and that went on and on. And then Carole and Bo and Jay Mellon and Catherine and I left and walked. We passed a place that had Famous Amos cookies in the window. I had never seen the package. It was the most beautiful picture of a cookie that I have ever seen and I went in and bought it but when I opened the package the cookies were really little. It was the first time I was ever deceived! They tasted good but they were not big and beautiful like the one on the package."

Then John Reinhold picked us up to see Charles Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company's play Reverse Psychology down on Sheridan Square (cab $6 tickets $32). We had good seats and the play was good because it was so real. it is about a man and a woman psychiatrist who have a couple of patients who go off to an island and take a drug called PU which makes them love whoever they did not and vice versa and it was fun worth going to see because the fights were so real. John and I decided to go see what Bobby Short was really like so we went to the Carlyle (cab $4.50) and Bobby was there singing away and I was reminiscing about seeing him in the old days when John brought me back to reality-he told me that Shirley Goldfarb went to heaven. Then Bobby was starting to come over so we paid up and ran out quickly ($68.30). Got home about 1:30.

He still wants to rent part of my house-the second floor-to show his paintings in and I do not know how to get out of it because you can not keep that kind of thing a secret people would know it was my house. it is just a little too hard. And Paige is really upset because Jean Michel Basquiat has not called her. He has not called us either. She sells his paintings she is been doing that for a while. And he dropped Mary Boone-she took 50 percent Paige only takes 10 percent. he is still with Bruno though so that is how he will still be shown. I told Paige that Jean Michel Basquiat was after Joanna Carson in Milan and maybe I should not have. Paige said she might just forget him that it had to be all or nothing. But naturally people are people and a fool is a fool so no matter what they say they will just go on being in love.

He had not wanted to leave it in the hotel room so he had it with him and he just forgot and left it in the cab. And that can happen to anybody. it is so scary. He said he could never replace them that it was all sentimental value his whole life mementos. So lunch was just for Linda Christian's son.

And I just could not believe him. I mean I just could not believe him. Did he think I was going to sit there and ask her how often do they do it? And then Bob told me that I look like a fool on the runway doing my modeling jobs. I told him I did not care and he said that he cared that it made his job harder if I looked like a fool. Worked till 7:00."

Had a meeting with some South American lady to pick out her painting. She brought a couple of beautiful Venezuelan ladies with her. And the infamous Ronnie Levin came down. Somebody had warned me he was in town so it was not a shock. Nobody paid attention to him at the office and he walked around like he owned the place and then he left.

The kid is really good-looking he could be the best of all those models. Chris you know as usual (laughs) sees himself as a young boy in this kid. His name is Ken. Walked to work. Stuart called and wanted to be sure we were coming to the party at Buccellati's to raise money for his art school. I told Paige I would meet her there at 8:00. Her and Wilfredo. Sam had a typing class. So at 8:00 Paige called and said where was I? And I went to Buccellati's (cab $3) and outside I said to Wilfredo ""I am afraid to go in"" and this man who was standing nearby (laughs) came over and said ""that is very interesting. I am a psychiatrist and I am staying at the Waldorf if you want to get in touch with me about this because I specialize in phobias."" It was just like a Peter Sellers movie. So Stuart was there and Paige made a faux pas and told Barbara Guggenheim about all the musicales Stuart's been having and Barbara did not know anything about them.

Then Gloria von Thurn und Taxis the fairy princess came to the office for lunch with her husband the fifty-eight-year-old fairy prince that she married when she was twenty or something and got on the cover of every German magazine because he is the billionaire who needed kids for heirs. And now they have three kids. And Betsy Bloomingdale was there too. Prince Johannes von Thurn und Taxis started some dirty talking. He said that when he was young and he went to Hollywood and met Marilyn Monroe that she came on to him and invited him over for dinner but he said he was not into women then-he said this out loud. They talk like that. And the wife talks about boys and then he talks about boys with big cocks. it is very abstract. So anyway he said that he asked Marilyn Monroe who else was going to be there and she said a few names and he arrives and Marilyn comes out in a decollete negligee and he said ""Where are the other people?"" and she said ""They all cancelled."" So they had pink champagne and then dinner and then she pulled a little string and she was standing there stark naked and he could not ... so he said he just banged her on the knockers and said ""See you later toots."" He said that he could have pretended and they could have just wrapped themselves around each other but that-he repeated it again-he was not into women then. She must have known how rich he was. Or else maybe he was good-looking. Because he did also say that Pablo Picasso once saw him and wanted to do his portrait and said he would do two and give him one but he thought it was just some old guy after his body. This was on the beach. But I do not know if his stories are true. They probably are but he remembers some things about me that I do not so ... Like he says he once invited me out and that I said I was sick and that then he called me at home and I was not there but I know I never gave him my home phone number. And then I walked them to their limos and Gloria wanted a cock drawn on her Interview. And Fred said this was our first society party in the new building. But it would have been great in the ballroom. But it is leaking up there. And Fred had tables built on the roof! I do not know why. And his little dining room is nice but it is not the same."

We asked the manager to find one for us told him that it would be autographed by O.J. Simpson and Andy Warhol. O.J. arrived. He remembered Regine's and asked about Marisa Berenson-they presented an Oscar together last year-and was so sweet. He had a five-day beard and I thought the pictures would be awful but Fred said no that they would be sexy and he was right they were. O.J. is so good-looking.

The good-looking Glorious Food waiter who is getting his master's in psychiatry at Columbia had invited me to dinner. But then I got cold feet and told him I had to do an interview with Bob which I did not. He was going to show me around Columbia. But I just can not go out with people I do not know. But then it is hard to take girls places because you have to pick them up. it is easier to go out with boys who will pick you up. I am getting like Mrs. Vreeland. On channel 2 they had a hidden camera on some 1980 census workers drinking and taking cocaine on the job and then sitting down and making up names to fill out forms because they got $4 a name.

We were all on different floors-I was in 1801 Chris in 1020 Fred in 820 and his girlfriend Natasha Grenfell in 722. I had a suite overlooking the harbor it was very beautiful but everyone said Hong Kong was having a recession. And then after we got straightened up Alfred wanted us to go to the I Club to look at it it was just a block away in the Bank of America on the first floor and it still was not finished they had three days to finish it. And we met the designer of it Joe D'Urso. He said he would decorated all of Calvin's apartments. Alfred is so pretty-a spoiled cute kid just adorable. And Joe D'Urso is this fat little slob but really talented. Went back to the hotel called New York.

Bruno came by and saw a painting that Jean Michel Basquiat was not finished with yet and he said ""I want it I want it"" and so he gave him money and took it and I felt funny because nobody's done that for me in so long. that is the way it used to be. I was going to the party on Malcolm Forbes's boat for Imelda Marcos. It was sort of embarrassing because I thought I was late but I was early. Most of the people were so old and they were all from my street East 66th Street-I guess it must be the richest street in the world. Imelda lives on it between Fifth and Madison. Lee Radziwill came. She looked good in a short haircut. Imelda's gotten a little too fat though so if I did her picture I would want to do it from the old days when she was Miss Philippines in the pageant. She was being a hostess and she sang later on after dinner she sang about twelve songs-""Feelings"" and then that song from the war you know the oozy-doozy-bowsy-lowsy one. Oh what is it? ""Mares Eat Oats."" Everybody said that once Imelda gets started partying you can not stop her that she is always the last to leave and it was true she was going strong. Then cabbed to Mr. Chow's where Jean Michel Basquiat was having a birthday party for this girl who'd talked him into having it for her. He had Diego Cortez and Clemente and people and when I got there he was asleep snoring actually. We woke him up to pay the check because I was not going to get this one. Got home and I turned on the Letterman show and there was-Malcolm Forbes! Talking about everything. And I thought Gee what a great name for a magazine Forbes. They just named it their name. And I started thinking about a magazine called Warhol. (laughs) No no I do not love my name so much. I always wanted to change it. When I was little I was going to take ""Morningstar"" Andy Morningstar. I thought it was so beautiful. And I came so close to actually using it for my career. This was before the book Marjorie Morningstar. I just liked the name it was my favorite."

Finally on November 2 he did.] Okay let us get it over with. Wednesday. The day my biggest nightmare came true. The day started with Benjamin not picking me up (phone $2 magazines $2). I did not go to the Matsuda fashion show. I am just going to talk through this quickly because otherwise I can not face it. Nobody from the office would go with me to the Rizzoli Bookstore in Soho but Rupert's old assistant Bernard had stopped by to visit and he said he would. Rupert dropped us off. The store is long and the signing was on the second floor in the balcony. I would been signing America books for an hour or so when this girl in line handed me hers to sign and then she-did what she did. The Diary can write itself here. [She pulled Andy's wig off and threw it over the balcony to a male who ran out of the store with it. Bernard held the female while the store called the police but Andy declined to press charges. The staff at Rizzoli asked him if he would like to stop but there were people with books still waiting so he said no that he would finish. The Calvin Klein coat he was wearing had a hood so he pulled it up over his head and kept signing.] I do not know what held me back from pushing her over the balcony. She was so pretty and well-dressed. I guess I called her a bitch or something and asked how she could do it. But it is okay I do not care-if a picture gets published it does. There were so many people with cameras. Maybe it will be the cover of Details I do not know. If I would have hit the girl or something then I would have been wrong and there would be lawsuits and everything. it is getting violent out there again like the sixties. I usually stand up at those things but there I was sitting down and people were above me and the setup was all wrong and I was so worn out and hating Craig Nelson and I was not fast enough and it just happened so fast and Bernard was really sweet. But you know you are in this place and everybody's being so nice and you do not think anything will happen. She was really pretty a nice-looking well-dressed girl. They had her cornered for a while and then they let her go. It was too unusual. I guess these people had gone around telling everybody they were going to do it because a lot of people later said they would heard things. It was so shocking. It hurt. Physically. And it hurt that nobody had warned me. And I had just gotten another magic crystal which is supposed to protect me and keep things like this from happening. So I was too nerve-racked it was like in a movie. I signed for one and a half hours more I guess pretending that it did not mean anything and eventually it does not. You have to live with it. It was like getting shot again it was not real. I was just the comedian there pleasing the people. And it was so close to Halloween. Then Bernard dropped me and I gave him $10. And I got home and had two English muffins with margarine which is not so good and garlic and two cups of tea and carrot juice and I tried the Campbell's dry soup. It was good. And no accessories in it. And then PH called to see what time I was leaving for Washington in the morning but I got off the phone fast I did not tell her what happened because I could not face it. She found out though I guess because she called back an hour later and told me she was proud of me and that I was ""a great man."" And (laughs) that sure was a first. So that is that and now I never have to talk about it again."

So I stayed uptown in the morning and then met Elizinha Goncalves and Bob at the Mayfair House and we walked over to Maxwell's Plum and when we were half a block away Bobby Zarem ran toward us and screamed that we were late and how dare we and that people were going to leave. But it was actually good timing that we got there late because people were waiting to see us. It was crowded we had to work our way in. Karen Lerner was there filming for the segment she is doing on me for 20/20. She attached an invisible mike to me so I had to remember to watch what I said. It was a press party and it was basically everybody Bobby wanted to pay back for favors I guess. They had big AW initials in ice three feet high but it was melting. I did not eat anything. Everybody got a free book at least 100 were given out. The waiters stole lots of books and then asked me to autograph them in the kitchen but I did not mind because they were nice. Catherine was asking Steve Rubell personal questions like ""You mean you actually did take all that money?"" but he did not seem to care. Now he is saying he made a deal with the IRS where he will be going to jail for two days a week doing community service-teaching people how to make discotheques on army bases for the soldiers. What a brilliant idea. Next they will teach them how to be fairies and take drugs right? Later we went over in a cab to Studio 54. Halloween was so big this year people were really dressed up in the cars outfits with lights blinking. At Studio 54 the place was done up just great. You walked in and there were ten doors on each side and you had to go through each one and there were mice in plastic running under your feet. And another room had a hole and you looked in and there were eight midgets having dinner and you could talk to them. They were eating chicken bones. And then in the next room there were all these rubber gloves and some were real hands. It was better than an art opening better than a gallery show. There were some other rooms I did not go into. It was all great. Jammed wall-to-wall people beautiful I do not know where they came from. And Esme the top model was there with Allen Finkelstein but I would not have recognized them if Tommy Pashun the florist had not told me because they were dressed as Hasidic Jews and they said that they were so amazed that everyone was being so mean to them. A makeup guy at one of the Broadway plays had made them up. Dropped Catherine at 3:00 (cab $3.50)."

I think he is going to be the Big Black Painter. It was one of his sort of big paintings. I think Jean Michel Basquiat's early stuff is sort of better because then he was just painting and now he has to think about stuff to paint to sell. And how many screaming Negroes can you do? Well I guess you can do them forever but ... And he bought a $700 mask for Halloween yesterday. Mexican. He just spends money. He did give up the room at the Ritz Carlton and he does not take limos now so that is an improvement. But what he should do-and I have told him this-is keep his early paintings and store them so that he will have them to sell later on. Because Bruno just buys up everything and then sells them off slowly. But Jean Michel Basquiat really should be keeping them for a nest egg. The paintings that get good prices are Rauschenberg's early pieces and anything by Jasper and Cy Twombly. Wesselmann's sort of selling off ... Rosenquist's prices are just medium but I think he is the best I really do. I guess I am going to finally face moving out of 860 because Stephen Sprouse has rented the place. Glued myself together picked up Gael and we walked to Jams to meet Fred. And this dinner was really horrible. It was just me complaining. I should have been like a cheerleader saying ""What can we do to make our magazine even better than the wonderful thing it is?"" But it did not turn out that way. Gael was explaining the printing costs. And really I should have been positive. I know that you get more out of people by encouraging them. Although I did encourage someone once-Chris Makos. And what I got out of that is that this week they are auctioning off a picture of me in drag from the ones he took. And Gael was not eating so I thought it was because I would made her upset but it turned out that she was just trying to diet because she is gotten really fat. But she just rubs me the wrong way-she thinks she is so great or something. We just do not communicate. I do not know if she is stupid or if she just plays dumb so she will not have to do what you are telling her to do (dinner $140). Then we talked about the covers when would be the Mick when the Health issue when Mickey Rourke. It was just a very frustrating dinner nothing was accomplished just arguing. It was all my fault. We all would have been better off going to a Halloween party. Fred walked us both home."

I had not thought Jean Michel Basquiat would come but while I was waiting in line at the airport he appeared he was just so nutty but cute and adorable. He had not slept in four days he said he was going to watch me sleep. He had snot all over the place. He was blowing his nose in paper bags. It was as bad as Christopher. Paige has turned him into sort of a gentleman though because now he is taking baths. We arrived in Milan practically on time. Arrived at the famous hotel I forget the name.

We were driving up to Charles Rydell's house in Port Jervis to interview him on his bit part in Union City. Then went to pick up Doc Cox on 72nd Street he was late. Doc Cox was driving us up there in his Rolls. He told Brigid she could not smoke in the car that it would ruin the smell of the good leather and she started to go crazy-when she wanted to have a cigarette she had to lean her head out so she was in a bad mood. We got there and the Doc mixed martinis and Brigid had one her first of the day. I took pictures. Brigid ran out to pick ""fresh tom-ah-toes"" but by the end of the day she was drunk and they were just tom-ay-toes. I went out and picked plums and we were eating them-even though they did have so much bug spray on them they were so good. I had about ten. Then I picked cherry tomatoes and real tomatoes. Brigid was drinking martinis out in the tomato patch and she lost her martini glass in the patch. Brigid and Charles kept talking about ""lunch at Flo-Jean lunch at Flo-Jean"" and saying ""you have never seen anything like it in your life."" And the more they kept saying that the more you just wanted to hate it. But we got there and well you have never seen anything like it in your life. it is the sickest restaurant I think I have ever been to. A big rambling restaurant run by Flo and Jean and filled with baby dolls a million of them. All colors. Because the place is very colorful. Napkins that're pink and green and yellow-just really a lot of color. Either Flo or Jean said her husband died in 1929. The food was the worst but there was a lot of it. I gained four pounds and all I had was mashed potatoes and sweet relish. We had a lot of drinks there Brigid went on with her martinis. Charles paid for the lunch but I bought souvenirs. Everybody had a good time. This restaurant had rooms and rooms that just went on and on and they have weddings and parties there. It took up like a fourth of the Delaware River. Brigid was drunk she kissed all the waitresses. Then she began telling me food stories she would never told before like how she once went to the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Station and ordered a three-pound lobster and a nice waitress brought it to her but it did not look like three pounds to Brigid. Brigid said ""I am a compulsive eater and I know my food and this is not a three-pound lobster."" This lobster was costing like $39. The waitress said ""Oh I am sure it is."" So Brigid said ""Then let us go weigh it and if this lobster is three pounds I will give you $10."" So they went into the kitchen and put it on a scale and it weighed less than one pound! So the waitress was really embarrassed and said they would not charge her. Brigid was by now wacko drunk really drunk. I watched TV on Charles's Betamax. Charles has porno movies but they are all straight porno movies like the Debbie Dallas one. He only likes straight porno because he (laughs) only likes straight guys. So I watched those. we would finished lunch at 5:30 but Charles was taking us to dinner at 6:00. Oh and it turned out Brigid made out with the farmhand down the road once when she visited Charles. Charles said to her ""Did you fuck the farmboy down the road? he is been acting different with me ever since you were here."" And she confessed that she had. It was one afternoon when she was alone and only 125 pounds. She decided she wanted some creme fraiche and that she would go right to the cows. So she walked and walked and she came upon a farmhand. And now this farmhand acts funny with Charles because he thinks it was Charles's wife or girlfriend that he fucked. And a hustler came by who only charges $30 because it is just a small town. it is really a gay Peyton Place. Doc Cox drove us back and dropped us off."

Instead of working (laughs) he wants to be wanted. But if he worked he would be wanted. And Fred is really tough on Sam. And on everybody. Fred is unbelievable. I can not believe how he is changed. When something's done wrong he just says ""Get out!"" Just like that. ""Get out!"" Just like Mrs. Vreeland. Steven Greenberg was taking a whole group of us to the Color of Money Actor's Studio benefit and he was picking me up in his limo so I was trying to lock up and there was a problem so I left Vincent there with it and went to the Ziegfeld with Steven Greenberg. We walked in right behind Tom Cruise and Paul Newman so nobody paid any attention to us. Paige got me popcorn. Saw Aidan Quinn and Mariel Hemingway and her husband. I sat with Cornelia who was more like her old friendly self and Jane Holzer and Rusty came. And Victor Hugo was there and Ellen Burstyn made a speech and Paul Newman did. And the movie I slept through most of it. I just was not interested in pool and nothing was explained. And Paul Newman should have had sex with the girl then at least there could have been conflicts. You did not know why anybody was doing anything and you did not care but there were funny lines. Everybody ""in"" was there. And then I rode down to the party at the Palladium with Halston and they would done the place up like a big gambling casino-huge pool-ball balloons on the ceiling different colors it was like walking into Studio 54 in the old days because they really did a big theme number. But it was so boring. Then Paige insisted on escorting me home. I do not know why she gets that way. I am not a baby-as long as I get a cab I am fine."
"Wednesday, October 9, 1985",[Sylvia Miles],-0.06122766122766123,The news was all about the boat trouble the Achille Lauro seajacking in Egypt. And now probably everybody will be watching The Love Boat this week because of it with my episode on it. So many people are telling me they are planning to watch it. Gael came in and sighed and said she was trying so hard to find someone for Tama. Why is everyone so worried about Tama getting a new boyfriend? But blind date dinners are a fun idea. You find someone they do not even have to be any good you just bring them and somebody may actually like them you never know. And I killed a roach and it was a trauma. A very big trauma. I felt really terrible. So then it was time for the blind-date dinner. I was actually doing it because I want Tama to write about me in one of her stories I want to get into them. And it is a great new way to meet new crowds. Everybody brings a blind date for somebody else. I brought Dr. Bernsohn for Tama and she is funny like a Jewish mother-she dressed in Chinese clothes because we were going to Mr. Chow's and she had on crystal earrings so that the crystal doctor would look at them. But now I am afraid she will write about Bernsohn and that he will get into trouble. Because see using crystals to heal and stuff is not really legit. Oh and the night before when Tama was standing next to Sylvia Miles I just thought give her twenty more years and she will be Sylvia-she would had a few drinks and her hair was disheveled. And Tama is desperate-she said she got a phone call that was a wrong number but she made a date with the guy anyway. The guy was trying to call his ex-girlfriend who was getting married and then after he talked to Tama he did get the ex-girlfriend and he told her about what had happened and now she is coming on the date with Tama and him. This is how desperate people are (cab $5 dinner $350). And my guy oh God I just hated him from the start. The one they brought for me. It was this gay kid Paige had met the other night and he was a student at Columbia. I ran into Gerard he works for the Parks Department now in the zoo building opposite 64th Street. And Dr. Bernsohn was interested in Paige at the beginning because Tama looks like his mother that type. I have met his mother. And the guy from the wrong number that Tama's going to see is in the Egyptian delegation at the you.N. so you can imagine. They originally had a doctor for me but he had to go on duty at the last minute. And my date went off to call his boyfriend. But it is fascinating to meet new people. Then the Ford model I got for Paige disappeared. But she was disappointed anyway because he was an airhead he could only talk model talk. And we ran into Holly Woodlawn who was celebrating her facelift-yes she had one! she is telling everyone. With all her problems she got a facelift! She never did get a sex change I do not think. Paige dropped me off.

We got to Diane Von Furstenberg's and it was absolutely nobody we knew and Diane was nowhere around to introduce us so we just sat and giggled. Then Richard Gere and Silvinha came. They were just back from Fire Island. Marina Schiano and Thomas Ammann were after Richard. They were putting down Fire Island and I said it was the greatest place in the world. I told Richard I bet nobody asked for his autograph because you know how cool those fairies are out there and Marina had to make a comment ""Well they did not ask for yours but you can be sure they asked for his."" You know Marina. And Richard told Bob (laughs) ""No pictures please."" Food was fried chicken that could have been from the Colonel's and chocolate cake. Diane's kids are beautiful. As we were leaving she came over and said ""Oh my dear did not you meet the prince of Thailand?"" And she pointed out this kid that we thought was a waiter. I mean he could have worked at the vegetable stand on the corner. But she never even introduced us! And we would been dying to meet him. he is tinier than Rupert. Dark hair. Left Barbara and Silvinha and Thomas Ammann staring at Richard Gere. John Samuels they dropped-he was looking around nervously wanting to go to the Ritz to see some group like ""The Coconuts"" or something. Had a sleepless night."

Went to Richard's and Kathleen Turner in real life is so chic and worldly. She says she is about to star opposite Jack Nicholson in something that I did not get the name of because I felt I should know it. And she just got married to this guy Jay and they are a funny couple. he is about my height but with heels on she was taller than him. He started out in Lance Loud's band the Mumps and then he worked for his father and then he went into business with this friend of his and bought all these real estate properties in the slump of '74 when they were cheap and he became a millionaire. And Richard had a girl there who was like Judy Holliday but dumb for real. Really dumb. I have not met a girl like this for a long long time. I do not know where she would come from. She was an airline stewardess. She said to me ""Gee you look peculiar"" and they said ""he is an artist"" and she said ""I have a sister who is an artist yeah and she looks peculiar like you too."" And then she asked me if I did something to my hair. And then Richard took her upstairs to talk to her."

We were supposed to visit Peggy Guggenheim's collection so we started moving. In the lobby there was a photographer who began to take pictures of me and continued all during the trip back across the Laguna. Doug then took us to II Prisione where my show would be. it is not a prison it was a fancy men's club it is next to the Doge's Palace. it is a good space with high ceilings but not too big. The white board for hanging went all around the wall but Doug wanted to paint it flesh-colored. The man in charge there took us up to the roof to show us a big cloth banner that said ANDY WARHOL and the dates of the show 16 September-8 October. There was another one in San Marco Square under the clock and another one on the way towards Accademia. Jed photographed them. At Peggy's we looked around at everything. John Hornsbee the curator asked Peggy if she wanted to receive us and she said no. she is sick. And we did not really want to see her anyway.

So many Jewish newspapers are coming to interview me about the Ten Jewish Geniuses-Jewish Day Jewish Week Jewish Month-and Fred thinks I should not do any more interviews for a while that I have been doing too many. And he is right. I walked home glued myself together. Thomas Ammann was picking me up to go to Sondra Gilman's party. It was for Nick Roeg but Nick was gone when we got there. It was so hot there people were sweating. Sylvia Miles was there and Sylvia acts so funny she feels like we have dropped her and she says she wants to ""renew our relationship."" But whenever she invites me to be her date someplace it is always someplace that I have already been invited to so I have to tell her that I am already going and that I am taking somebody. And she told the best gossip-that Joe Dallesandro is now living with Paul Jabara. No wonder he has not been calling for money. Sondra had some interesting people there-like Tony Walton the stage designer. Sondra looked great in this beautiful bright yellow silk dress-the color I used on the Debbie Harry portrait-and it made her look so young eight years old and we asked her who made it because it was really pretty and she said ""you will fall over if I tell you."" So she told us and Bob and I did fall over-it was a Diane Von Furstenberg. Off the rack for $120. It really was pretty. Sondra produced the new Nick Roeg movie Bad Timing with Art Garfunkel and that girl I think I met there Teresa Russell she did not look like anything. The food was awful. We left and Sondra was still serving quail eggs they have a quail-egg farm."

And Charles told him ""But I am Charles Rydell."" And the kid looked at him closely and said ""Oh yes it is you is not it."" I mean this was so abstract. Charles comes in for French lessons once a week and he brought this kid with him to the office. And everybody's talking about the Bass husband Sid leaving his wife for Mercedes Kellogg. And at the Calvin Klein thing I ran into the Daily News columnist Billy Norwich who said his real name was Billy Goldberg but that he is from Norwich Connecticut and he said he kept calling Mercedes in Paris to try to get a comment and she would not return his calls so finally he left a message with the desk that it was Mick Jagger and she called him back in five seconds-""Hi Mick! And he said ""it is not Mick Mercedes-it is Billy Norwich"" and she said ""You devil how dare you do this!"" And he said ""you are talking to the press anyway so why not give me a tidbit."" It was ""Suzy"" who broke the big story. If I were Anne Bass I would take a gun and shoot Mercedes. Can you imagine just stealing another woman's husband?"

I handed him a dollar and told him to beat it but he did not he stayed with me. And he is skinnier and dirtier and he had a sore leg and was limping so that was sad-he is been walking the streets too much. And then I went to Dr. Bernsohn's. I was in there a long time finding out about the ghost they were throwing out. Judy the secretary would not come in for three days and then she did and caught Dr. Bernsohn crying because the force was so strong. And they said he should not have called the ghost because he is Jewish that Judy should have done it because she is Catholic and more easygoing and it is different than if they were telling you some phony stuff. I mean why would they make this kind of stuff up? It must be real. So I left there. And Matty was still waiting. I told Matty he should go to museums and auctions and be learning things. He should get a job at one of these places and stop being on the outside and he had a long answer for that-something about being in a plane and zeroing in on Madison Avenue and killing the Jews. He was talking about that a lot. The thing is we have the same life. We go to all the same places. He kept saying how attractive I am. But all I am attracting is him (magazines and newspapers $4). And the Campbell Soup Company hated the painting they commissioned. It turns out they wanted exactly what they would said-a painting of their new box. I would tried to do something clever and make it more but they hated it and now I have to do it over again. And the horrible news of the day was that finally after not hearing from Sandy Gallin about the Dolly Parton portraits I called and the secretary got on and said ""Ohhh Sandy's soooo embarrassed"" and saying that it just does not look like my art. Sandy just does not like the pictures she said. And after fifteen minutes she popped the question of could he get his $10000 back. And I said ""Well sure you know but does not he want me to do it again!"" She said they would thought it would be more colorful more Pop. But I mean I should have known because it all started out so strange with Dolly calling and saying that she was the one who wanted to buy it-as a gift for Sandy-and then that was just so they could get a better price I guess because when I said ""Well I would like to give you one Dolly for being so nice to Sandy to give these to him"" they called back and said ""Well since you were going to give a free one why not just knock down the price instead?"" You know? Hollywood. Well I have learned things. Next time I am going to make them work for it like come in and see if they like the pictures and everything every single step of the way-make them work hard. Oh and then they even said that I could try to sell it. They said they would give ""permission."" So that was horrible."

Cabbed to Union Square and walked to office (cab $3 kitchen supplies $125). The building had just finished painting the downstairs lobby. They made it Puerto Rican colors and you just hate to walk into it. Mr. Marcus was a funny little man. I was trying to sneak some cole slaw and he caught me eating. We were expecting Fred back from Europe but he never arrived. Rupert came by. Curley came and took the umbrella I would borrowed from the Heinzes a few nights ago back to them. Jack Heinz had called about it and said it was his favorite one. I told Carole Rogers at Interview to try to register the word Out as the title for a magazine and she said the only way to register it is to actually do up a dummy of a magazine with that name. Because I want to start another newspaper-one that is younger than Interview because Interview's so established now. Dropped Rupert ($4) and got into black tie and went to pick up Suzie Frankfurt and Bob. We walked to the Pierre for the Gianni Versace fashion show. Gianni Versace was at our table but not until after the show. And Carrie Donovan was there who always gave me my first jobs. Andre Leon Talley was next to me and he is just such a camp. And that guy who does not like us from Women's Wear what is his name? Michael Coady he was at the table with his I guess girlfriend and this time he was nice actually. And Ludovic who runs Regine's. The fashion show had Joe MacDonald and European girls. It was funny fabrics-lace and suede and leather. The clothes he makes this year are very feminine though kind of draped and ugly. At the end he got emotional and (laughs) cried. Ludovic invited us to Regine's but we were going to first go to a party Nelson had invited us to for Michael O'Donoghue who wrote Mondo Video a movie that is coming out. I paid for a limo we got ($15) to Tango Palace on 47th and Broadway and the place looked like the old Factory with silver tinfoil on the walls. And the dime-a-dance girls now cost $20-a-second. A lady with breasts as big as Geri Miller's in Trash was there vulgar dancing. The party was disgusting the creepiest kids came over and talked to me. A band called The Clits was playing. Richard Turley was there and he loved the place.
"Wednesday, September 2, 1981",[Barry Diller],0.013938961038961039,"-Colorado-New York The papers were full of me and my age. They all gave my age. That school's going to become one of the best schools because they are really intelligent. They had this course called something like ""Wind Tunnel"" and the professor puts models of big buildings into a tunnel and blows the air through to see what happens to them. With all the wind pressure. He said there were five very dangerous buildings in this country but he would not tell us which ones and I kept saying (laughs) ""What about the Gulf + Western?"" And so then we had to go to our next stop a class where they collect semen from a bull. And they brought the biggest bulls with flies on them that you could ever imagine. They had this poor little animal-he had his head stuck in a thing-and the guy said ""This is a steer and when he was young other male steers would jump on him he is just one of these strange animals that give off the wrong hormones."" And so as soon as they saw that happening they pulled him out and segregated him and now he is being used in this experiment to get fucked by a big bull. And there was a big bull sitting there waiting. Christopher ran out of film and he was going nuts he wanted to get the big cock out. So they get the bull over and let him mount the steer and he gives out some juice but they do not want that juice. His cock is like a two-foot pencil. it is pointed. So the guy said ""Wait I have to get the artificial vagina."" So he ran in and got the glove and everything and then the bull mounted again and he ejaculated really fast and the whole thing was over. Then we went into the office and watched while the guy took the sperm out of the artificial vagina. All of us slept on the way to the airport for some reason except Chris he said he was going to spend the night in Denver and go to the Baths. Watching the bull must have got him really hot. Got to New York our driver was waiting for us. Dropped Fred off and he gave me my underwear which was in his bag then dropped Bob off. Tipped the driver ($40). Bob had the best news because he got the job he tried out for on the new Paramount TV show Entertainment Tonight. Barry Diller called him up and told him."

It did not come in the morning so we did not get on the flight at noon. But right after 12:00 it arrived so the driver picked me up at 860 and then we picked up Fred and drove out to Newark to get a plane. The driver was nice (tip $10). The plane left on time. What we were really having to go out there for was a dinner that Marcia Weisman was giving. That meant we would be missing the big glamorous YSL Opium party in New York on the Chinese boat downtown at the South Street pier. Checked into our hotel L'Ermitage. it is for people who do not want to be discovered-if you are having an affair that is the place to go. there is no lobby and it is chic in a funky way. It was very elegant. When you pick up your key you get to pick a four-number combination so I was 1111 and Fred was 2222.

As soon as we landed Richard called the girls' number and they arranged to meet at midnight in Richard's room. Then we went to the motel Vitas said to. It was almost a dump but it was okay like every other motel like being at a Holiday Inn with a pool and everything. As soon as we checked in there we went to another motel the one that Jack Nicklaus owned to meet him. We waited while he talked on the phone. He looked fat but Richard said that he was once 280 and was now down to 180. He was very suntanned but his eyes around them were white where his sunglasses were and his hands were tiny and white he wears gloves on the course. His hair was blond and he said something about needing a haircut but I had the feeling that his hair was just the way it always looked puffed just-so over the ears like it was ""coifed."" I started taking pictures but none of them were coming out good. it is so hard taking pictures of suntanned people because they come out so red. He was being friendly and Richard was trying to be friendly but somehow the situation was strained he did not understand what was going on. And I had my tape recorder with me and was taping but when I sort of realized that he would not understand that I just quietly shut it off. Richard's secretary Claudia showed him pictures I would done of Tom Seaver Muhammad Ali and Pele but he still did not really understand why we were there taking pictures of him. Richard had sent him a book showing my paintings but he did not understand the style. And then he got another phone call and we were getting nervous and I took some more pictures and he did not like any and we did not like any. Not getting good pictures made things more and more awkward and finally he said ""Well you know what you want-you do not tell me how to tee off on the green"" and I felt more uncomfortable and everyone just wished we could leave. Then finally he liked one but it was just nothing a front shot and I did not see any difference between the rest of them and that one but he said he did not want to be looking-what is the word? it is like cocky but it is a short word-he did not want to look like that and he thought this one made him look like a nice person. He talked about his wife and his kids. Forgot to say that when I was taking the pictures there was not a golf club around they were all down on the course. He went around to some of the offices asking if anyone had clubs and finally came back with some that he said were just like his and I did not know that golf clubs have hats on them with drawstrings. We ran out and dished the whole thing in the car and that is when it suddenly occurred to me that he actually had looked like he might be lonely and maybe we should have invited him out with us but he had not suggested anything himself and nobody just knew what to do so nothing happened. We looked around for a place to have dinner. Fred and I wanted to go back to New York right after taking the pictures but the only flight out went to Atlanta first. We saw a building with about twenty floors and there was a restaurant at the top that moved around in a circle. We decided not to go to that and then decided that we would go there after all. It had some name like River House. It was next to a Howard Johnson's. We went up in the elevator and sat down in the restaurant and it began to revolve. There were ladies there playing harps. Then we went back to Richard's room with him to wait for the girls that were coming at 12:00 and had tequila with him. When the girls called on the phone he asked them to bring some jeans and a T-shirt for Claudia because they would all go nightclubbing and she had not brought anything to wear. Claudia used to be an airline stewardess and I guess that is where Richard met her. she is very pretty and she is the best secretary. She just does everything. The girls arrived and they looked like New York models very tall and blonde and pretty and they were wearing the same kind of clothes jeans and T-shirts. One of the girls was more the hustler and she went after Richard. All they could talk about was Vitas so they called him in New York. The clothes they brought for Claudia fit perfectly. Fred and I went to our rooms. They were big and clean and everything but you would wake up every half-hour because of the air conditioning. I slept in my clothes because I knew there was a six of the clock wake-up call."
"Wednesday, September 23, 1981",[Peter Brant],-0.02152777777777777,I had to meet Peter Brant for lunch at the office. Also there was a woman who'd called me she brought a portrait back because a little girl threw an apple at it and I have to fix it. So Peter Brant came and he was just awful. He picked out some prints and now we are all settled with him on the money he invested in Bad and he never has to come back. Good. Christopher picked me up and we went to my modeling job at Saks (cab $7). Took Rupert with us and they thought he was a messenger. Two of Halston's models were there-Alma who was nice and a blonde one who ignored me. These models are funny I guess they think I am taking their jobs away by being a model.

Got to the hotel checked in. At 7:00 went to Steve Martindale's cocktail party where we saw Liz Carpenter who said she still wanted her portrait done but then I asked Ina Ginsburg if Liz was serious and Ina said ""Well I think you should tell her the price."" I guess she does not know it costs $2 5000. Ina said she will probably have a heart attack. Liz Carpenter kept saying ""you have got to Xerox me."" Instead of Polaroid. ""When are you going to Xerox me darling?"" And then we went off to another party for the Dyke Women of the Year. You know the dykey types-what is it called? ""Outstanding Women."" And the first person I was introduced to was this creepy guy who said that Viva was in town and that he was going to be her lawyer in a lawsuit. He was saying ""Viva's very unhappy about the situations of the past"" implying that she wanted to sue us and I was saying ""Well Viva makes her own problems. I mean they are not mine."" It was very creepy just absolutely creepy. it is just those kind of creeps who make problems. The kind that want to start trouble over nothing. Oh but actually when I think about it Viva could never stand being with this guy for one second. Then we took the brownies Ina had in the car over to Senator Heinz's. Jamie and Phyllis Wyeth were there. And then Liz Taylor came in with John Warner and she came over and was really sweet and then later she came back to our table and had dinner with us. John would bring me a full glass of wine but he would bring Liz a thimbleful and she would say ""Well what happened?"" and he would say ""Oh I do not know it was the bartender he just did not give me enough."" And I met Mrs. Kassebaum the daughter of Alf Landon the only lady senator. A lot of tough broads but funny ones. There was a Portuguese guitarist there because Mrs. Heinz is Portuguese from Mozambique. We toured the house a beautiful house and they have really rich great paintings. They have a Copley. And Mrs. Heinz made the food it was not Heinz it was Portuguese duck and rice but I just had one helping. Ina dropped us off at the hotel. Went upstairs and they would left a package of Godiva chocolates and I ate the centers out of them. I opened every center. And they left a bottle of brandy so I drank that. And a basket of fruit and I ate all the kiwis. Got sugared up and I guess I passed out but I woke up an hour later."

She would not come for lunch. Who does she think she is? Worked till 8:00. Sam stayed on. Fred looked in the book and saw all the Diana Ross and Cher and Warren stuff and started to tell me that when I saw Warren to behave myself or something -he thought it was real too-and I just cut him off. Sam must have told him about my ""big week""-he still does not know it is all a joke. I regret doing it now because it is all going to turn out to be cruel because Wilfredo is laughing behind his hand about it and everybody at the office is in on the joke watching Sam being nice to me waiting to be invited to these dinners and oh I will just have to tell him that these dinners were all cancelled at the last minute or something."

A girl. There was an American guy who was like de Antonio being Communist-Peter Davis he did a movie called Hearts and Minds. And Clemente the Italian artist was there and gee I like him a lot-he is picked up the American attitude. He understands American humor which is so strange because you do not understand how a person from another country can pick it up. He does not say much he just sits and eats and watches. Bianca's trying to get him to do a free mural for her apartment. she is buttering up all the artists. And this other guy at the lunch had been a political prisoner somewhere in South America I think and now he works for Mitterrand. It turned into a five-hour lunch. The Nicaraguan cultural minister girl did not get there until late. she is almost as pretty as Bianca. And she says ""Oh yes people think we do not have art in a revolution but even as the bombs are falling and the bullets are flying people are still making art. We have dancers and painters and photographers and we are becoming unionized	""I mean ... and then she was saying how the true revolution is really winning out that ""the people are having their day."" And I do not know it was all so abstract but then being at that big Heinz party the other night with all those rich Republicans I got a creepy feeling there too. it is like any people when they have the power they do not want anyone else to ever get it. it is like women trying to keep their husbands away from seeing what young girls look like. But I guess that is not only the rich. Anyway they are saying they want us to come down to Nicaragua and and I do not know support their art because. And Clemente is saying ""Oh yeah sure and lose the green card I went through so much to get."" And then when we were finally done the rebel girl got into her limousine and the Socialist who works for Mitterrand got into his limousine and we went down to Clemente's loft which is right next to Tower Records and his loft is just beautiful. it is really an artist's loft big paintings all over. He produces a lot. So many paintings. And the Mitterrand guy was awful he walked on one of them that was on the floor and pretended he thought it was a rug but I just know he knew it was a painting. Then they wanted to see my ""studio"" so we went to the office and there was just nothing there. The contrast was so-evident. we have gotten so involved with fashion that we do not know about all these other things like wars and governments anymore. I did not have any art to show them. They wanted to see movies but I did not have any movies either. So finally they all left. I worked till 7:30 and Cornelia called and asked where I was because she was ready and I had a black tie down there so I just stuck it on and went to the Waldorf Towers. I asked her to be downstairs since we were late but she said ""I do not want to wait downstairs like a prostitute."" So when I got there the doorman was so dumb after fifteen minutes of me sitting in the cab he came out and said there was no Mr. Warhol staying there. So I did it myself rang Cornelia's room and she came down in a red dress looking like a hooker. But beautiful. she is put on a little weight. Oh and I saw Mrs. Douglas MacArthur while I was waiting and she was great. she is eighty-four or something and still has all her marbles. And me I can barely walk. So then Cornelia came and we went to the Pierre (cab $8) to this fashion show for charity that Joanne Winship organized. Oh and at lunch I brought up the Liz Smith items about Calvin and his model Kelly to Bianca saying the papers said they were such a hot item and Bianca said ""Ha-ha! What a joke!"" So that is her position."

The Princess Holstein in Interview was upset because I was doing a poster for Joseph Beuys's Green Party she said it was a tragedy that somebody like me would do it that it was a Socialist party and I did not know what to do. She told Bob she did not know if she could continue working for a person who would make a political statement without even knowing what it meant. Fred told her it was none of her business.
"Wednesday, September 3, 1986","[David Patowsky, Ric Ocasek, Richard M. Nixon, Stephen Sprouse]",-0.025367441698086846,"The morning started off with the bad news that our Ric Ocasek video was cancelled after Vincent had worked for a week scouting locations. Stephen Sprouse came and brought me the Debbie album he did the cover for and it looks great clever he really is a good art director he knows how to use his handwriting and everything. Ric Ocasek came by he felt guilty. Robyn came by and Fred got mad at me for not wanting him to work there again. Fred says Robyn's a changed person but there is so much action in New York I do not know if he is doing a smart thing to come back. Now he knows how to silkscreen. Then my nephew who knows the software came and he was waiting for the other kid who knows hardware and they were going to talk to Gael. His friend's name is David Patowsky or something like that. he is from Pittsburgh too. These kids should change their names before they come to New York. Yoko called and invited me to the Medea Japanese thing in the park. I invited Jay and we cabbed up to Yoko's and the traffic was so bad it took an hour to get to West 72nd Street (cab $7.50). When we got to the Dakota we saw the limo was still there we went upstairs and they were all just leaving they would called and found out it was a ""rain or shine"" concert and it was really raining I forgot to say that. So we went and we sat in the park and it was the first day I did not wear my double jacket and it was pouring. Sean left. I started chewing gum just to keep warm. It was a modern version of a Japanese group doing Medea. It stopped raining. Afterwards we had to go backstage and the Japanese are so interested in me for some reason. They interviewed me and Yoko. Ran into a lot of friends I have not seen in forty years. Then got into the limo and went back to Yoko's and she had store-bought food it was like the way we entertain at the office. Sean talked to us he was being friendly but he was bored. But Jay knew the secret of how you tear a phone book in half-you bake it in the oven until it gets dry and then you can tear it and I said ""Well Sean if you are bored why do not you learn how to read the phone book. I mean do you know the last person in the phone book? Do you know the first person?"" So then we started looking and he called information and asked them for the number of AAAAAAAA Bar and they would say ""The AAAAAAAA Bar? Yes sir."" And then we called and asked for Richard M. Nixon's number and they said ""Wait a minute"" and then there was a click like they were tracing us and Sean got scared and hung up and then I scared him by telling him that it was not really hung up even when you hang it up. And then Sam- Yoko's Sam-called the White House and a recording said if you wanted to talk to President Reagan to call back between 1:00 and 5:00 in the afternoon. And then we dialed F-you-C-K-Y-O-you and L-O-V-E-Y-O-you to see what happened so we had so much fun."
"Wednesday, September 30, 1981",[],0.0893939393939394,Nelson came up with the script for Saturday Night Live and I was getting cold feet about the thing. I made an appointment to see Dr. Rees the plastic surgeon. I stopped taking the vitamins and I feel much better.
"Wednesday, September 4, 1985",[Martin Burgoyne],0.30303030303030304,"I can not tell which nights Fred's been drinking and which nights he has not. I do not know if he is grand when he drinks or grand when he does not. it is like he thinks he is Conde Nast or something. And I said that the Stallone issue of Interview was great but that I can not see it paying for itself. And he said yes yes that he knew very well how much it cost that he knew ev-er-y-thing. And I said ""Oh well okay if you know everything you know everything. But I remember that time when we had a big debt nobody knew about but if you know everything that is great."" Went to Keith's party in his new loft (cab $3). And Keith had a good group too a lot of girls. Martin Burgoyne was there and he told me that Madonna was upset because we let People photograph the paintings Keith and I gave her for a wedding present. they would called me and I said no but then I told them that if they wanted to try Keith they should just call him. So Martin said Madonna hates us for that and I told Martin he should have made her not hate us."
"Wednesday, September 5, 1979","[Charles Evans, Claude Montana, Richard Gere]",0.11162405303030302,It was the beginning of hurricane weather outside grey. I wandered around passed out Interviews-the Liza new ones-and thought about Montauk. They said this hurricane is traveling the path of the one in 1938 and that is when Montauk took a beating. I ran into Charles Evans and he gave me a ride and we had a good talk about all the girls he knows. Picked Bob up at 7:45 and went to the Magno screening room to see Yanks. I invited Curley and he and Bob loved the movie but I could not stand it. It was a forties movie and if you want to see a forties movie they are on TV all the time and you can have great-looking people like Tyrone Power not Richard Gere! The movie had no war and no bombing. After the movie we went to a Claude Montana fashion show at Studio 54. It was just finishing. Larissa said that Claude Montana was a genius and she asked me if I wanted to meet him. I would seen the big photograph of him out in the front this eight-foot figure and she pulled over this little twerp of five feet with a mustache and American clothes and said it was him and that he was shy.
"Wednesday, September 6, 1978",[Toni Brown],-0.06964646464646464,"Went to the garment center with the girls from Interview to sell copies of the magazine there even though I was nervous because on the news the night before there was a new outbreak of Legionnaires' Disease on 35th Street between Sixth and Seventh that now they think is caused by a bacteria that forms in air-conditioning systems. Blue Cross called to say that Ronnie sent them a doctor's bill he wanted compensation for- when he was murdering the cats they struggled against him and he got scratched. Toni Brown came up and she wants me to do the cover of High Times. I told her she should not have told Carole that I said she was crazy and then I had to call Carole and say ""I did not say you were crazy I said you were crazy"" and then (laughs) she understood. it is so funny when you just say the same word but in a heavier way and then people understand. Cabbed to the Waldorf ($3). There was a party in honor of me because this was the day we were supposed to leave for Iran but then the civil war broke out. The Hoveydas looked really suntanned and healthy. Mrs. Hoveyda said she did not know anything about what was going on in Iran because her husband would not tell her and he just said ""If things were really bad would I be sitting here tonight?"""
"Wednesday, September 7, 1977",[],0.00925925925925926,-Paris Phone rang. It was Paloma for Fred but he was not in his bed. Decided that I could not worry about him anymore. Paloma had a lunch date with him and said that she would call back. About 1:00 he arrived and she called back so we all got ready to go meet her. Cabbed to Angelina's ($2). Paloma was wearing all red YSL. Talked about old romances and old happenings out of the past. Paloma picked up the check.
"Wednesday, September 7, 1983","[Matt Dillon, Robert Hayes, Shirley MacLaine]",0.09375,I called Robert Hayes. Told him about getting Matt Dillon for the cover and he was excited about that but he did not like my idea of Shirley MacLaine. I am trying to sell magazines. Maybe those ladies who watch Donahue will buy Interview if they see Shirley on the cover.
